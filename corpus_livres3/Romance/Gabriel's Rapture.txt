(Warning: Spoilers ahead!)There’s a longstanding belief that sequels don’t live up to the original, “The Godfather Part II” notwithstanding. That makes it all the more pleasurable to read “Gabriel’s Rapture,” because the book disproves that axiom so thoroughly. It takes the superb groundwork set in the first book, “Gabriel’s Inferno,” and builds upon it to give the reader a rich and rewarding continuation of Gabriel and Julia’s story.We meet up with the couple where we left them at the end of “Gabriel’s Inferno:” in Florence, where they’ve deepened their passionate affair while immersing themselves in all this cultured city has to offer. Sylvain Reynard draws us into the beauty of Italy and makes us feel as if we’re experiencing everything along with Gabriel and Julia. Glorious artwork, most of which is housed in the Uffizi museum, is highlighted. A number of musical selections provide a lovely accompaniment to the couple’s tender moments. There are romantic dinners, and even more romantic and erotic tangos in museums and their hotel room. The reader sees and feels these perfect touches, and it’s another testament to Reynard’s writing that it’s a sensual experience for us, too. When Gabriel and Julia have intimate moments in Florence or Umbria, readers feel as if we are right there with them, and it makes us wish all the more that we could be.Even as we’re enjoying this sojourn in one of the loveliest countries in the world, we get the sense that it can’t last. Vacations never do, right? Neither does that heady sensation that comes when you find your other half and love them body and soul for the first time. Surely enough, shortly after Gabriel and Julia return to Toronto and their daily lives, they find that reality has intruded in the form of a complaint that threatens to reveal their love affair, which is prohibited by University of Toronto policies that forbid fraternization between teachers and students. As the investigation into their relationship grows more serious, it becomes apparent that Julia’s career will be short-circuited before it even starts. In order to spare her, Gabriel sacrifices himself at the altar of academic bureaucracy, but the ultimate penalty is that it means the end of their relationship.It’s heartbreaking to see the bitter turn of events, particularly since we know both Julia and Gabriel bear responsibility for what happened, though Gabriel seems to shoulder more guilt. (As the professor and academic mentor, and certainly the more experienced of the couple, he’s probably right to do so.) After so many struggles to acknowledge their love for each other – so many misfires and miscommunications, so much anger and fear over their separate pasts – they finally fulfilled the destiny ordained by their night in the orchard so many years ago, only to have it denied by the very institution that, ironically, reunited them.And yet...and yet...I came away realizing that if they hadn’t gone through this separation, they may not have survived as a couple despite their great love. They were better off because they grew individually and were forced to mature emotionally on their own. The heartbreak they endured gave them a better respect for what they had and almost lost. It’s an astonishing thing to see because as you’re reading it, you realize how rare it is. They acknowledge that the first rush of love, while real, couldn’t be sustained because they’d pinned too many of their dreams on it. And in the process, they��d idealized each other in a way that also couldn’t be maintained, and ultimately, could have undermined the strength of their genuine bond if the University hadn’t interfered. In a way, they owe Toronto a debt of gratitude for it.Julia is understandably devastated by the separation. Having been so careful to trust Gabriel, she feels as if she’s been duped and begins to doubt that he ever loved her. She tries to reach him but the only communication is a brief e-mail from Gabriel that bluntly tells her to stop. She even goes to his condo and finds that everything is gone, except for the clothes that he’d bought for her just months ago, when their feelings for each other still lay just under the surface of their skin. It’s especially heartbreaking to watch Julia’s efforts to complete her Master’s degree in Dante studies, a subject that’s an emotional minefield considering that it reunited her with Gabriel. But she perseveres and even thrives under the supportive friendship of Paul and the firm, guiding hand of her advisor, Katherine Picton.Gabriel embarks on a journey he hoped he would never have to take; one where he’s alone, without Julia. Before their relationship, Gabriel lived an empty, dissatisfied existence – one with professional fulfillment but without hope of finding the love and grace he truly craved. He’s forced back into that existence now that he and Julia parted, and it’s especially cruel for Gabriel. Having finally known true joy and unselfish love, he feels the loss all the more bitterly. Reynard skillfully draws a picture of a man again skating along the edge of his own destruction, driven to despair by the loss of a woman who inspired the redemption he believed was always out of reach. But just as we worry that Gabriel’s old vices will again draw him under, we see that the virtues learned in his time with Julia have had a lasting effect. He returns to Italy, at first to mourn, but then to find faith and grace in his circumstances. We also see another facet of the Professor’s genius as we gradually realize he’d planned a way out of their situation that would help both of them.But the real victory – the real uplifting part of this story – is Julia’s newfound strength. She mourns, too, but is determined to forge ahead with the life’s work she’s chosen for herself and her studies. A romantic alternative is offered to her, but Julia knows it would be unfair to both of them for her to settle when it comes to love. Even when Gabriel returns, she doesn’t accept him easily. She’s wary, careful; though her heart is sure he’s its ultimate destination, she has now seen too much to fall back into old patterns. On the one hand, it’s almost humorous that she makes him work so hard for it, but on the other, it makes perfect sense, and it’s brilliant. Julia comes out of adversity and heartbreak a smarter, stronger woman. And she knows what’s at stake. If she and Gabriel are to truly flourish together, they need to confront their weaknesses and the issues that they tend to repress. I came away from this book loving Julia almost as much as Gabriel does.At the end of the story, I thought of one of my favorite quotes, from “Zoo Story” by Edward Albee: “Sometimes it’s necessary to go a long distance out of the way in order to come back a short distance correctly.” Julia and Gabriel were forced away from each other, but they were smart enough to appreciate the lessons learned from the experience. They loved each other enough to allow it, and they put those lessons to good use once they returned to each other.There are literary and artistic references within the sequel, as there are in “Gabriel’s Inferno.” I found these genuinely enhanced my reading experience, as they often sparked an interest in finding out more about a painting or in reading a book I hadn’t considered before.One last thought: Gabriel’s Rapture is again told through the eyes of the Snarky Narrator. His wry humor and asides are a welcome part of the series. I’m really fond of him, and I’ve come to think of him as the couple’s guardian angel. Even though he’s as pointed and sarcastic as ever, you sense that he wants the best for Gabriel and Julia.
