✅ Beauty and the Beast retelling (but much spicier and kinkier)✅ Smut✅ Funny✅ Strong heroine✅ Pace🆗✅ Intrigue❗️❗️ Explicit sexual scenes❗️❗️ Also, there is some explicit (sexual) language in the quotes included in this review“You’ll need that fire before the end. Mark my words, princess, before this is all over, I will ruin you.”Wow, this book was funny and entertaining! And such a quick read, it was exactly what I needed today! Honestly, I had no idea I was nearing the end, I was so engrossed in this story, I just thought my Kindle stopped working when I reached the last page of the book…Our mad king had used the demon king’s sly magic to settle a personal grudge, and we were all suffering the consequences. Actually, he wasn’t. He’d died and left us to rot. What a peach. They hadn’t said what he’d died from, but I hoped it was gangrene of the dick.Finley is a shifter, living in a shifter village with her shifter family… Or what is left of her family after the Demon King’s curse made almost everyone sick. Because of the curse, shifter can’t access their animal side anymore, and the dragons who were ruling the lands and tasked with protecting its people are no longer there. Even worse, nasty demons and horrifying creatures have taken over the kingdom and are even entering the villages. Finley tries her best to survive and help her village, but that means entering the forbidden forest and taking some plants to brew herbal remedies. When she gets caught by The Beast of the wood, she is forced to go live with him in the castle as a punishment for her thieving (but let’s face it, it’s just an excuse the Beast found to keep her because he found her attractive and intriguing).“Don’t take any chances,” Hannon said. “If you see the beast, get out of there.”“If I see the beast, I’ll probably piss myself.”“Fine. But do it as you’re running.”As in The Chosen series, the main character is a kick-ass strong, resilient, and snarky heroine who does not need saving does not take shit from anyone, and has a rather foul mouth when she’s pissed. This book also has the same mix of the serious plot but with funny and sometimes absurd bits of conversations and I went from being hot all over because of the sexual tension and smut to laughing out loud because of some silly interactions between Finley and other characters. Hadriel was a particularly funny secondary character and he made me smile and laugh more than once.I jumped. My pocketknife tumbled from my fingers. Fuck! I dropped the fucking knife.Hold on to your dicks, folks, this is about to get hairy.I find it funny how Finley talks to herself and to imaginary people when she’s in a dire situation. It’s as if she’s imagining a whole crowd with her and she’s talking to them whenever she’s feeling nervous or afraid, or when she’s under a lot of pressure.“You read too much.”“Is there such a thing?”Oh, and she’s also a bookworm, which gives her extra awesomeness points.She sounded like me, only surlier. I doubted my personality needed more salt, but here we were.Fuck nice. I have a dark and damning need for that alpha. I want to take a running leap, wrap my legs around his head, and force-feed him my pussy. This bitch needs some cock. Wham, bam, call me ma’am.Great goddess. What the hell kind of creature did I have inside of me?Things only get more interesting and even funnier once Finley finally gets in touch with her shifter side and can communicate with her very sarcastic and horny animal, while keeping on talking to her imaginary folks whenever she’s afraid… She had a whole party going on inside her head.Zombies better not be real, folks, or I’m going to have nightmares for the rest of my life.I’m getting concerned about who you think you are talking to, my animal thought, pumping power through me.Nyfain (aka The Beast) is one confusing man. He is hot and sexy, is obviously attracted to Finley, but pushes her away every time something happens or almost happens between them. He is in the middle of the curse and it seems that only he might have a chance at destroying it, but at the same time, we really don’t have much information about the curse so it all remains quite mysterious.So much for staying away from Nyfain. I just hoped the next meeting didn’t end up with my tit in his mouth.The angst and banter between Nyfain and Fin was super fun (but vulgar sometimes) to read, and the sexual tension between them was undeniable and soooooo good.Follow me on Instagram🙂
