I came across this book via Instagram and thought it sounded interesting. The cover wasn’t too shabby either.Stryker is one of those interesting gray heroes. He held his dying mother in his arms when he was 15 and promised to hunt down her killer. It’s many years later and while he’s still looking, he’s become a very powerful man. He owns a kink club. Interesting. He’s also founded a successful company which employees hackers who find ways to break into powerful companies and then work for the company to keep bad hackers out. But the most unusual service he performs is as a vigilante. He and a small team hunt down the worst of the worst bad guys and ‘take them out’.Our heroine is Emerson, a detective working on a serial murder case. Her boss has requested Stryker work with her but she and Stryker have a past. When she was new in her detective role, Emerson arrested him for running a prostitution ring out of his ‘club’. He was completely innocent but he holds a lot of animosity towards Emerson - as well as a stronger case of lust. For her part she feels guilty for her actions toward Stryker as well as also a strong case of lust.This is a fascinating story of two people working together to find a killer who are on opposite sides of the same goal. She puts the bad guys in jail and he makes sure they never commit another crime again. Both are very well written and this book is very steamy and quite dark at times. But I loved it and gladly recommend it. This is my first book by Stoni Alexander but I’m looking forward to reading more. It reminded me a bit of the In Death books by JD Robb and I do love that series. This one leans slightly more to the romance, which I appreciate.
