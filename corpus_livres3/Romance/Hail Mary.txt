“You don’t own me,”“Oh, but I do, cariño,”“And you own me, too.”3 starsLEO HERNANDEZ THE MAN THAT YOU ARE🧎🏻‍♀️🧎🏻‍♀️🧎🏻‍♀️this is the first book that I’ve read in the series and im not even mad about it. I was excited about this book for the longest so I tried to read the first book but I was so bored that I skipped all the other ones and jumped right into this one. I don’t think I missed much with skipping all the other ones.⤹⤷characters:╰┈➤→>LEO HERNÁNDEZ:🧎🏻‍♀️And when I took her hand in mine, the piece of me I’d been missing for years quietly snapped into place.Another man to add to my never ending list of book boyfriends.Leo is kind, gentle and would do anything for anyone who needs help. I love him so much 🥹Leo is a college football star who has a reputation for being a “playboy” off the field. But little do his teammates and the media know it’s all a facade. Leo is this way because of a girl who basically ghosted him when he was in high school and never heard from her again so he’s afraid to get close to anyone again.He likes the spotlight and believes the only way to get people’s attention and to stay on him is if he does reckless things on and off the field but believes no one really “knows” the real him except a girl he met online while playing video games years ago.╰┈➤→>MARY SILVER💉🩸I used to think I loved him. But that was before I hated him.I liked her as much as Leo. I love how she isn’t afraid to be who she is. She loves video games, drawing, and tattooing. I love how realistic her character was with showing her insecurities and how she admired her curves for being a plus sized woman.Growing up Mary truly never fit in and felt she didn’t fit into her family’s expectations. Her mother wanted a girl who she could dress up and her father wanted her to follow into his footsteps in business. Mary had other plans she didn’t go to college instead she wants to follow her dream and become a tattoo artist.⤹⤷THEIR RELATIONSHIP╰┈➤→>the past:Most of the time we laughed. Sometimes, we got so deep that I confessed things to him I never had to anyone else, and he did the same..When they were teenagers Mary was playing video games and was paired online with Leo. She knew who he was but he didn’t know her. They get close and share a special bond together sharing pieces of their lives with one another. One day Mary got the courage to speak to Leo in person at school and show him the drawing she was working on for him but she believed he didn’t like what he saw and his friends bullied her for having a crush on him and he did nothing about it.That same day Leo goes online to play video games with Mary only to find out she deleted him and blocked his number and basically “ghosted” him.╰┈➤→>the present:“I wish you remembered.”Mary lives in front of Leo and one day her place gets flooded so Leo offers her to stay with him and his other roommates for free. Mary is a struggling tattoo apprentice and doesn’t want to ask her parents for help so she eventually agrees.Mary absolutely hates him for what happened in the past (7 years ago) but Leo has no recollection of what he could’ve possibly done for Mary to hate him. He doesn’t recognize her at all since her appearance has changed from her teenage years.While living together Mary’s walls come down and they get close with each other. She eventually tells him the truth of who she really is and their relationship goes on from there.This man is the sweetest man ever! When Mary finally told him who she really was he hugged her like his life depended on it. He finally found the girl who he shared a real connection with when he was younger.But he was also falling for the present Mary so them being the same person he was happy.He begged her for a second chance to make it right, he constantly reassured her when she was feeling insecure, and he was always there to make things right and tell her he would never leave and make up for everything. 🥹If‘words of affirmation’were a person it’d be Leo Hernandez 🧎🏻‍♀️╰┈➤→>things I hated*spoilers ahead*1:when she told him who she was I was happy but it happened less than 200 pages in I knew there was a 3rd act breakup coming and I was dreading it.2:don’t get me wrong I loved Mary but I started hating her at some point. this man begged and begged and she still left. actually she does that a lot; she runs away, I get it’s her insecurities but how many times does this man have to prove himself over and over again until she figures out he’s sorry and isn’t going to leave.3:the tattoo shop Mary is working at her boss is a creep and she second guessed herself when she felt he was a creep and over and over again she blows it off like it was nothing and she was“reading to much into it.”4:third act breakup was so fucking stupid.*rant incoming*↴Her boss like I said above was definitely a creep. He promised her a chair in his shop and told her she could repay him“in some way”.He sexually assaulted her and she eventually knees him where’the sun doesn’t shine’but of course he decides to fire her because she didn’t want to sleep with him and tells her she isn’t cut out to be a tattoo artist.Mary goes home crying and tells Leo what happened and you know what he does? He goes and punches her ex boss and tells him if he ever looks at her again he’ll killl him. Mary gets mad because it’ll ruin her careerlike she didn’t get fired alreadyand that she’s handling it.She should’ve gone to the police right away tbh. But still gets mad a Leo for punching him.The following day she decides to pack her bags and says she’s going to stay with her parents. When Leo notices she’s leaving heFUCKING FALLS TO HIS KNEES AND BEGS HER TO STAY AND NOT TO LEAVE AND SHE STILL FUCKING LEFT🙄this is what he told her before she left. ↴“Can I hold you? Please?”“I’m sorry,” I told her. “I shouldn’t have gone last night. I was an idiot. I should have stayed with you, should have been here with you.” I shook my head, still holding onto her. “I didn’t think. I fucked up. But I swear I will do everything to make it up to you. Please,” I begged. “Stay.”After the breakup he facetimes her and she had the audacity to think‘He looked so good it hurt.’LIKE SHE DIDNT HURT HIM BY LEAVING. I was so mad at her, im still mad writing this.5:honestly after the 3rd act breakup I was so mad that I started skimming just to be done.6:some of the writing style and dialogue was kinda cringe.╰┈➤→> overalll 3 stars for Leo only 🤭—————have i read any of the other books in this series? no 🤭i tried with book one and hated it and this is the only one that catches my attention 🤷🏻‍♀️
