barely 2 stars🍭Here I will admit that yes, I saw a video on TikTok promoting ONE scene in this book & got sucked in like theweak bitchI am.QUICK NOTE:this review ismore negative than positive, so let me just unload the positives here. I think this isthe author’s first book, so I won’t sit here and criticise as if I do notsee potential here - I do.i became interested in a few of the characters & can see myself reading the second book in this series. The smutvaried.some scenes were GOOD, and some were ok.don't hold anything to me lol because like the aforementioned weak bitch I am, as soon as I read the happy, gushy & smutty end I began overlooking everything I didn’t like. lol but I am still sticking to my rating. the writing was good in some areas.SO LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THE REMY (the fmc)she was the biggest ‘pick me, choose me, love me’ fmc I’ve encountered so far (I think. Either way, she’s up there)A little background is that she’sa) tiny🥺 b) tells us how well she gets along with guys c) doesn’t really wear make-up or dress up like other girls <3& these quotes below are only SOME of the bullshit that came out her mouth:‘I look over at my sister. Sometimes I forget how ingrained I am in the guys’ testosterone-filled world- how much of a tomboy I really am. I dont even notice half the gross boy behaviour anymore. As close as she and Jax are, she’s too feminine to ever be as close to him and his world as I am.’Btw, this jax is her BOY BEST FRIENDwhom she couldneverbe in a relationship with because it’s “too weird”. Yet, their relationship IS KINDA ALREADY weird. Call me the jealous type but… they’re both straight, find each other good looking and overly comfortable with each other. ITS WEIRD. Plus he nicknames her “Remy baby”. shut up.also. (SPOILER): her sister and jax get together so this is remy being stupid.‘Haley looks girly no matter what she wears, whereas I look like a fit chick that would drop kick anyone that looks at me’OKAY??😭I know these quotes don’t make her a “bad person” or anything but its just so silly.‘Jax grunts his half-assed approval. I chuckle, knowing its the closest thing to a compliment that I’ll get from him in regard to my appearance. One of the things I know Jay has appreciated in our friendship all these years is that I’ve never rubbed in his face that I’m female. It’s also one of the things that’s helped me to exist in a male-dominated sport.’NAH. WHAT IS THIS?First things first, jax literally gawks &compliments remy when she dresses up later in the book so that thing is a fat lie.“i’ve never rubbed in his face that I’m female.”so what does this mean, chief?‘I don’t need his protection. I fight guys for fun, for God’s sake. I’m not the kind of girl that needs to be coddled.’‘I’m all for toning down the hooker outfits once a girl has a boyfriend.’I understand everyone has their own opinions but ur just chatting out your ass right now, remy baby.I haven’t mentioned the love interest yet lol.His name is Tristan. He’s actually pretty whatever - we don’t get his POV, so it’s hard to dissect him like Remy. Here’s a cringe quote for fun tho:“The difference is, I know for a fact that you like me being this close to you - that you’re actually soaked right now,” he purrs.🐯 purrOMG WAIT WAITTHIS QUOTE MADE ME LAUGH OUT LOUDRemy and Tristan are bonding and he asked her what her favourite book is and this is her response:“people don’t ask that question anymore. They don’t read. Or play chess. I feel like having academic interests just isn’t as normal anymore outside of an actual intellectual career.”Fair enough if people don’t read as they used to BUT SHE ACTS SO STARSTRUCK THAT HE ASKED WHAT HER FAVOURITE BOOK IS. how unusual is that considering she literally told him she wants to write books???DON'T GET ME WRONG.Remy did have other friends who she was very supportive & protective of. A lot of the annoying stuff was at the start of the book.moving on.what else Idid likeabout this book was that:It was prettysafe.there was a hot scene where they pretend to be together so Tristan's ex could go away. that was nice. i approved this.it kept me reading the whole way through. The spice could have been filthier for a hussy like me but it was good & pretty frequent.
