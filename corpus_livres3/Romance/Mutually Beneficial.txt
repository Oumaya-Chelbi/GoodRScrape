✰ 𝗿𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗱 ~ 𝟬𝟭/𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟮 (𝟯.𝟲 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘀) ✰Theo is the real MVP of this book, hands down. I cannot wait for his book, ngl.“I promise I will not go out and shoot up while you’re getting laid.”“Theo!” Her cheeks flooded with heat. “Excuse me. I promise I will not go out and partake of heroin while you’re holding hands and reading the bible with your beau.”I knocked my rating down a bit because I was not a fan of how Jason broke up with Annalise. She deserved more from him and she deserved a better apology. Also the romance in this developed rather abruptly, imo. I would have liked for it to have been explored a bit more.But yeah, I pretty much stand by my original review. I can't wait to see what book two has in store......ᴛʜʀᴇᴇ⋆⁷⁵// ꜰᴏᴜʀ ꜱᴛᴀʀꜱ✰❝Jason?❞❝Sorry, just thinking.❞❝Are you thinking about how much you want to make French toast?❞A small smile pulled at his lips.❝Is that a hint?❞♫ sᴏɴɢ ʀᴇᴄ ♫ ~Never Knew Love Like This Before (STEPHANIE MILLS)-ˏ͛⑅ᴍʏ ᴏᴠᴇʀᴀʟʟ ᴛʜᴏᴜɢʜᴛꜱ⑅ˏ͛-ᴀ ʙʀɪᴇꜰ ᴀꜱɪᴅᴇ ▸//▸Mutually Beneficialis kickstarting a new book category that i'm labeling -ᴊᴜʟɪᴀ'ꜱ ᴍɪᴅɴɪɢʜᴛ ʀᴇᴀᴅꜱ✨- basically, i started this book atmidnight(as one does) and ended upforgoing all my hours of sleepjust to finish this book. i do this a lot and i've finally decided to name the phenomena.Don't you guys justlovewhen you mindlessly pick up a book, go in withzero expectations, and then end up so utterly engrossed that you stay up half the night to finish it? It istrulyone of the greatest feelings in the world.I went into MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL expecting a knockoffBass-Ackwards,and left with literaltearsin my eyes. Gosh, my emotions were all over the place reading this one. The set up is pretty simple (and also seems ripped straight out of a cheesy porno), but as the story goes on I realized how muchheartJason and Annalise had.-ˏ͛⑅ᴀ ʙʀɪᴇꜰ ꜱʏɴᴏᴘꜱɪꜱ⑅ˏ͛-Annalise Teague is broke, broke,broke. Therefore, she has no money to pay rent on her apartment, so, what's a girl to do?Enter Jason.Jason is the big grumpy lumberjack looking man who happens to be her landlord. When he comes by asking for rent Annalise tells him,❝Please, I'll do anything.❞Thus, commences their mutually beneficial relationship. Anna and Jason will have sex every Saturday, in exchange Annalise will get live in her apartment rent free. However, what happens if Anna likes their arrangement? Moreover, what happens if Jason actually happens to be a good guy behind his gruff exterior?-ˏ͛⑅ᴡʜᴀᴛ ɪ ʟɪᴋᴇᴅ⑅ˏ͛-❝You know what would make it even better?❞He grinned.❝If you say ‘French toast’ I’ll—❞❝You’ll what?❞He nipped her shoulder and let her go.❝I’ll make you French toast.❞♥ᴊᴀꜱᴏɴ & ᴀɴɴᴀʟɪꜱᴇ♥Both main characters, Jason and Annalise, were fabulous main characters, Jason especially. I went into MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL not expecting much character wise, and left with the aforementioned tears in my eyes. Both Jason and Anna had heart wrenching backstories, but I have to say Jason really tugged at my heartstrings.~✨ᴊᴀꜱᴏɴ✨~When we first meet Jason he's. . . well he's quiet, gruff, and makes a harebrained proposition. However, once we get inside his head and Anna gets to know him outside of sex she - and us the readers - realize how multi-faceted Jason truly is. First, he's an Army Vet who struggles with PTSD and is still dealing with brain damaged he suffered from.In addition, we see through various "flashbacks" that he is still grappling with an abusive relationship he left five years prior. All of this to say, Jason is a complex well thought out individual. His struggles felt real, his bone deep kindness was beautiful to witness, and his insecurities were subtly woven into his character. I enjoyed seeing him not only open up to Annalise, but actually connect with her and recognize she was a safe place where he could be himself.~✨ᴀɴɴᴀʟɪꜱᴇ✨~On the other hand we have Annalise. She was a different character from Jason in that she appeared to - rent issue notwithstanding - to have her shit a bit more together. Yet, one of the most enjoyable parts of MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL was witnessing Annalise, not come apart, but lower her guard towards Jason. She is a fixer, a doer, a mother hen, if you will. Since her parents have died its been on her to not only take care of herself, but also take care of her older brother. Anna selflessly takes care of her older brother and is doing everything in her power to get him clean. However, the question that comes to our minds - and Jason - is this,who takes care of Annalise?Once again, enter Jason.MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL displays Annalise's strength, courage, and sweetness. She's an interesting individual and she truly earned her HEA with Jason. While Jason had the more compelling story - IMO - Anna had a subtler story. Her journey over the course of this book was more subtle. We subtlety see her realize that it's okay to allow yourself moments of vulnerability. Through, Annalise we see that it's okay to let someone else take care of you. And through Annalise we witness what unconditional love looks like.♥ᴛʜᴇ ʀᴏᴍᴀɴᴄᴇ♥Ireallyliked the romance in MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL. Not only did it start out with quite the bang, but I positivelylovedhow it progressed. Jason and Annalise start with their "mutually beneficial" arraignment and slowly over the course of the book it shifts into something more. I'd say my favorite aspect of the romance was the way in which Jason and Annalise were justtherefor each other.~✨ꜰᴏʀ ᴇxᴀᴍᴘʟᴇ✨~one of my favorite scenes in the book is this scene -❝Because you don’t like crowds? Or strangers? Or whatever your trigger is? Jason, that’s so common, it’s almost boring.❞A small thread of affront managed to weave through all the self-loathing.❝Boring?❞❝Yeah. Anxiety? Come on. Amateur hour. You can’t call yourself a headcase unless you’re killing neighborhood cats and keeping their bodies nailed to your garage wall.❞❝That’s… a really high bar.”Not only does the above scene demonstrate the banter between Jason and Annalise, but it shows just how well Annalise reads Jason. First, she knows that he's probably embarrassed that she just saw him having a panic attack. Second, she's using humor to diffuse the situation because she knows he needs some lightness injected into the moment. Lastly, she's not only trying to make him feel better, but is also telling him that she likes//loves him "flaws" and all. To me the above moment really encapsulates why these two work so well together.~✨ᴀᴅᴅɪᴛɪᴏɴᴀʟʟʏ✨~I loved the obvious affection they both had for one another. I think a lot of times inromancelandiamany of the couples seem to. . .not really like each other? Or at least everything between said couple is appears sodifficult. Every now and then it's truly refreshing to see a couple who genuinely love to spend time together and see so sweetly adore one another.❝I love you, Annalise. I loved you the moment I met you. You’re kind and giving and too good for me—❞She stopped him with a finger against his lips.❝Do I deserve whatever I want?❞❝That and more,❞he said, earnest.❝I want you. So you’re not too good for me—you’re exactly what I deserve. One day you’ll believe it,❞Anna whispered.Jason secretly pines for Annalise and sees her a his calm in the storm. Annalise straight upadoresJason and sees him as her big protector. There was something just so sweet about their burgeoning romance. I wanted to protect it all costs.✿ᴛʜᴇᴏ✿Not even gonna lie, I amhopingandprayingthatOld Habitsis all about Theo, Annalise's brother. Firstly, he so deserves a wonderful happily ever after, and secondly, he was such a great character. We get enough backstory about him to be intrigued and we get to see a glimpse of the struggles he's going through. However, what made Theo such an interesting character was even at his lowest we can see that he truly cares for his sister. The bond Theo and Annalise have is so beautiful. The way Annalise never gives up on Theo was so inspiring and felt so real. Likewise, what Theo does for Annalise at the end seriously rings true. Their bond was strong and I'm glad the author went out her way to actually develop it. Also, due to having a real life brother of my own I happen to have a true soft spot for brother-sister relationships in my stories (the platonic non-stepbrother kind of course).Additionally, I really liked the friendship he started with Jason. Not only was it actually really sweet, but they happen get alongreallywell. The friendship didn't feel forced at all and it also allowed us to see another side to both Jason and Theo. They have this grumpy-grumpy // awkward dynamic that I just love. I'm really hoping we get more Jason x Theo moments in his potential book. What can I say, I'm a huge sucker for a great well written bromance.-ˏ͛⑅ᴡʜᴀᴛ ɪ ᴅɪᴅɴ'ᴛ ʟɪᴋᴇ⑅ˏ͛-☁×°ᴛʜᴇ ᴍɪꜱᴄᴏᴍᴍᴜɴɪᴄᴀᴛɪᴏɴ°×☁*sigh* and we were doing so well. . . what is a romance without a9th hour breakup?I'm sure I'm not alone when I say this, buuuuut the miscommunication trope is one of my least favorites. What usually makes said trope so frustrating is the fact thatusuallywhen it rears its ugly head it feelsso out of place. And that's exactly what happened here. See, for almost the entire book Jason and Annalise have had pretty good communication skills. That's basically how they were able to transition their relationship into what it became. However, suddenly by the end of the book Jason is deciding they need to break up. . .because reasons. *sigh*~✨ᴛʜᴇ ᴡʜʏ ᴏꜰ ɪᴛ ᴀʟʟ✨~really annoyed me. So, the grand reason Jason decides to breakup with Annalise is becauseof their "mutually beneficial" relationship. Now mind you at this point in the book they were actually together together. Thus, he's retroactively breaking up with her because. . . he feelsbad?? I - *sighs* Jason, my man,don't be sorry bebetter.~✨ᴛʜɪꜱ ʙᴜɢɢᴇᴅ ᴍᴇ ʙᴇᴄᴀᴜꜱᴇ✨~it seemed so out of left field. Like, I thought they had talked everything out? I thought they were good. And look, I get it, her fucking him in exchange for free rent because all her extra money is being put towards her brothers rehab stay is. . .not a great look on his part. HOWEVER, they had already talked about everything. Plus, and this is a big one, Annaliseneverfelt bad about their arrangement. Thus, for a couple who talked outmuchharder issues you'd think Jason would share his insecurities // uncertainties. But, alas. This breakup seemed to happen for dramas sake and that's it. Therefore, I found it unnecessary, annoying, and very out of character for Jason.☁×°ᴊᴜꜱᴛ ᴀ ʙɪᴛ ᴍᴏʀᴇ°×☁My last point is less a complaint and more a general. . .feeling. See, I really really liked this book. In fact, I think it had the potential to be a five star read, with some tweaks. What kept MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL from beingmind-blowingwas this elusivething. I've thought about it and thought about it and I think I know what it is. I wanted just abitmore from Jason and Annalise as characters. Jason especially had a whole host of issues that I felt we only scratched the surface of. From his PTSD, to his survivors guilt, to the brain damage he suffered, from holding in the pain of his past abusive relationship. There wasa lotgoing on with Jason. Thus, when the book ended I personally felt there was more to explore.Additionally, I wanted to know more about Annalise. A lot of this book seemed more focused on Jason's issues and while that's understandable I felt like Anna's pain got a touch glossed over. Our heroine was going through it and taking life's challenges like a champ. Moreover, it seemed like she had a lot inner turmoil that she wasjust nowdealing with.Ultimately, I think it comes down to the books length. Now, as I've said anytime I touch on this point, I'm not an author. I don't know how an author decides how long/short a book will be. BUT, sometimes I read certain stories and justknowif they had been a touch longer things could've truly "come together." Personally, I think that's what happened here. I think if the book were a touch longer the things raised in MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL could've been further addressed. Orrrr, it could just be that I'm a greedy bish and wantedallthe chapters ;))-ˏ͛⑅ɪɴ ᴄᴏɴᴄʟᴜꜱɪᴏɴ. . .⑅ˏ͛-MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL ended up being a real surprise hit for me. I went in expecting. . .not much, okay if i'm being honest I was expecting meaningless smut that I'd most likely DNF @20%. Instead, new-to-me authorAva Guerreserved me a delicious, somewhat taboo, landlord-with-benefits romance. Jason and Annalise ended up being really deep and realistic characters that I couldn't help but root for. Jason especially surprised me with his insecurities, pain, and capacity to care // love Annalise.Ultimately, I highly recommend MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL. If you're looking for a turned down version of BASS-ACKWARDS, or just like the "i'll-sex-you-up-in-exchange-for-free-rent" trope then this is the book for you. Moreover, I'm really hoping that book two stars Annalise's brother, Theo. He truly deserves his HEA and I can't wait to see what journey AVA GUERRE takes him on.
