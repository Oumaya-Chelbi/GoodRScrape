This was a surprise and I really enjoyed every page of it.A very good story with a nice amount of angst but with a hero I loved.The age gap is not significant at all, because the heroine is 22 and the hero 33 but she’s got a 2 yo daughter while he’s never been in a relationship so it’s not as if she was a virgin grown up in a convent while he was a widow with children.The hero in the beginning seems to be a womanizer because when he meets the heroine the woman he spent the night before with turns up and the heroine freezes. But it’s true that as soon as he sees the heroine he’s besotted and tries to persuade her to date him.He even deletes all ow numbers and messages from his phone- and they have not been together yet.He’s really cute.Then come ow.And the real angsty part of the book.Because the matter is, can a woman and a man be only friends???The hero obviously think they can, because there’s this woman he considers like a lil sister, who he basically saved from an abusive ex, while the woman has obviously been in love with him all the time.And she creates havoc. She’s mean to the heroine, she’s jealous and the hero doesn’t believe she can be in love with him because he was never interested in her as a woman.He treats her as he would a male friend.And can’t understand why the heroine doesn’t trust him.He is of course very protective of his female friend and can’t see that she wants more from him until it’s too late.The heroine has great trust issues because she grew up without a a father, had a cheating boyfriend and her only sexual experience was a drunken ons with a stranger in a bar, that rejected her when she told him she was pregnant.So all the men in her life were total disappointments and when she sees that ow has feelings for the hero and he refuses to change his relationship with her, she feels betrayed and rejected once again.Thank god this hero is a good and besotted man who sadly has a very low iq, but when he understands ow is obsessed by him he immediately rejects her and throws her out of his life.After some more drama they can be happy- eventually.I liked how this author deals with feelings and is able to make an angsty story without abuse and cheating, only with some evil characters and some good old misunderstandings.So totally safe for me.The hero is completely besotted with the heroine and with her lil girl, he’s truly a sexy and honest guy and his love for the heroine is never under discussion.The heroine is young and had a nasty experience with the only one man she hooked up, but she’s strong and caring. She’s also smart and has a nice and satisfying job.They make a very good couple.I really appreciated this new author and I hope she will write other books because I like her style. And of course next book will be about the heroine’s friend Penny!After many disappointing stories this one is a palate cleanser that I loved to read and I will surely reread!
