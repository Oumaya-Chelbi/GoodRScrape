જ⁀➴4✰⋆𐙚₊˚⊹“We’re all broken in some way. But we can also be fixed”⋆𐙚₊˚⊹ᯓᡣ𐭩storyKade & stacey became each other obsession at 15; got together and fell in love at 18, unfortunately something happened between them that caused them to break up and made some wrong decisions going forward with their life. Now they don’t think they deserve to have a happy ending.ᯓᡣ𐭩my thoughtsI ATE THIS UP, it’s been a while since I’ve read a book in less than 24 hours, but this one was soo addictive. This book is originally from Wattpad so you can expect it to have that kind of writing in which it’s easier to read because it wasn’t complicated to understand and didn’t had any different dialect.If you like dark romance I do recommend you this book, it was fast paced enough to keep me entertained and intrigued.The story is told in two times: the present; in which they hate each other and the past through flashbacks. Those flashbacks were the cutest, you can really see that they loved and cared so much for each other while reading them.check triggers warning before reading itᯓᡣ𐭩characters˚₊ · »-♡→kade🚬🕷.ᐟ “I’ve struggled with emotions since I was a kid. I felt alive for the first time when I had Stacey”an obsessive psychotic, he can’t stop thinking about Stacey and even when he was far away he stalked her because the sole reason of not knowing what she’s doing makes him crazy. He loved her so much, she was the one who showed him that he has emotions and that he’s not like his father.Being inside his mind was so interesting and I’m glad that a lot of chapters were from his pov, we can see how he struggled with feelings when he was younger and how he started to accept the love that Stacey gave him.˚₊ · »-♡→stacey🩰🕷.ᐟ “I’m stuck trying to find my strength and voice”the things that happened to Stacey💔 she’s a character that’s always hiding what she is been through, none of her friends knows what happens in her house and she doesn’t trust anyone to help her since her own father didn’t believed her. I love her, I wished I could give her a hug.˚₊· ͟͟͞͞➳❥˚✿ °.Stacey & Kade🕷.ᐟ “We had everything, and now we have nothing but lies and grudges”My heart breaks for them, I loved how they were both inexperienced and did everything for the first time together, kissing, cuddling, learning about emotions. It was just so beautiful. Their little moments together gave me life.The line between them is so blurred once they meet again after 2 years without seeing each other. Their hearts still feels love for the other but their mind and all the grudges they have doesn’t let them be happy.I can’t say too much without spoiling but I really love them😭The things that both of them went through in this book hits different for me now because I literally just came out of a class in which my professor told us about her work, she is an attorney that works with abused people and listening to her made me realize that a lot of people go through that in real life and idk, I read so I can escape reality but sadly the topics that this book explores are reality for a lot of people.ᯓᡣ𐭩other characters:𐙚 I NEED A BOOK ABOUT BASE AND LUCIELLA, I’m so invested in them, also Tylar and Dez, their crumbs weren’t enough.𐙚 I know that Kade parents are going to get a book but I don’t think I’m willing to read it because his mother is already married and in a health relationship and the romance between his mom and dad is so toxic.after reading the trilogy I fear I NEED their book, I completely changed my opinion of them🫸🏻𐙚 I seriously need Kade to discover what Stacey brother is doing to her and take action, because it makes me sick whenever he appears.🎧ྀིKade & Stacey mini playlistᰔ⤷ spiracle ⟡ flower face⤷ from now on ⟡ the greatest showman⤷ do i wanna know ⟡ arctic monkey⤷ maniac ⟡ conan gray⤷ youngblood ⟡ 5sos⤷ die with a smile ⟡ bruno mars & lady gaga⤷ broken ⟡ lovelytheband⤷ the hills⟡ the weekend⤷ 21 ⟡ gracie abrams⤷ where’s my love ⟡ syml⤷ you broke me first ⟡ tate mcrae⤷ feel something ⟡ jaymes young⤷ remember than night ⟡ sara kays💌tropes:ꨄ︎ second chanceꨄ︎ enemies to loversꨄ︎ secret relationshipꨄ︎ it’s always been youꨄ︎ best friend’s brotherꨄ︎ touch her and die-‘๑’-some of my favorite quotes-‘๑’-・❥・“We’re a perfect fit – two puzzle pieces with tattered edges”・❥・“Staying silent is like being in a mental prison.”・❥・“I fit against him like the perfect puzzle piece.

The mentally fucked-up kid. A boy who struggled with basic emotions.But whenever I’m around her, I want to learn everything there is to feel. I want to be good enough for her”・❥・“I was fifteen when I met her, and that’s when my obsession began”・❥・“Since the moment I picked her up from that house, I’ve felt less dead inside. A speck of light in my darkness with her name on it”・❥・“We were in love. We had a future, and we were going to make Luciella understand what we meant to each other. No one could come between us. Ever.Then someone did”・❥・“I can feel her smile against my mouth.And then… butterflies. I have fucking butterflies while kissing someone. What the fuck is wrong with me?”・❥・“Losing your voice to everyone is one thing, but losing your voice to someone you loved – trusted – is ten million times worse”・❥・“I handed that boy my heart when I was a teen, and even now, years later, he still holds it”・❥・“She’s the girl I watch, the girl I obsess over until I feel like I’m going fucking insane. I gave her my heart when I was a teenager, and do you know what she did? She shattered it”side note: the book has a lot of OW/OM drama but when you read it you understand why it’s in the book, and there’s miscommunication too (the whole book is based in that) but it’s the type that makes sense and I can’t really blame the characters for not speaking up.ᝰ.ᐟpre-read:ᯓᡣ𐭩This trilogy has been living on my fyp lately, I got too curious so I had to start it✨
