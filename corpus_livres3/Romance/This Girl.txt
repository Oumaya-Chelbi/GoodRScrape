This review is very longSo long, in fact, that your attention spanMay be stretched to its very limitsBut that’s okay.This GirlThis coupleAnd their Love Story........took my breath away!!!----------------------------------------------------------Hello Readers,So what do I tell you aboutthis book?Well, let me start with a story....A girl once moved into a new town, far, far away from where she used to live.Along with her were her mother and her little brother.This girlwas tough.Resilient.Though she had lost her mentor, her guide, her hero, all wrapped up in one and only.... her father, she moved onwith all her strength wrapped up in a smile.This girl was Layken.And then she met with the boy-next-door who lived with his young brother.This boywas tall, polite, and just plain hot.This boy was Will.And thenthis boysweptthis girloff her feet.He asked her out on a date to begintheirstory.Hmmm...but don't they always? Seemed like the Princess got her Prince Charming.And what would happen next, was really not very difficult to guess.Did you then? Guess...I mean.Well I couldn't.Because what happened next wassurprising,amazing,breathtaking,powerful,raw,stunning, and the rest was..........butterflying history.--------------------------------------------------------But it was stillincomplete.I still hungered for more.I couldn't really pinpoint it, but something was missing.And that something was Will's thoughts, his feelings, his hopes, his fears about....this girl.Readers, this book is a wonderful collage.A collage of memories present and past.---------------------------------------------------Their honeymoon--IF I TOOK every romantic poem, every book, every song, and every movie I’ve ever read, heard, or seen and extracted the breathtaking moments, somehow bottling them up, they would pale in comparison to this moment.This moment is incomparable.-----------------------------------------------------From this point on I’ll be able to do that for her.Should there be any more burdens I’ll be able to carry them for her. It’s all I’ve ever wanted to do forthis girl since the moment I first laid eyes on her.------------------------------------------------------His break-up with Vaughn--“Will, don’t,” she pleads. “Please don’t be mad at me.” She’s looking up at me with tears in her eyes. When she cries, her eyes turn a glossy, deep shade of blue.I used to tell her they were the exact same color as theocean. Looking into her eyes right now almost makes me despise the ocean.------------------------------------------------------First meeting with Layken--Wow. Those eyes. They’re the most incredible shade of green I’ve ever seen. I try to compare the color to something, but nothing comes to mind. It’s so unique, it’s like her eyes have just invented their own hue.This girl became his Lake.So youkeepyourocean,I’lltake theLake.----------------------------------------------------------Their first date--“And what’s a slam?”I pause for a second and smile at her. “It’s poetry,” I say. “It’s what I’m all about.” I wait for the laughter, but it doesn’t come.And then came his whole life, condensed into a one-minute poem.Death. The only thing inevitable inlife.But even after he laid his life bare for her to see....When I look into her eyes, it’s not pity I see at all.She’s still looking at me with hope in her eyes.This girl just became privy to everything I’ve been scared to tell her about my life. The death of my parents, the anger I held toward them, the amount of responsibility I now face, the fact that I’m all Caulder has—and she’s still looking at me with hope in her tear-filled eyes.Yes, this girl, this girl changed his life.But...we already know, the real challenges came after that.The greatest of hurdles came after that.So listen asthis boyrecounts tothis girl.....theirstory.I dreamt about this girl last night.Wow.Thisgirl.In mydreamI was standing on the edge of acliffLookingdownover avast, barren valley belowI wasn’t wearing anyshoesand the rocks werecrumblingbeneath mytoes.It would have been soeasyto take a step back,Tomoveaway from theledge,Away from acertain inevitable lifethat hadsomehowbeendeterminedfor meA life that hadsomehowbecome my only option.It had been my life fortwo yearsand I accepted that.I had notembracedit,But I hadacceptedit.It was where I belonged.As much as it didn’tappealto me, as much as Iyearnedfor theriversandmountainsandtrees,As much as Iyearnedto hear theirsongs. . .To hear their . . .poetry?It was apparent that whatIyearned forwasn’tdecidedby me . . .it was decidedforme.So . . .
