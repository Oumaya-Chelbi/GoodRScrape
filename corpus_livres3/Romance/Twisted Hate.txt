5 starsReading this book again and again gives me nostalgia, and I love all the feelings I get while reading this book!There's something about this book that always makes me happy while reading it💗Josh Chen and Jules Ambrose stole a piece of my heart when I started reading books, and they have had it since then!😭 Also, the fact that I read this book for the 3rd time and this time with music - THE EXPERIENCE WAS AMAZING! ✨I don't know what type of drug Ana was high on while writing this one, but I need that for future books! In a world full of billionaires, I would like to read about a cocky doctor (or a grumpy bodyguard, please). 🤝🏻╰┈➤ JULES 'redheaded menace' AMBROSE:💋She gives off 'If money can't buy happiness, then give me yours' vibes, and that's the standard! ✨It's super hard to find a confident, sexy, savage, and funny character who is not annoying at all or a pick-me. 😐 I swear the number of pick-me FMCs I've read is insane! She knew she was hot and had a sexy-as-sin body, and she dressed up how she wanted without giving two fucks about what others think! I'm glad that not one twisted girl is a pick-me and owns up to what they like, and Jules was full of flaws. Not once did she blame anyone for what happened but herself! She had full control over her own life and made each and every decision to survive,which I can say IS A LOT. Considering I don't even know what I want to study yet??!She's the strongest and has faced a lot in her life without losing her strength, fire, and courage, and she deserves each and every good thing happening to her."I didn’t believe in false humility—I knew I looked good."— Yes, QUEEN! 💗👑"Pretty exteriors hiding deadly poison which, in Jules’s case, came in the form of her viperous tongue."— That's why she's the savage one! 🔥I waited until our faces were only inches apart before I swerved abruptly and kissed a startled Marshall instead.— I would literally kill just to get Josh's POV on this exact scene! 🥺╰┈➤ JOSH 'devil's spawn' CHEN:🩺I do not fucking care if he's not a billionaire, stalker, or whatever; I LOVE HIM.The amount of comments I've seen of people kinda having a turn-off because he's NOT LIKE OTHER twisted men is insane! 😑He's the best twisted man ever! Well, I mean HIM AND RHYS ARE THE TOP! 😂 But I love him the same! The man was full of flaws, life, and feelings that I can't help but love him. I hated him while loving him.He's stupid and the biggest idiot ever, but so what? That's what a normal human is!NOT EVERYONE HAS AN IQ OF 160.😒The more I read this book, the more I imagine Josh better! His aesthetics are just so cute! 😗 And he's freaking hilarious in his comebacks and sans his emotional health in this book - he was pretty nice. He was super judgy, but at least he gets remorseful lmao!If I have to rate who's the best between Josh and Jules, IT'LL OBVIOUSLY BE JULES, but as her man, Josh gets some points! 🤷🏻‍♀️ HE GOT THE BEST.As you know, JULES IS THE QUEEN. Josh is a drama queen! I can't believe the number of times he had created chaos out of small situations!THE BIGGEST ONE IS CHRISTIAN-ALEX'S FRIENDSHIP. 😂“On a scale of one to ten, how badly do you want to fuck me right now?”- 11/10 🥹“Sweetheart, in a few minutes, you’ll forget your own name.”- His dirty talking had no boundaries! 🥵🫠➺Josh is the biggest romantic, I'm telling y'all...✨ Gave her a massage when she was having super painful period cramps✨ Noticed small details about her even though he hates her."I noticed everything about her, whether I wanted to or not."- but don't you hate her.....✨ Taught her how to ski without making fun of her!And that's super impossible for him.🤷🏻‍♀️✨"Disrespect Jules again, and I’ll put you in the emergency room myself.”- Threatened his co-worker because he disrespected Jules!✨ Left his trip to New Zealand and went to Ohio just to comfort her. 😩✨ Arranged a bookstore date for her because she loves books! 💗✨ Beat the fuck out of Max because he pushed Jules down the stairs! 😗🥺If these are the bare minimum, then I don't mind at all because I don't live inDELULU!😗➤IT WAS PERFECT ENEMIES-TO-LOVERS AND THE SEX WAS JUST TOO HOT.They didn't just fall in love with each other! There was lust... and lust, A LOT OF LUST, with a huge amount of sexual tension, and then they both exploded and had sex like animals 🤧I swear their first sex scene was full of hate, anger, and passion, and it was super hot. I was choking, gripping the sheets, and TOPPED IT OFF WITH "WRONG" BY ZAYN 🤤🔥They got into aFriends-with-benefits arrangement and still had sex, again and again! THE HOTTEST BOOK? IT'S THIS ONE! 🥵"Tell me why I can't stop thinking about you. Hmm? What the fuck did you do to me?"— For fucks sake, that 'hmm' did something inside of me! 😭 And when he spanked and choked her before this.... *swoon*.His hand closed around my throat, and he squeezed. Harder and harder, until darkness edged my vision and I couldn't take it anymore. I opened my mouth to gasp for air, managing to drag in one breath before he shoved his cock in.— I remember when I read this book for the first time, being shocked when he did this! 🤭Their sex scenes were anything but sweet, and like a greedy little sucker for them, I DEVOURED IT! 😉➤ The third act conflict was stupid as fuck, and Max was a bitch...🤬I was cheering when Jules took Christian's helpwho couldn't say no because of Stellawho made Jules sign a contract of owing him a favor, andSHE STOLE THE SEX TAPE MAX HAD OF HER AND REMOVED ALL THOSE EVIDENCES! 🤝🏻I was glad she went to Josh and didn't drag this out for a long time for him to find out from someone else, and she told him the truth...➤ Ok, Josh... full of flaws... Josh was being a stupid ass! I mean A LOT of stupid ass, like his head was stuck in his ass!💀 He yelled at her, and it wasn't just yelling; it was downright degrading, which might cause the worst form of mental and emotional trauma. His words were like a knife tomyJules' heart! 💔Before y'all come, I did not like his behavior at all, okay? And Jules did not deserve what happened either!- Josh could've treated her nicely or at least be mad at her, but he said much worse things ever, and that was soul-crushing at best. I hated him in that scene, but that doesn't mean he's not worthy of forgiveness because he's, after all, human and has his own traumas and fears!He lacks trust, and everyone in his life betrayed him—his father, his friend—but still, he finally managed to trust Jules only to get betrayed by her too! She had her reasons and came clean, but Jules' betrayal was just the end of everything! HE SNAPPED.He felt remorseful for his behavior and did his fair share of groveling!THOUGH SOME MORE WOULDN'T HURT.But whatever, we still got it. AND IF YOU SAY IT'S FICTIONAL AND BLAH BLAH then shut up because no one wants to read a book full of sweet, nice things without angst, lmao, because I personally don't!➤BEFORE Y'ALL COME AT JOSH, BACK TF OFF 🔪🔪🔪.-ALEX lied to Ava, betrayed her, and said worse things to her too! HE'S A BILLIONAIRE AND SPENT 1 YEAR AT GROVELING!!!so what? I don't fucking care. 🙁-Rhys is cute! Rhys is nice! 💗-Christian stalked Stella despite knowing she fears stalkers and lied to her.-Dante used Vivian just to take revenge on her father.BUT THEY ARE ALL FORGIVEN BECAUSE WHY?? They're freaking billionaires.I'm happy with Josh. No hate to others, though because I love them toonot you Alex, but I just wanted to prove a point....“Did yours? (Opinion changed) Because until we started having sex, you treated me the same as you did in college.”— I'm glad Jules fucking pointed that out to him! Josh judged Jules as he did in the other books, that she's a bad influence, andJules always had suffered from judgment because of her looks, and Josh did the same at the start! Thus making them both hate each other to the core! THOUGH I'M GLAD JOSH WAS REMORSEFUL FOR WHAT HE SAID, but he was right, opinions do change!And what I loved the most is how Jules did not let him get the upper hand ever! She's a baddie! 💪🏻“We got caught in this cycle of insulting and hating each other, and I didn't know how to break it.”— and before their awfully amazing sex, they didn't know why! And they always insulted each other because it was like muscle memory! 😂 Though I must say the banter was hilarious and my favorite! 🤭“It’s not. Even if I didn’t mean for you to hear it, you did. I hurt you, and I’m sorry.”— cutie!My heart pounded out a hard, territorial rhythm with each step. Mine. Mine. Mine.— caveman! 🤭“You’re my personal hell, Red. And God help me, I don’t want to fucking leave.”— Lmaoo, I remember seeing a meme in which Alex was saying that JOSH SOUNDS LIKE A MASOCHIST! 💀🤣JOSH CHEN:❝ Red, you’ll fall in love with me before I ever fall in love with you. ❞ALSO, JOSH CHEN:❝ You’re mine,” I said against her mouth. “Let another man touch you, Jules, and you’ll find out just how easily I can take a man’s life as I can save one. ❞— ALSO, please, the main part from 'one more hour by tame impala' evokes some kind of feels inside me while reading twisted hate that it's like escaping from this universe and going into a new one! 😩✨ and it's own playlist is so good!Imma walk away... this review was much needed for my sanity! 🚶Ratings.𖥔 ݁ ˖Twisted Love(Ava & Alex) – 2 starsTwisted Games(Bridget & Rhys) – 5 starsTwisted Lies(Stella & Christian) – 3 stars
