5, 10 or more stars!This is such an amazing book but it is not for everyone.And Vicious... this heartless and hateful bastard... he is not a hero for everyone...How can I warn you... how can I explain?Well, think of an as*hole character you have read in romance books.Now multiply it with 10...That’s him! That’s Baron Spenser, aka Vicious (a very well earned nickname). He can easily win this year's biggest as*hole award...He will drive you crazy with what he does and thanks to dual point of view, you will see how vicious his inner thoughts are as well as his actions. I’d never seen such a character in any book. The author has done an amazing job of portraying a unique as*hole character.Vicious... He really is something else!Does he have reasons to be so cruel?Yes, you gradually learn why he is the way he is ...You learn why he acts in that ruthless and indifferent manner, hating everyone and even his own life.Does he redeem himself later on?Oh, yessssssss.....Very much so?Yessssss, definitely...But not in a cheesy way. No cheese fest here, thank God.Also, not by suddenly turning into a “flowers & hearts” guy!He redeems himself in his own unique way... in a way that suits him... in a way that melted me :)Is he still an as*hole at the end of the book?Ha ha, yes, but just a funnier and sexier one later, not in the hateful and heartless way he was at the beginning! But even when he was heartless, the way he reasoned, I mean his rationale, oh you must read it, it was unbelievable! Still funny when he was cruel. I was so often screaming at home by myself! Yelling at him, cursing, swearing, but all the while also pitying...Later in the second half, I was sighing, swooning, sweating, melting and all the while still swearing at his crude behavior and vicious ways that he cannot help :)! He is not named Vicious for no reason. He earns it! He can't be a saint all all of a sudden, right? :)Am I a fan of as*hole heroes?Oh, no... Normally, I hate as*hole heroes and always give a big rant about them in my reviews.The weird thing is I loved Vicious and I loved him even at his worst, not after he redeemed himself. I loved the book both “in spite of him” and “because of him”...Vicious has his own way of telling events and explaining his actions in his chapters and immediately, I got hooked... spellbound... dumbfounded.. Not believing my eyes about what I was reading... How he thinks and acts would drive even a saint crazy!But you know, there is a thin line between love and hate, between the good and the bad, or justice and injustice and the book makes us question them all.This book was an unforgettable journey, and I enjoyed every bit of it. You go back from past (10 years ago) to present and a glimpse of past with a glimpse of present go hand in hand.My book is full of highlights, the sad ones, funny ones, frustrating ones, emotional ones and the hot ones... Every page... every sentence in the book is precious, worth reading and saving somewhere in your heart or brain...With its high angst, unbelievable chemistry and very well-built sexual tension as well as a never-ending roller coaster of events and emotions, the book leaves you breathless and puts your heart in a series of palpitations while your body suffers from the vicious heat wave (pun intended)...The tension never drops, it gets more and more exciting... It is such an unforgettable reading experience...When the book ended, all I wanted was to rewind it and re-read it... I didn’t want to part my way from these people. Thank God, it is a series and we will see these characters in other books, at least as side characters :)The plot in short:Baron Spenser, aka Vicious or Vic, is one of the HotHoles of All Saints High School. These four hot and rich guys kind of rule the school and dominate the whole town. They give crazy parties, fuck around with every girl, smoke weed, get drunk and behave cruelly to nearly everyone else. What is good about them? Umm, hard to say at the beginning! They are being jerks all the time!Vicious lives with his father and step-mother. His mother died when he was a child.Emilia, Millie, or Help as our hero calls her (yes, seriously, for like 60% of the book, he calls her “Help”) is the daughter of the new servants in the Spensers’ Mansion. She is poor and low class when compared to these spoiled brats. However, she is beautiful, sexy, innocent and she has a pure good heart. She is also a skillful artist who paints pictures. She has an obsession with the cherry blossom tree and she has the same color hair.Emilia is bullied and humiliated by Vicious... for many reasons! She is hurt, threatened and ruined by him ...many times! It is difficult to bear, really.But do not think that Emilia is a doormat. She is not. She doesn’t take his shit most of the time. But this drives him even more insane. And when she is helpless and relents, it is only when she has to protect her parents and sick sister, with whose safety he threatens her.Of course, she makes mistakes, both when she was a teenager and an adult. The constant cruelty of Vicious despite the insane attraction between them sometimes leads Emilia to wrong decisions that she will later regret.Love triangle alertThe hate/love story of Emilia and Vicious also involves one other member of the HotHoles of Saint High School: Dean. So, their already complicated relationship turns into an even more complex, dangerous and hurtful triangle.Although they were incredibly compatible in most ways, Emilia and Vicious were also direct opposites of one another in many other ways. He was her BLACK whereas she was his PINK…“We were never close.”“Pink and Black were.”How could all this mess make a good book?This is where the talent of the writer speaks for itself. The amazing story telling of both characters make it a mind-blowing book. The way it is told is so impressive that you are hooked on even from the very first page.The characters are developed and they have many layers. All through the book, you discover a new thing on each page. The book keeps your constant attention. It is a breathless reading experience.Do I recommend it?Yes… but with some hesitation!If you can handle a really cruel hero for a while, you will be rewarded with an awesome reading experience, that is for sure.It somehow worked for me. I saw him... really really saw him. I saw how his so-called hatred was his obsession about her that he couldn’t accept even to himself. Stealing and keeping the pencils she chewed but giving her a hell of a time! Oh boy, he was pathetic.He was so hateful and monstrous that this pure beautiful creature seemed to be something he could never deserve to have so he wanted to taint her, torture her, all the while torturing himself along with her.I know these things are so personal and everyone’s triggers and hard limits are different. So please feel free to ask me about any of your worries that you think may ruin this experience for you and I will try to answer gladly :)And if you wanna see how vicious he is, here you are... But besidethe bad and the evil, I will also give you a glimpse of the beauty in it so that you can see it is not a simple dirty story of a bad boy. It is deep. It is intense. It is beautiful. And it is a quality work!In Japanese culture, the significance of the cherry blossom tree dates back hundreds of years. The cherry blossom represents the fragility and magnificence of life. It’s a reminder of how beautiful life is, almost overwhelmingly so, but that it is also heartbreakingly short.As are relationships. Be wise. Let your heart lead the way. And when you find someone who’s worth it—never let them go.For a fraction of a second, we were together, and it had felt divine. Not nice. Not safe. Not taken for granted. It was short and beautiful and painfully memorable. Like the tree I was obsessed with.***My grandma once told me that love and hate are the same feelings experienced under different circumstances. The passion is the same. The pain is the same. That weird thing that bubbles in your chest? Same.I didn’t believe her until I met Baron Spencer and he became my nightmare. Then my nightmare became my reality. I thought I’d escaped him. I was even stupid enough to think he’d forgotten I ever existed.But when he came back, he hit harder than I ever thought possible.And just like a domino—I fell.***“Why are you doing this to me?” I hissed out, searching his blank, stony face.“Because I can,” he offered with a smirk to hide all the pain in his eyes. “Because it’s fun?” he added, chuckling.***Her sense of style was juvenile and horrid, and the back of her hand was still inked with a cherry blossom tree she’d drawn in English Lit, so why the fuck was she still hot as shit?Didn’t matter. I hated her anyway.But her apparent devotion to trying not to be sexy, paired with the fact that she actually was sexy, always made me hard as stone.***We weren’t good guys. We weren’t boyfriend material, we didn’t do monogamy.***Dean and Help were just a fling. They’d be broken up by the end of the month. He was going to dump her—hopefully with her virginity still intact—hurt and angry and looking for a rebound. She’d be fragile, insecure, and vindictive.And that’s when I was going to strike. That’s when I was going to show her she was nothing more than my property.***He knew I wanted her. Wanted her body. Wanted her virginity. Wanted it all. He took it from me, and it was a dick move.***She was starting to get comfortable around me. I pitied her.***This was so on. I was going to fuck Dean’s ex-girlfriend, use her for my personal needs, and toss her away when I was done.***Truth was, he was a dick for going out with her then, and I was a dick for doing her now.But she wasn’t his obsession.His vice.His fucking Achilles heel.She used to leave chewed pencils on her desk every single day in calculus class.I may have picked them up.I may have saved them.They may still be in a drawer somewhere in my old room.***“Listen to yourself, Vicious. You’re obsessed with this girl. You’re in love with this girl, always have been, ever since you realized she’s not afraid or impressed by your bullshit. You’re in deep denial.”***Her indifference to my power somewhat disarmed me. Most people felt helpless around me. Emilia Leblanc never had.***She squinted at me, not budging. I’d forgotten how hard to tame she was. And I’d definitely forgotten how much it turned me on.“You’re pissing me off,” she said quietly, her eyes still searching my face.“And that’s turning me on,” I retorted, my voice flat.***This wasn’t an argument. This was foreplay. She just didn’t know it yet.***You’re my employee. Hence, I make the rules. You will serve me. You will obey me. You. Will . Help . Me. Understood?”***Spending time with my staff reminded me why humans were my least favorite creatures.***I’d noticed the way he looked at me. It was the same way I’d looked at him.We liked what we saw.I hated him so much it made me sick to my stomach that I loved the way he looked.***I reminded myself that this man didn’t do relationships.He did destructions. And one of his past projects was my life.***“You were always good together, the four of you.”A dark smirk found his lips, and he shrugged tiredly. “Until you came along.”He spun me around, and before I could say something— anything —his mouth attacked mine. Every doubt I’d had evaporated.Now there was no barrier. There was no Dean. No HotHoles. Just the two hungry, savage adults who wanted to rip each other to shreds.I wanted to dissolve into smoke, to crawl into him and never leave. It was crazy, but that was how much I craved this man.His mouth was hot, his kiss ravenous and rough. Like he was trying to erase every trace of every other man who’d ever tasted me.***I knew him well enough to know romance was simply not on the menu for him. He was as emotionally available as a jackhammer.This was pure lust, exploding after a decade of simmering quietly, brewed by frustration, jealousy, and hate.***Though I knew she was right. I was missing a few pieces. A few chips I needed in order to be able to love like a normal person does. That’s why I liked breaking things, and why I especially enjoyed breaking Emilia. She was the purest thing I’d ever met.***“I used to think of you as a villain, but you’re not my villain. You’re your own villain.To me, you were a lesson. An important brutal lesson, nothing more and nothing less.”***“How far are you willing to go for this girl, Vic?”I ran a hand through my hair, tugging hard at the roots. “Well, I think I’m about to find the fuck out.”
