4.00 ☆Naurr, because navessa allen put her entire navesussy into this!!❗😭 why was this actually so good?! from laughing to giggling, to blushing, to sweating in places i didn’t know i could sweat, this book felt like hitting the pentagon and i absolutely loved it! imagine a man with golden retriever vibes who wears a mask and stalks the girl he likes. now lord, please help me! 🙏 because if you squint your eyes as hard as you can and look closely at the beginning of this book, you can see self-respect leaving my body for this man.anyway, this story follows josh and ally and is told from a dual pov. josh is this masked figure online who hides behind a mask and posts thirst trap videos on tt. ally, a trauma nurse, loves them. when josh finds out that ally is a fan, he decides he should stalk her.↳ Joshnow, since the very fucking beginning, all of josh's red flags looked very much green to me. 😎 you can’t expect me to ever hate on a 6-foot sociopath masked stalker who breaks into her house just to refill her fridge, then breaks into her car to give her a ride home after seeing she had a bad shift at work. fuck no. i knew the moment he put a camera in her room to watch her but turned it off when she needed privacy, that if approached me i would fold instantly. he's so babygirl and funny! 😂 did someone inform him he's supposed to be scary?! his character development was written so well i honestly wouldn’t have finished this book if it weren’t for him. he gorilla-sealed held this book together.🥳↳ Alyshe was okay i guess . aly is not one of those fmcs i can say i loved, cheered for, or felt related to. i liked her with josh and their banter, but as an individual, i didn’t really like her. i hated the fact that she wanted josh only for sex. she would say the most gen z things, and it made my eyes twitch . i didn't really feel connected to her character or her past as i did with josh, but she was fine i just wish she was written with more depth and complexity like josh.the second half of this book felt kinda random tho. like all of a sudden there was a mafia storyline that didn’t really connect to the first half. it was still fun to read but it felt like two different books put together. and for a dark romance, this one was pretty chill and actually funny. if you’re into dark romance but don’t want it too intense, with a splash of romcom vibes, you’d probably enjoy this one. it doesn’t go too heavy on the drama or angst.also highly recommend the audiobook. the narrators killed it—especially jacob morgan.Read if you like-↦ Butcher and Blackbird↦ Haunting Aldine↦Masked Stalker↦dark romcom↦golden retriever mmcoverall, i really enjoyed this book. therapy bills are going to be sky-high next week! 🎉🥳🎉
