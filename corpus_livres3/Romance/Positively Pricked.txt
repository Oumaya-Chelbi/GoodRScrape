Jane is a catering assistant. Struggling to pay her bills and generally failing at life. Having been recently promoted she’s working an event when she runs into none other than the biggest prick ever, Zane. Zane has recently come into a large fortune and CEO position after the suspicious deaths of his uncles followed by the sudden death of his grandfather. There’s now much else to say about him other than he’s mysterious and I GIANT asshole. After Jane looses her job and through a series of off the wall shenanigans, she ends up working for Zane as his personal PR girl.So I genuinely enjoyed this book. But I am already a fan of Sabrina’s work. (Illegal Fortunes is one of my favorite reads ever!) The thing about her work is that you either love it or you don’t. She tends to, with a quick sentence or two, foreshadow upcoming events at the end of most of her chapters. Which can be killer when try to go to sleep or just put her books down lol. Also, you never miss anything. Occasionally you’ll skip forward a month or two but usually you go through every single detail of what occurs which can sometimes be tedious and make you want to skim a little. I felt like there was a missed chance with what happened with Zane’s family and it was all wrapped up too quickly with zero drama which was kind of a let down as it seemed it all would be leading to something much, much bigger. But overall I’m a huge fan and this book is just another reason why!Zane was of course a major asshole but you could definitely start to see through it when he was around Jane. She was a little clueless about what was happening around her and kind of a doormat where the people around her were concerned but that seems to be another Sabrina Stark trait. Adding side characters that drive you nuts with how ridiculous they are and not having the MCs stand up for themselves. And always having the Heroine end up in totally hilariously, outrageous situations that are almost unbelievable. For instance I’d have kicked paisleys ass out of the house for the crap she pulled and the scenes she created. And as always... my least favorite. There is always, always a woman or many in this case that the H has slept with or fooled around with that the h is constantly exposed to and forced to be around. Sometimes they turn out to be misunderstandings *cough* Lawton *cough* which is nice but not in this case.Which brings me to the safety details, this is not a book I’d recommend for my safety gals. After knowingly having intense feelings for Jane and going so far as to employ her to be close to her he constantly sleeps with and brings around other woman (not all on page and no explicit details) while warning off any man that even looks at her and having jealous BF reactions. All while having this “oh well, I’m having fun banging all these models even though I’m pining for you and you can’t have anyone else, what of it, does it matter?” kind of attitude. I was able to look past it because by this point I expect it from her books(except with Illegal Fortunes!) but it is still yucky and the main thing I dislike in her stories😫😔.All this to say that as long as you have no safety issues I highly recommend this book! Sabrina always delivers on the funny and over the top situations, and alpha heroes and I can’t wait to read what’s next!!
