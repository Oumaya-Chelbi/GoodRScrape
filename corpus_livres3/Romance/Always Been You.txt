Thank you to Wildfire Marketing Solutions and QB Tyler for an ARC in exchange for an honest review.What is there to even say when you literally have 0 complaints?? Like honestly this book was everything I wanted and MORE. I was obsessed when the novella came out last year and when QB said she was expanding into a full length book I was so freaking excited. And it definitely didn’t disappoint!The full length book has all of the goodness and set up from the novella, but trust me it does NOT feel like you are reading the same thing regurgitated back at you. There’s so much more background story added to James and Gabrielle’s relationship, we see more of Monica and their parents, and more on Gabrielle’s biological family. There’s one scene in here where Gabrielle confronts a family member from her past, only to have something else revealed and UGH it was so emotional to read but such a pivotal moment I feel for James and Gabrielle and the way that he has always been there for her. MY HEART.If you’re like me and love taboo stories, then this fully delivers in that department. There’s an age gap and they’re adopted siblings. The way AB built their relationship though it felt so believable that their love for one another would morph over the years into something more and THERE WAS SO MUCH ANGST IN SUCH A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. I truly don’t know how she did it. Because I’m not a fan when couples get together fairly early in stories, I like the slow burn, but oh baby by chapter 5 I was ready to combust and I was cheering them on to act on their feelings. And I mean the hotness of the spice in this…I was losing my mind. You know when you go into a QB Tyler book to have some level of hotness but this blew me away🥵James, Gabrielle, if you’re ever looking for a third…😮‍💨This book overall was just amazing from start to finish I couldn’t put it down and truly is I think one of the best taboo romances I’ve ever read. You’re doing yourself a disservice if you don’t pick it up!Review for full length novel:5 F*CKING STARS.
