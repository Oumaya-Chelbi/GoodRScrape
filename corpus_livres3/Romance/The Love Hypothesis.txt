– 4.5 starsI heard this book started out as a Wattpad story and people weren't impressed with the writing, but honestly I'd take that as a back-handed compliment. Have you read therightWattpad stories? Some of them are masterpieces and no, I don't take criticism. And no, I'm not talking aboutAftereither 😌The Love Hypothesis will go down as the biggest surprise of this year and no one is more surprise than me. This book has been EVERYWHERE I go. I couldn't outrun this book, even if I wanted to. And you know with hype comes great expectations. And with great expectations comes even greater disappointments. Therefore, I made it my mission to go into TLH expecting nothing and received everything.I've read the prologue and I WAS HOOKED!!!When do you ever stumble into a stranger's bathroom blinded, because you're wearing lenses that has been expired for years and said stranger is going to be your biggest motivator for the years to come?Olive and Adam's meet-cute already had me on a chokehold."It's fine." She waved a hand. She'd have rolled her eyes, if they hadn't been on fire. "The burning usually lasts only a few minues.""You mean you've done this before?"She frowned. "Done what?""Put in expired contacts.""Of course. Contacts are not cheap.""Neither are eyes."Followed, the story was brimmed with so many rom-com tropes. SO MANY. Maybe Ali Hazelwood tried a little bit too much to bring all of these tropes in one story and maybe it was a bit too much. Personally, I didn't mind it, cause every Olive x Adam interaction just made me smile like a fool. But here is a list of all the tropes, you can expect when reading The Love Hypothesis:💫 age gap (Olive, 26 & Adam, 34)💫 sunshine-grumpy💫 fake-dating💫 slow-burn💫 workplace romance💫 Ph.D student x professor (but it's not forbidden)💫 mutual pining💫 friends-to-lovers also known as dumbasses-to-lovers💫 one-bed trope (kinda)💫 Hero sees heroine in his clothes and is can't talk for a second💫 guy simping for the girl first💫 dimples💫 asshole-ish Hero who is only soft for his girl💫 endless banter and teasing"Come on. Maybe we're lucky and the chair will spot us. And I'll buy you an ice cream sandwich afterward.""Will I be paying for this ice-cream sandwich?" He sounded resigned now."Likely. Actually, scratch that, you probably don't like ice cream anyawy, because you don't enjoy anything that's good in life." She kept on walking, pensively chewing on her lower lip. "Maybe the cafeteria has some raw broccoli?""I don't deserve this verbal abuse on top of the flu shot.I'll spare the subpar summary of this book, cause y'all can read the blurb for yourself and jump right into everything else 😂｡･ﾟﾟ･The Romance･ﾟﾟ･｡Just look at the list above. It literally has all of my favorite tropes in one book. From the first interaction between Adam and Olive I was clued to the pages. I love their easy banter with each other. Olive teasing him about his age. Adam's hate about everything sugary (but especially Pumpkin Spice Latte)."Are you going to be less harsh, then?""Unlikely."She sighed. "You know, when I have no more friends and everyone hates me because of this fake-dating thing, I'll be super lonely and you are going to have to hang out with me every day. I'll annoy you all the time. Is it really worth being mean to every grad in the program?""Absolutely."Adam is notoriously known as the campus asshole professor who makes every grad student piss their pants. He's super strict when it comes to research and calls his student out on their bullshit when someone is not good enough. But when it comes to Olive, he is a soft harmless kitten. He believes in her so much. Adam always encourages and praises Olive for her brilliant work. Adam Carlsen is Olive's #1 fan."I wish you could see yourself the way I see you."Women in STEM are underrepresentated and it was refreshing to see Olive being one of the few women working there and making a difference with her research on pancreatic cancer. It was interesting to read Olive's frustrating with being a grad student.. all the struggles and insecurites that come with it. All these priviliged white men that think they are some hot shot, but doing the bare minimum work.Olive's smart, a great friend, but you know when I fell in love with her? When Olive and Adam went on their first fake coffee date and Adam offered to pay for her coffee, cuz he knows she's a poor student and what does that girl do? Adds chocolate chip cookie, a banana and a pack of gum to her coffee 😂😂😂 the audacity lmao yes girl get that luxury package lunch 😂"You're so big." He groaned into her neck. His entire body was vibrating with tension."You can take it."The Love Hypothesis was very low on the heat level, but that one sex scene we got. I looooved it 🥵🥵🥵 Every time a Hero has such a big dick that the heroine doesn't know if she can take it and he assures her that she can I'M SCREaMINg 🥵🥵🥵 When Adam tells her that he wants to go down on her until she passes out 🥵🥵🥵🥵 When Adam asked Olive if he can fuck her... I'm on my knees for my consent king 🛐🥵Adam Carlsen, ik hou van jou 🛐🛐🛐Adam: My arm hurtsOlive: From the flu shot?Adam: It's really painful.Olive: Oh, Adam. I'm so sorry.Olive: Should I come over and kiss it better?Adam: You never said it would hurt so bad.Olive: As someone once told me, it's not my job to work on your emotin regulation skills.Adam: 🖕｡･ﾟﾟ･The Friendship between Olive and Anh･ﾟﾟ･｡Anh is Vietnamese and I never see Viet rep in romance book so ofc I'm going to love this girl. Not biased or anything. Anh was a queen anyway and it wasn't hard to stan her 💅"No matter how many pounds of spoiled shrimp cocktail you projectile vomit, you can trust me. We're a team, you and I. And Malcolm, when he's not busy screwing his way though the Stanford population. So if Carlsen is secretly an extraterrestrial life-form planning a takover of Earth that will ultimately result in humanity being enslaved by evil overlords who look like cicadas, and the only way to stop him is dating him, you can tell me and I'll inform NASA–"Find yourself a best friend who would marry you if she thinks you will get deported back to Canada and need a green card. 🥺You don't understand how much I love Anh. She was probably my favorite characters from this whole book (no offense to Olive and Adam, cause I love them a lot).My love for her already started that she didn't want to date Jeremy, because Olive dated him and gave her approval. This girl knows the girl code too well and it's for her that Olive had to come up with this ridicilous idea of kissing the first guy she sees in the hallway to convince Anh that she's over Jeremy, so these two can get it on. But then, Anh is also the best wingwoman without knowing. All of her demands for Olive and Adam to show their PDA (Olive using Adam has her chair ✔️ Olive putting sunscreen on a half naked Adam ✔️ Olive kissing Adam ✔️) The list of sexual harassment Adam could compile, I'd love to see it. 😇｡･ﾟﾟ･The Side-Characters･ﾟﾟ･｡The rest of the secondary characters like Holden and Malcolm were awesome too. I love Adam and Holden's friendship. How Holden tries to embarass Adam and Adam pretending to be annoyed and tolerating him even tho their bromance is more than solid. Most of all Holden has Adam's back."I have access to your Google Calender, asshole. You're not busy. If you don't want to hang out with me, you can just be honest.""I don't want to hang out with you.""You little shit. After the wee we just had. And on my birthday."Adam recoiled slightly. "What? It's not your birthday.""Yes, it is.""Your birthday is April tenth.""Is it, though?"Adam closed his eyes, scratching his forehead. "Holden, we've talked daily for the past twenty-five years, and I have been to at least five Power Rangers-themed birthday parties of yours. The last one was when you turned seventeen. I know when your birthday is.""You always had it wrong, I was just too nice to tell you."Malcolm and Olive had a cute friendship too. Loved how Malcolm was so support of Olive's feeling for Adam even tho he didn't like him. Malcolm with Anh probably the only characters with some brain cells. He gave Olive some good dating advise, but did she listen noooo.｡･ﾟﾟ･A Book not without its faults･ﾟﾟ･｡Like the clown that I am, I really thought this book might be a 5 star read after only reading the prologue lmao that's how much I loved Olive and Adam's first meeting 😂 But of course I jinxed myself, cause there were a couple of things that I annoyed me.I call this book dumbasses-to-lovers for a reason. Olive and Adam had clearly feelings for each other, but were too chicken shit to confess them. Olive had confessed to Malcolm that she was falling in love w Adam and Adam heard it and when Olive said she was talking about someone else, that dumbass really believed her. I mean it makes for good angst for exacly 3 seconds cause I could feel my boy's pain, but how could he not known it was him all along. Same with Olive and her thinking the "amazing girl" Adam was pining for all these year was some random women in his faculty like 😭😭😭 guys I thought you were SMART 😭And that ending was so unsatisfying. I hate it when a romance doesn't have a proper love confession scene. I know Adam loves Olive and he told it to other, but we never got his "I love you" that he said to Olive. There was her confession and then it was cut right to the epilogue that wasn't all that satisfying either..｡･ﾟﾟ･Conclusion･ﾟﾟ･｡Should I study for an exam that I have tmrr and instead have read this book? Yes. (1)Will I fail said exam because of this book? Also yes. (2)Will I blame Ali Hazelwood and fictional characters for my inability to manage my life? Y-E-S. (3)Would I do it all over again? See answers (1) to (3)No regrets, I love Olive and Adam so much and The Love Hypothesis will be in my favorite books I've read this year. ♥️P.S. this book taught me to carry myself with the confidence of a medicore white man if I wanna reach my goal and I'll always remember that. I'll go into the exam with that mentality, I'm suing if I'm still going to fail 😌
