I gotta say I am a sucker for a story with PINING/where one of the characters has been in love forever. Add to that a wonderful, not obnoxious (maybe a little shy) male lead and I was looking forward to this one!The problem with friends to lovers trope is that there has to be an actual SOLID not ludicrous barrier for them to not be together. Sadly this book didn’t have that.Friend Zoned is a typical NA College story where the “heroine” (which she isn’t) refuses to see what’s right in front of her, and instead keeps running away. Over and over again. And keeps hurting the male lead. Over and over again. Plus some stupid drama thrown in.The Pros —👍 a male lead that isn’t obnoxious!!! Or the ever famed ArrOgAnT jErkK that’s so popular these days. He’s confident in himself AND somehow doesn’t feel the need to be in your face about it. This bumped it from 1⭐️ to 2.👎The thing that bothered me the most about this novel …. is that Violet keeps asking what SHE wants. She never ONCE thinks about him! For example- she says “I” don’t want things to change! “I” don’t know how I feel about this - “I” am scared. “I” am going to run away. She never once says to Sam - “enough about me - how do YOU feel?!” Or stop to think - “hey, if he had this reaction to me maybe HE would like an opinion on this or maybe HE would like things to change?!” She is blindingly selfish and never even has no clue anywhere in the novel. Even the last conflict when she shuts him down yet again he asks if it’s what she really wants and she says yes - it’s like you’re supposed to feel so sorry for this poor girl … but she never takes HIS feelings into consideration. At this point it’s unforgivable to me because she KNOWS how long he’s been pining for her. She makes that callous decision thinking only of herself. Honestly it makes her an ungrateful self centered bitch, and Sam deserves so much better. Sorry not sorry.👎He enables this pattern of her behavior for their entire relationship bc he ALWAYS gives her what she wants and never thinks of himself. He is just so selfless, but honestly it’s so overboard he becomes a bit of a doormat. He even realizes at some point how he always puts her needs first, but he realizes just how selfish SHE is. Honestly I don’t even think the author realizes what a little monster she created.👎I couldn’t empathize with the conflict. It’s just awful and so stupid. Thankfully, she DOES take responsibility for it and she DOES realize she is an idiot.👎 her friends conflict with her boyfriend.. I just can’t empathize there either. She is so shocked her boyfriend of 2 years had the AUDACITY to propose to her…. though they’re madly in love, have been together seriously for two years, and she is planning to move to her city and INTO HIS APARTMENT when she graduates in a few months. Poor guy. He’s good enough for her to live with and date, but not marry..And THEN SHE HAS THE AUDACITY to say she loves him but “doesn’t want to be a CHILD BRIDE at the age of 22”. 22 (really 23-24 by the time the wedding would be) is a GROWN ASS ADULT. this is what’s wrong with our current times. 23 IS AN ADULT, NOT A CHILD. I was married at 22, so I’m offended by this and think it’s simply ridiculous. And GASP I managed to thrive in my career even AFTER I was married!If she really loved him and actually wanted to be with him all she had to do was say yes, then ask for a long engagement. Most engagements are a year or 2 anyways!👎 I also hate violet and how ridiculous she is.👎 I skimmed the last half of the novel because it also got a bit painful/boring/repetitive.
