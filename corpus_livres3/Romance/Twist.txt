⭐️5+ "Tell Me You Love Me" Stars⭐️It’s been hours since I’ve read the very last line ofTwistand I’m still not okay! That cliffhanger was so cruel and devastating!!! I’ve been thinking about this outstanding story all day long, obsessing over Ria and Kova! This fourth installment in theOff Balance Seriesis the best yet in my opinion! It’s saying something as the previous books were already phenomenal! Lucia Franco killed me and revived me time and time again during my read of this highly emotional and sexy taboo romance with the roller-coaster of feels!Adrianna is so determined to reach her dream of being an Olympian. She has a lot of obstacles to surmount on a personal level to achieve her ultimate goal though. She’s careless with her decisions at times and certainly doesn’t have it easy! I felt she’s kind of denial of her tough situation and pushes herself to the limit leading her to some breaking moments! She made me cry and rage for her!As much as I admire Adrianna and her tenacity, I feel that Kova is the highlight of this book! His transformation from harsh coach to devoted lover is marvellous and swoon-worthy! The Kova haters can’t deny his complete loyalty and powerful feelings for Ria now! I’ve been Team Kova since the very first book and it’s more than obvious now that there’s no other man for Ria than the sexy Russian. He’s the complete package and he finally opens up like never before. He’s completely vulnerable for Adrianna, proving to her his profound affection. I melted over his tender side and the sincerity of his feelings. That doesn’t mean that he’s all soft. Oh no! He’s still the same dirty talker with a possessive side."𝙒𝙚 𝙖𝙧𝙚 𝙖 𝙩𝙚𝙖𝙢 - 𝙗𝙪𝙩 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙩𝙧𝙪𝙩𝙝 𝙞𝙨, 𝙬𝙝𝙚𝙣 𝙮𝙤𝙪 𝙚𝙭𝙝𝙖𝙡𝙚, 𝙄 𝙞𝙣𝙝𝙖𝙡𝙚. 𝙉𝙤𝙩 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙤𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙧 𝙬𝙖𝙮 𝙖𝙧𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙.

While at the beginning it was mostly based on a mutual physical pull, it’s now clear that they’re both into deep on an emotional level! This novel shows this couple being so in sync with each other at moments that it’s truly breathtaking! The way they understand and pushes each other is so inspiring!The story progresses between poignant moments of true despair and goes to powerful instants of purely decadent pleasure. It’s filled with so many highs and lows! Kova and Ria are so passionate and so in love that nothing exists, sometimes making them more than reckless. They’re taking so many risks and I was constantly expecting for them to be caught together!Twistgave me an amalgam of extreme sensations! I cried my eyes out over Adrianna’s fate, but also felt the rush of pure passion from her stolen moments with Kova. I also was left speechless over that sudden ending! It nearly killed me!
