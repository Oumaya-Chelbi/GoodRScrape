– 3.435 starsEDIT: I knew it was coming that one day I wake up and think about this book again and hate most about it. So I actually re-read HannahGarrett's novella again and felt sooo disappointed. Love the idea of them being the first book in the series and then, the last book ending with their chapters, but Elle Kennedy did (all) the characters so dirty... 😭–The Legacy is not what I have in mind when I think of an epilogue novel(las). If you decide to write additional novella for each couple, then I expect a lot of domestic fluff and not fights about important milestones like marriage, pregnancy, kids etc. These kind of conflicts can be handled in each couple's full lenght novel. I really expected more happy scenes between each couple and instead we got some heavy stuff and unnecessary fights & drama.BUTTTT despite all these issues that I have with this book, I still had a good time (mostly) reading this and I'm feeling generous right now to round up the 3.5 stars. Maybe tomorrow morning I'll wake up and choose violence and round down, we'll see. 😈It's just one of those books, when I was reading it, I enjoyed it, but the more I think about it, the more issues I have with it. Was The Legacy great? No, far from it. I'd even go so far to call it pretty trash, but I went into this book with the lowest expectations (and so should you), so it turned out to be more entertaining than expected. It's nice to get some glimpses into where all of the Off Campus couples are now, but that's it.≡≡≡≡≡The following part hasSPOILERSfor the whole book. Best read after finishing the book or on your own risk≡≡≡≡≡*****»»---Logan & Grace----««(3.5 – The Pact – stars)This novella was already published so there wasn't much new content to Logan and Grace story, but surprisingly I didn't enjoy it any less the second time around, even tho this couple is not my favorite in the series. Grace and Logan's part of the book is probably the most chill out of all the four couples. Their 'conflict' wasn't as bad as the others and Logan and Grace had the most couple time where they were happy in each other company imo.“You’re really trying to sell me on this fireplace.”“Because it’s fucking awesome and I wish we had one in the apartment.”“No, you don’t. They’re a fire hazard.”“You’re a fire hazard.” I wink at her. “Because you’re so hot.”Grace sighs.How did I forget what a dork Logan is? 😭“We’re almost at the countdown. I expect some enthusiastic yelling. Ready, babe?”“Sure. But we don’t have to yell—”“TEN!” Oh brother. “NINE!” he shouts, motioning me with his hand to join in. And because I love this guy with all my heart, I make him happy and scream right along with him.»»---Dean & Allie---««(4 – The Proposal – stars)“From the day that you took me back after we broke up because I was an asshole and got high and missed your play.” Nope. Also terrible. I try again. “Allie. I don’t even know where to start.”“Clearly,” comes Garrett’s dry voice. “By the way, the answer is no. Go ahead and close that box.”I forgot how funny Dean can be, cause I had a blast being in his head again. It started out amazing with Dean practising his proposal infront of Garrett and Logan. These guys together are the comedian trio I didn't know I needed 😂 And the guys planning Tucker's bachelor party???! Omg I love it. Brilliant idea of inviting all their former teammates and playing hockey together. The friendship between Dean, Garrett, Logan and Tucker was hands down the best part of this whole book.“You know what, try it on me,” Logan suggests. “G is clearly not a good proposal receiver.” “Oh, fuck off, I’m a great proposal receiver. It’s just that the proposal sucks. I’m not going to say yes to something that doesn’t wow me.”“Go wow yourself,” I grumble, flipping up my middle finger.Garrett beams at me. “I do. Every day when I look in the mirror.”I have a new found respect for Tucker after that psycho monologue of telling Dean that he would commit suicide on his deathbed just to steal his thunder as a warning that Dean is not allowed to propse at his weding 😂😂 Man, I didn't think Tucker had it in him, but he went full on ginger crazy 😂And then we have the conflict of Allie not wanting to get married anytime soon and stopping Dean before he could propose, which was stupid. Even tho it was cute when Allie realised her mistake and propsed to Dean instead.I grit my teeth. “I can’t fucking believe Logan would do this to us. And after we complimented his dick?”My fiancée sighs. “We?”“Oh, like you weren’t impressed too,” is my accusatory reply.“Fine, I was,” Allie relents. She offers a shrug. “Mrs. Logan is a lucky woman.”I nod in agreement. “A very lucky—” I stop abruptly. “Wait. What?”»»---Tucker & Sabrina---««(2.75 – The Honeymoon – stars)Elle Kennedy did Tucker and Sabrina so dirty. Once again. Their book was already not the best and this novella was a great opportunity to give some cute couple time together, but noo??? The first chapter was good with Tucker and Jamie and then with each chapter it just got worse and worse.“What happened to your tiara and jewelry, little darlin’?” I scoop her up because she’s liable to fall asleep on her tiny feet. “You lose them in the rope tunnel?”“I gave them away,” she answers, resting her cheek against my shoulder.“Now why would you do that?”“Because Lilli and Maria wanted to be princesses too, but they didn’t have any princess stuff so I gave them princess stuff.”Jamie is the cutest baby 🥺Sabrina and Tucker literally went to their honeymoon in hell. Anything that could go wrong, went wrong. Plane crash. Check. Stung by a jellyfish. Check. Sunburn. Check. Coconut falling on your head. Check.“Ready?” Tucker says.“Do it.” Nodding, he winds his arm back and hurls Alexander as far as he possibly can. Then we stand there holding hands, watching the doll bob in the calm waves, slowly carried out to sea. “Go with God,” Tucker says solemnly.“Babe. He’s going to Satan and we both know it.”“Truth, darlin’.”The plot with the doll that the guys were gifting to each other was hilarious. It was always interesting to see where Alexander would appear next, only to see the couples' reaction to it. 😂»»---Garrett & Hannah---««(3.49 – The Legacy – stars)Hannah and Garrett's part was the one I was looking forward the most, because they are my babies. So I was bummed to see how sad they were (Hannah with never finding the right moment to tell Garrett about the pregnancy and Garrett with having to deal with his abusive father all the time).When Elle Kennedy said "The Legacy" what she really meant is Garrett protecting his father's "legacy" and I'm feeling like the biggest clown on earth. 🤡 How I thought that this book might pave the way for future Off Campus generation, but so much of the HannahGarrett novella was just Garrett being in a shitty mood, because no one knows what his father is really like, bc Garrett is too embarrassed of his past to tell anyone.Garrett’s fingers tangle in my hair. He pulls away for a moment to meet my eyes, staring at me with an expression I’ve never seen before. My breath catches.“What?”“I love you. Maybe more than I ever have.”But the other domestic HannahGarrett moment we got, I ate them up. Garrett is such a dumbass and I love him for it. When he thought that Hannah would be moving out and run to the studio to make his declaration lmao or when he found out that they are expecting twins. Goal of the year, they say, but I say comedian of the year. 😂“Congratulations,” she announces with a grin. “You’re having twins.”“Twins?” I echo stupidly. “You serious, Doc?”“Twins?” I say again. “Like two?”“Two,” she confirms.Garrett’s face collapses. “I only bought one jersey.”And the bromance between Logan and Garrett?? If I didn't ship Garrett and Hannah together, I'd would consider Logan x Garrett as a good pairing.“I still can’t believe you got married without me,” he accuses his best friend. I fight a laugh. “It’s not a team sport, sweetie.” He ignores me.“I was supposed to be your best man.” He leans past me to glare at Logan. “You realize this means when Wellsy and I have a wedding, you’re not best man number one anymore. I’m giving it to Dean. Dean, Tucker, then you.”Logan leans forward too. “No, you’re not. It’s going to be me first.”Garrett sighs. “It’s going to be you first.”“You two want to get a room?” I ask as they practically hang over me, making googly eyes at each other.P.s. As much as I like Jake Connelly, but him being the top scorer of the league above Garrett? No that's just not right and unacceptable. When it comes to all things hockey Garrett is always going to be #1 in everything. 😌┍━━━━━━━━━━━━━┑OFF CAMPUS SERIES#1 The Deal - 5 stars#2 The Mistake – 4 stars#3 The Score – 4.5 stars#4 The Goal – 3.75 stars#5 The Legacy – 3.435 stars┕━━━━━━━━━━━━━┙
