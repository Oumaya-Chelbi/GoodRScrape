Another horror "romance" that could've been better if the FMC was a whole different person.The MMC was actually PERFECT in my opinion, he was more anti-hero and dark than the ones that are marketed as such. Birth control tampering? Check. Caveman behavior? Double check. Lack of remorse? Triple check.This is really insta-lust and insta-love in the MMC's part, miss FMC was not ready for anything and honestly she was irritating me big time.“I though women were the ones who were supposed to get clingy after sex, not men. You’re supposed to have snuck out this morning, not stuck around to get all midlife crisis on me.” His laugh is low and easy. “Sorry baby, not gonna happen. I’m not clingy, I’m just not gonna disrespect my woman by fucking you and then walking out.”He fucks and dips, it's a problem. He stays to take care of you, it's a bigger problem. What do you want girly? The literal psychopath MMC makes more sense than you.And after learning that she got pregnant without her knowing you know what she does?My cell rings again, but I ignore it, clicking in and changing the caller ID from Grumpy Elf to Asshole before it starts ringing again.OOHH BURRNN🔥 YOU GOT HIM WITH THIS ONE🔥🔥She was annoying.But the MMC, he was a horror movie from the 70's material. But before that, he was devoted and obsessed with his woman.I want to own her on a primitive level, I want her to be more mine than hers. My woman, my belonging, my toy, and I want her to want it as much as I do.He is a man of his word.“Stop trying to fight this or I’ll get you so cum drunk you’ll do whatever I want you to, then I’ll fly you to Vegas and tie you to me legally. I’m not afraid to put a ring on it, Peaches. Ring on your finger, my baby in your belly, sounds fucking good to me.”He does it backwards tho, she gets pregnant first😜This possession, this basic need for her scares the shit out of me, because I know I’m forcing this on her and I’m not even sure she really wants it. She likes me, she wants to fuck me, but she’s not ready for a serious relationship, marriage and babies, but I just don’t care.SOMEONE NEEDS TO CALL THE POLICE ON HIM🚨🚨So, she learns that he switched the birth control pills with placebo, gets mad, runs away, he finds her, kidnaps her and gives her the sweetest speech ever.“I’m not asking for forgiveness.” “What?” I ask, rolling to a sitting position and turning to look at him. “I don’t need to ask for forgiveness because I’m not sorry.” My mouth falls open and I just stare at him, feeling like I’m dreaming, because there’s no way this asshole just told me he’s not sorry he lied and deceived me into getting pregnant without my consent. Lips parted, I try to speak, but no words come, because honestly what do I even say to that? “I’m glad you’re having my baby.” He just keeps talking. Why is he still talking? “I fucking love that inside of you is our child, that you’re gonna get big with our son or daughter. I told you right back at the start I wanted to breed you.”She forgives him.Which one of them is crazier, I don't know, but hey, they got their HEA, so who cares, right?🥰
