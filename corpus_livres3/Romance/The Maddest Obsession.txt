☆⋅⋆ ──1st read 2020: 5 stars☆⋅⋆ ───x re-read 2023:infinity times infinity stars 💫Christian and Giannaarethe definition of romance. Reading their book will always give me the greatest high, no drug could ever achieve. There is a reason why christiangianna only have one book, because perfection has already been achieved. 🙏"There are plenty of women who could make you happier, Christian.""You're the only one I want."Some people are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them. Gianna Marino and Christian Allister are all of the above.Warning:This reviews contains a lot of fangirling. Might even give you diabetes by reading it."It means, to live with wolves, you have to howl like a wolf."Goodreads might say that I've only read this book twice, which is a huge lie considering the number of times I've re-read this book hasn't been invented yet, cause it goes beyond infinity.Anyway, my first review forThe Maddest Obsessionwas a disservice to Gianna and Christian. It didn't capture theobsessionlove I have for this book and for this characters enough. I'm really sorry and I needed to do better.My darling ➳ ✨GIANNARUSSOMARINOALLISTER✨:The love I have for Gianna is out of this world. She's my darling, my sweetheart, my love, my baby and my little star. Christian and I do not have a lot of things in common, butONEthing and perhaps the most important thing is that we're both crazy obsessed with Gianna. 💫That girl has the biggest heart in the universe, but covers it up with sarcasm, alcohol and drugs and a lot of sass.She has so much love to give, but no one gives a shit about her. Antonio, Sydney, her father … they are all on top of my hit-list and I wish them all the bad karma in the world. Whatever will come their way, they deserved it.Stopping abruptly, I turned and walzed back up to the counter, taking my heels off as I went. "Can you make sure my cellmate – goes by Cherry – gets these?""You want to give an opioid-addicted prostitute" – she tilted the shoe to look inside – "Jimmy Choos?"I brightened. "Yes, please.""Gianna wasn't in the passenger seat when I headed outside–she was across the street, handing money to a homeless man who looked like he'd just been released from the state penitentiory."My girl is selfless af. She would walk barefoot in the snow to give some prostitute her shoes and give money to the ones in need. Gianna is the best and I truly thought I couldn't love her more, but then she had to go and sayTHISto the love of her life:If you looked a little less like an anal-retentive asshole, you might get laid every once in a while.And that's children, is how my obsession began. How can youNOTlove her, if you don't please get help 🙏. My obsession really went out of hand, cause I made a list why Gianna and I are soulmates. If you look at the following list, you would think Christian who?Kissing Christian Allister made me feel more alive than any drug ever could1. Sooo, i've never kissed someone whose name is Christian Allister, but yk semantics. If I'd kiss Christian I'd definitely feel like Gianna too. It's the thought that counts. Told ya we're the same person."That's because I only run when someting's chasing me."2. Never in my life have I related to something more. Because same girl same. I hate running. Running was invented by the Devil and shouldn't be done under any circumstances. The act of sweating by exercising? D-I-S-G-U-S-T-I-N-G.It had only taken five days for me to feel like I needed to find a support group for Christian addicts.3. Did someone say Christian ADDICTS? 🙋‍♀️ The only difference between us is that all it took me was less than one hour before I got addicted and not 5 days. That's some resilience, I'm giving her that. If anyone knows where to find said support group for Christian addicts, please show us the way, Mina and I, we truly need to find the way back.Later, I pushed his meticulously-placed toothbrush an inch to the left in retaliation.4.THAT'S HOW YOU START A WAR!If your significant other pisses you off, you rearrange his toothbrush so his OCD ass is getting triggered. That's how it's done, Gianna baby show them! She's my spirit animal. One day when I grow up, I aspire to be this passive-aggressive and petty. There is still so much for me to learn from Queen Gi.➳✨CHRISTIAN – THE KING – ALLISTER✨Black suit. Broad shoulders. Smooth lines. Blue.The fact that I will never have a guy like Christian who is crazy obsessed with me for years and calls me "malyshka" or "moya zvedochka" is what is wrong with the world. Tell me what's the point? What's-the-fucking-point-in-living? Maybe I'm still in denial, but what I know for sure is that I'll never get over it and will mourn this forever.I couldn't help but think this was a man all other men aspired to be. He was the perfect prototype, and everyone else had just gotten the small details wrong.No offence to the rest of the male population, but they just don't have what it takes to be on Christian's level. He shot someone because he found that person annoying for god sake and not to forget that guy disrespected Gianna infront of him.He looked up. His eyes were cold enough to give me frostbite."No," I breathed.But it was too late.He pushed the door open, and his lazy, heartless gaze found Charming. A muffled pop hit my ears. Blood splattered across the counter and cupboards. White powder dusted into the air as Charming hit the floor, cloudy blue eyes wide open, a bullet hole in his forehead.I love psychotic characters so much. Christianreallydoesn't like it if people touch his stuff.Noted.For someone so cold, the world that come out of Christian's mouth… whew my ovaries exploded.If you ran, Gianna…" The words were malicious yet somehow as soft and desperate as sex in a war-torn field. He pressed his lips to my ear. "I would find you.""What are you afraid of?""Everything," I whispered, trailing my finger across the starched collar of his dress shirt. "You're not afraid of me." We were so close his cheek brushed my tear-streaked one when he rasped, "And baby, I'm worse than the dark.""I'm going to ruin every part of your body for any other man, malyshka, and you're going to thank me when I'm done."Jeez, sir chill!Please stop for a moment and let us all ordinary humans breath for a second. Your charm is hitting me so fast & hard in the face, it's making me dizzy. 🥵He helped me rinse off the dishes and clean up the kitchen. Then, he held my face and kissed me softly on the lips."Thank you for dinner, malyshka."I don't know where Christian learnt his manners, because it's obviously not from his mother.But a man who can show appreciation when his woman does someting for him: ✨A GEM✨ He can tell me that he can throw a 50kg rice sack around and that doesn't even make him half as manly as just having decent manners and saying thank you. It's not even something big, but the fact that Christian is always thanking Gianna for making dinner is making me so soft! Grand gestures are overrated, start with the little things first.Safe to say that Christian ruined me for all fictional and non-fictional men.➸THE DRESSED-TO-THE-NINES AGENT & THE WALKING FASHION DISASTERA.K.A ✨MY PARENTS✨Christian and Gianna were two asteroids orbiting around each other for 7 years and meant to collide at some point. They tried so hard to stay away, but one can not outrun destiny.I once heard a proverb that said "You often meet your destiny on the road you take to avoid it." and it fits Christian & Gianna perfectly. They couldn't be more the polor oppsites, but that's what makes themPERFECTtogether.Christian the cold OCD dirty perfectionist fed who has his whole life planned down to every meticulous detailmeven the woman he's going to marry. And thenBOOMenter Gianna the chaotic bubbly live-for-the-moment entrepreneur slash gambler Italian who dressed like the love child of Britney Spears and Kurt Cobain. They hate that they feel even an ounce of attraction, but every time they meet their explosive chemistry is undeniable.I stepped on each of his shoes and then rose to my tiptoes. With a shot of vodka on my tongue, my lips hovered close to his. Close enough to kiss. Close enough to bite and lick. My breast brushed his chest and heat shot straight to my core. When his lips parted, I let the liquor trickle from my mouth to his.Christian and Gianna are hands down one of NA most entertaining couple and it's all because of theirBANTER. There is nothing that brings me more joy than seeing Gianna's witty answers and Christian's dry responses to everything she says."What did you do to your hair?""What?" My lips formed a pout. "You don't like it? I did it for you. I heard you like blondes.""You been thinking about me?" he drawled."Every day, every hour. You're always there, like a fungus, or an incessant bug swarming around my heard."Paaa-lease, imagine someone else calling Christian an incessant bug. INSTANT DEATH. But coming from Gianna, that's the highest praise one can get. We stan one sassy queen."You blackmailed some unfortunate girl to marry you, bought a house in the suburbs, and had two kids." That was an obvious negative. The next guess escapted me before he could respond. "You visited Antarctica and realized it was home." I was so pleased with myself for that one, and it showed. "You done?"I pursed my lips. "Yes."AHAHAHA. I can't. I really can't with this girl. Christian is acting like he's so done with Gianna, but his heart secretly SOARS every time she opens her mouth."Say something in Russian.""Ty samaya krasivaya zhenshchina kotoruyu ya kogda-libo videl."**"What did you say?""You're annoying.""I would hate to be Russian if it takes that many words to say something so simple."**You are the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.ADLDK$/IEOWOM(/ZTF§E/ZGJGF"WMSLEÖ=)$?`DKL YOOOOO RIP.Here lies my completely obliterated heart and ovaries. Cause of destruction: Christian Allister beeing a smooth motherf*cker.He looked at the dessert in my hands as though he'd never tried sugar before. He nodded toward it. "Chocolate?""Arsenic.""My favorite."He took the plate from my hand and slammed the door.The range they have, to go from that** to this.UNPARALLELED SHIT. If that's not couple goals, I don't know what is."I'm clean," he rasped."I'm not worried. I'm sure your body temperature is too cold for any STDs to survive."LMAO 😂 Gianna roasting Christian's cold demeanor. Girl, I aspire to be such a savage!"Who's paying for this private plane ride? My tax dollars?""You have to make an income to pay taxes.""I do. I'm an … entrepreneur.""You're a gambler," I corrected dryly."Same thing, really."SIR? Back off! Not everyone in this world can be a fed. Entrepreneurs like Gianna are EXTREMELY important for the economy. I just wrote an exam on Entrepreneurship SO I KNOW. I'm basically an expert on that topic. Takes an entrepreneur to see one 🤓What if someone arrests me while you're in the bathroom?""I'd bail you out.""If you couldn't?""I'd be locked up beside you."I- 🥺🥺🥺 my babies are so precious. I love them so much omg. If something would ever happen to them, I'd burn the world down.And one last quote. I already had to cut down A LOT of this review because initially this was a thesis, but Goodreads said no. I hate you @Goodreads, you made me choose between my children."Would you visit my grave if I died?" His eyes grew dark. "I'd die before you were ever in a grave, malyshka." I loved his possessive side. And I loved his dark side, too.Leaving all snark and sarcasm aside, my favorite thing about Gianna and Christian is that they put on a facade for the outside with their indifferent / no-care-in-the-world persona, but they could see each other's truth beyond it. Gianna saw that something dark and dirty was lurking behind his cold eyes, while Christian knew Gianna was a vulnerable girl who just wanted to be loved, but deep down felt like she didn't deserve it. Gianna was and will always be the chink in Christian's armour."Ask me what her name means.""What does her name mean?""It means ruler of men."They are soulmates. As much as they tried to stay away, fate brought them back together over and over again.Christian was there for Gianna's most pivotal moments and helped her through her lows.My voice was a whisper. "I'll make him love me, you'll see." A thumb skimmed across my cheek. "If anyone can do it, it would be you…" His voice was soft and rough. "Moya zvezdochka."Christian @ Gianna the whole time:And that was how Christian felt every time Gianna married some old dude, who was twice or trice her age, and who wasn't him:Christian was SCREAMING CRYING SHAKING in his office losing his goddamn mind. He was simping hard for Gianna knowing he could not have her.The Maddest Obsession called me lonely in Russian and English over 333 pagesand you know what? I'm totally fine with it, because in some fictional universe somewhere in New York, Christian & Gianna are sitting in a park and feeding pigeons together while whispering cute russian endearments to e/o.This was so hard to cut down so much, but I hope I made my parents proud and I absolutely can't wait to see them again in The Darkest Temptation.┍━━━━━━━━»•» «•«━┑MADE SERIES#1The Sweetest Oblivion­– 3.5 stars#2The Maddest Obsession– 5+ stars#3The Darkest Temptation– 4.25 stars┕━»•» «•«━━━━━━━━┙
