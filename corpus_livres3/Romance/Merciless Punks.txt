Merciless Punks by Madeline Fay is the third part in the Dolls and Douchebags series, which is a dark, bully, enemies to lovers, why choose romance.A little revenge, a little vengeance and a whole lot of pain I think is the perfect description for this one.This book begins right where it left off in part two and if you’ve made it through the previous books, you’ll know the author is fully immersed in the world of darkness in the Dolls and Douchebags series.But I also felt like Merciless Punks is where the barriers start to come down. There’s tender and caring moments, which are still very true for each character, and the scene with Tillie and Dalton is like a moment of change. But that doesn’t mean that the level of dark, violent, suffering and all round anger is dismissed. It’s just been tweaked…maybe made a little more wicked…a little more punishing, but in a way that Tillie is more in control of.The pace is quick and each scene follows through the book has a reason, and you can see it’s building up for part four, and where hopefully those last few questions will be answered.POV’s from mainly Tillie, but also Tey, Logan, and Dalton. Oh and the newest intriguing man…Dom. And of course Cruz.I love that Dom wasn’t just a one time acquaintance from the previous book, as he and Tillie seemed to have this magnetic attraction that needed to be explored - I didn’t want to mention this in my review of Vicious Punks as it almost seemed spoilery at the time.
