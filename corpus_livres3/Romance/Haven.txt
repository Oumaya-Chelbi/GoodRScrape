Okay so this got me conflicted. If i focus on the smut, steam and the sexy af men it was a great and entertaining story. But then the author added trauma to our Heroine's character development and that 𝐰𝐞𝐥𝐥 𝐝𝐢𝐝 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐠𝐨 𝐝𝐨𝐰𝐧 𝐬𝐨 𝐰𝐞𝐥𝐥. I'm gonna go with 2 stars cause my brain won't let me ignore this.Now if you don't mind the little issues i'll get to in a minute, you'll have a fast-burn sexy read on your hands. Cause the smut, chemistry and passion was on point and hot as hell. So whether you agree with me or not if you can get past it, this will not bother you. Lucky Bastards.]|I{•---------⋘⋙---------------•⪼⦕࿅⦖⪻•---------------⋘⋙---------•}I|[Now you can't sell me even under the guise of insta-love that a woman who's been isolated and beaten for two years by her addicted, drunk and abusif ex-boyfriend, had sex with a guy she just met and lusting for more only three hours after she escaped from him. 𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐬. 𝐖𝐢𝐥𝐥. 𝐍𝐨𝐭. 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐮𝐭𝐞. 𝐍𝐨 𝐌𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭.There is no way that less than 𝟏𝟎 hours after escaping the guy who practically raped her every night and routinely threw her out of the bed in the middle of night, to drag her out and push her down the stairs just because, will be ready mentally or physically for any act of intimacy. I'm sorry but it doesn't make sense to me, you want to write smut by all means I'm here for it, but don't try to add layers to your characters that do not work with the pace of your story.Hannah wanting to feel safe, loved and get her freedom and power back, yes absolutely I'm here for it. But her immediately having sex 𝐎𝐍 𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐒𝐀𝐌𝐄 𝐃𝐀𝐘 she left the bastard and met the gues is a no way possibility. She never flinched or had any personal space awareness or flashback, I'm sorry but that's not possible.𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐮𝐦𝐚 𝐝𝐨𝐞𝐬 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐜𝐨𝐨𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞, her deciding to have a fresh start doesn't explain her open behavior. And having 𝐎𝐍𝐄 nightmare does not count as struggling after two years of abuse.]|I{•---------⋘⋙---------------•⪼⦕࿅⦖⪻•---------------⋘⋙---------•}I|[𝟏𝟗𝟓 pages was already too short for a 𝐑𝐇 with multiple 𝐏𝐎𝐕 but usually it's fine because we read them for the smut and not the deep poetic Romance. At least i do. So you cannot have the center of your harem deal with a 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐮𝐦𝐚 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐡𝐞𝐚𝐯𝐲 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐟𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐡 𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐥𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐨𝐝. Cause It wasn't just physical but also a psychological one, the bastard was a master manipulator on top of being a perverted sadist. Trauma is not a personality trait, you can't throw it on like it's a joke. Use it properly or don't use it at all.Now if she was on the run for a year or two before she met them, then yes, her behavior would be completely 𝐁𝐄𝐋𝐈𝐄𝐕𝐀𝐁𝐋𝐄. But presenting me with a victim of abuse less than 𝟑 hours after her escape, having only the clothe on her back, a stolen car, and a bag with an attitude that feels like she had years of therapy to repair the damage to her psyche and confidence is 𝐁𝐔𝐋𝐋𝐒𝐇𝐈𝐓]|I{•---------⋘⋙---------------•⪼⦕࿅⦖⪻•---------------⋘⋙---------•}I|[Again if i can get my brain to stop being a cantankerous 𝐁*𝐓𝐂𝐇 and forget that giant red flag of inconsistency it wasn't that bad. This was a fast paced fun smutty story and it should have been just that. Since there is 𝐀𝐋𝐖𝐀𝐘𝐒 a lack of character development in shorter story, i was ready for it. You didn't need to give your 𝐅𝐌𝐂 trauma to make her interesting or strong, especially if you're not gonna follow through with it. Where was the actual healing, no i phrased that wrong cause we didn't get to have any sort of healing since she wasn't actually traumatized or damaged.I know i may seem harsh or picky here but i take the stories as you give them to me. 𝐈 𝐰𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐧𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐭𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐚 𝐒𝐦𝐮𝐭𝐭𝐲 𝐏𝐍𝐑 𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐚𝐧 𝐄𝐩𝐢𝐜 𝐅𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐬𝐲. So if you give me an erotica standalone taboo 𝐑𝐇 full of sexy times, i will expect exactly that and judge it for what it is. Here the trauma was not necessary or needed it, actually it ruined the vibe this story was aiming for instead of adding to it. 𝐌𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐝𝐞𝐩𝐭𝐡 𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐚𝐥 𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐩𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐬. It's that simple or at least give us a prologue with a time jump to explain her behavior.
