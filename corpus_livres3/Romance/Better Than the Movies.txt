This book,guys,why did I wait so long to start this book?The rom com movie references felt like such anostalgic hug and ode to rom comsIt genuinely felt like I transported back to being a teenager reading this with the way it had me smiling and laughing like a fool besides reliving some teenage angst and awkwardness I felt then. Each chapter began with a quote from all the rom coms I grew up on as a kid and believe they were integrated seamlessly into each chapter. This was super cute, somewhat cheesy yet fluffy but very much like a love letter to rom coms which was also obvious from the animations on the cover4.5 starsTo me, this particular YA book was portrayed incredibly realistic with certain scenarios and I was somewhat nervous to read this given mixed reviews but I’m glad I took a chance on itWES BENNETT.The famous Wes I’ve been hearing about for months didn’t disappoint. Where was he when I was 17?? I’m well into my 20s but life then would’ve been less stressful trying to understand boys lol he was so attentive, caring, funny & charming. I swooned, I was grinning, and I’d very much like an adult Wes my age thank you. His attention to detail and care, the maturity he exemplifies, seeing Liz for who she was, effortlessly just knows how to divert a negative into a positive when she’s having a bad moment/day, calls her out on her bs and is low key a rom com lover!? I could go on but ultimately he was too adorable for words and such a book bfLizwas.. a teenager and a hopeless romantic like some of us. I adored her love for music and the playlists and her love for rom coms and how it solidified the bond she had with her mom as it reminded me of mines in doing so. But, I do have to mention being annoyed with her during certain points. delusional (aren’t we all) & oblivious at times with pent up teenage angst is how I’d describe her and while it bothered me at times—I understood her. Her unresolved grief and fear of things changing molded her into how she was which isn’t an excuse but I get it. Thankfully she was self aware enough to acknowledge how wrong her words and actions were and worked to change that bc she could be so petty. When she wasn’t doing the most, her delusions had me cracking up bc I somehow related to them years ago lmao. I also tried to put myself in her shoes and remember being horrible at communicating my feelings at her age so I hope thecharacter development shown is expanded on further in the sequel“Do you realize we could’ve been doing this for years if you weren’t such a pain in the ass?”wesliz- all the teasing on Wes’ end, the phone call scene, the late night talks in his backyard, the car scene (I screamed here) and confessing their feelings was the sweetest. They weren’t remotely close to enemies to lovers but who really is lol I overall found them adorable together and I wish Liz realized that sooner. idk if they’re gonna last going to college but I cannot wait for more of them and can’t help but hope they do so don’t mind me if you seeing mereading all the extra chaptersas I simply want more of Wes and his pov 🤭 anyways this was fun! and what I needed & I’m hoping this is one day adapted as a movie since it read like onesome quotes“Enemies-to-lovers- it's our trope, Buxbaum.”“The universe likes Wes better.”“Wow. That dress is so Liz Buxbaum.”“Buy the dress Liz, I’m begging you” after she sends him a picture of her prom dress 🥹“She's not you." “What?" “She. Isn't. You” I’ve seen this quote so much and now I get it 😩“I could say these unfiltered things to him because he didn’t care. Wes Bennett knew what a mess I was underneath it all, and there was a little bit of joy in knowing he saw the real me. Freedom.”“I wouldn’t run through a train station for Michael. But I would do it for Wes. Holy shit.”“I fell in love with teasing you in the second grade, when I first discovered that I could turn your cheeks pink with just a word. Then I fell in love with you.”-In need of a rom com that’scute and cliche?and that’ll make me feel like a teenager again lol I’m excited to meet the famous Wes
