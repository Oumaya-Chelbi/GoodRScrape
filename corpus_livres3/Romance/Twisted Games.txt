“If she couldn’t or wouldn’t fight for us—because of her guilt, her duty, her family, or any other reason—I’d fight enough for us both.”One word 5 letters LOVE I freaking loved this my gosh did this deliver. It was everything you could want from a bodyguard and princess romance: Angst, chemistry and lots of jealousy.Plot ✨“When I said “right,” she went left; when I said “leave,” she stayed.”Princess Bridget of Eledora just wants to live a normal college life that’s until her aggravating bodyguard comes into the picture. Now I don’t know what she finds more aggravating him being controlling or him being insanely attractive.Rhys Larson 😍“But first, I want to make one thing clear. From this point on, you’re mine. No other man touches you. If they do…” My fingers dug into her skin. “I know seventy-nine ways to kill a man, and I can make seventy of them look like an accident. Understand?”I just want to start of by saying I am in love with this man. He was everything any girls dream man. The way he could not stand any man getting near Bridget was the best form of entertainment any one could ask for. He never left Bridget and was ready to sacrifice it all just for her will always have my heart.Bridget 👑“I don’t break my promises, Mr. Larsen.” Bridget insisted on calling me by my last name the same way I insisted on calling her princess. It irritated us both, but neither of us would back down first. Story of our entire relationship”I can not fault her she was amazing the amount of power oozing out of her was insane. The way she refused to say Rhys and would say Mr Larson to piss him off will never get old 😂😭Everything I adored ❤️“Oh my God! Ava, are you bleeding?”Alex’s head snapped up. Less than five seconds later, he ended his call and crossed the room to a confused-looking Ava, whose hand froze halfway to the scones on the table.”“ It’s so much fun. It’s like playing with a windup toy.”1. Even though this has nothing to do with Bridget and Rhys I loved when Jules pretended Ava was hurt and nearly gave Alex a heart attack to prove he was whipped 😭😂“He walked to the bathroom, and without looking back, he added, “By the way, princess, the book is upside down.”2. Bridget reading her book upside down she was so real for that because if Rhys was there girl we’d all do the same thing 😩3. Rhys’s indoor part he planned for because gosh that was soooooo adorable 🥹4. Rhys knocking over the flower pot out of jealousy 😂😂😂5. The whole Costa Rica trip 🥰6. I loved the bonding between Alex and Bridget it was giving besties✨⚠️Spoilers Ahead ⚠️I’m sorry did anyone else nearly have a freaking heart attack because for a second like a second I thought that Bridget and Rhys were siblings I was about to throw up 🤢“My mother liked her belt,” he said flatly.”Just the whole Rhys and how his mum was abusive to him tore me up I can just imagine him washing up pretending that his mum didn’t die until it felt too real.😢“I was expecting your call.” I could practically see Alex Volkov’s smile over the phone, icy and humorless. “What can I do for you, Your Highness?”I was sooo proud of Bridget when she teamed up with Alex and blackmailed the speaker I was in awe like go girl ✨“What’s so funny?”“You and Andreas. You bicker like Nik and I do.” Her smile widened at the incomprehension on my face. “You bicker like siblings.”I LOVEDDD THE BOND BETWEEN RHYS AND HIS BROTHER ANDREAS LIKE DONT GET ME WRONG I HATED THE PRICK AT THE START BUT ONCE THEY FOUND OUT THEY WERE BROTHERS AND STARTED BICKERING IT FELT LIKE HE SOMEHOW WAS HEELING LITTLE RHYS 🥹⚠️Spoilers End Here⚠️Some of my favourite quotes:“Indoor festival,” he grunted.“You put this together.” It was a statement of disbelief more than a question.“Reluctantly, and with help.” Rhys glanced up. “Your redheaded friend is a menace.”not him lying when he set this whole thing up him self 😂“They’d only fluttered when we first met, but they’d died quickly after Rhys opened his mouth. ”I’m dead it’s giving most men 😂😭“If anything happened to her, I would murder Viggo. Slowly.”😂“Fuck pummeling his face. I wanted to knock all his teeth out.”common theme with Mr Larson 💀“Heard she went on a date today.”A vein pulsed in my forehead. First Andreas, now him. Why did every person insist on bringing that up? “I was there. But thank you for the breaking news.”The bastard laughed.”ahahaha I love this relationship between Christian and Rhys it’s giving Alex and Josh 😂😂“Bridget von Ascheberg was mine and mine alone. It didn’t matter that she wasn’t mine to take. I was taking her anyway, and if I could tattoo myself onto her skin, bury myself into her heart, and etch myself onto her soul, I would.”how romantic Rhys 😂“I told you, you’re mine, and I’m not letting you go. I don’t care if the entire Eldorran military tries to drag me away.”I loved how never backed down 😭“Pray you and Ava stay friends forever,”Alex casually threatening Jules 😂😂Now I just want to say I loved this but I’m not to sure if I’m going to like Josh and Jules book he just gives player I hope I’m wrong now on the other hand I can not wait for Stella and Christian love the little hints Ana left for us ✨“Christian stood in the shadows, chatting with Andreas, but his eyes strayed to something—someone—on the dance floor. I followed his gaze and winced when I saw Stella.”
