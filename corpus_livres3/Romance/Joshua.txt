BellaThe day my father killed my mother was the day I lost everything. I was taken away from the one man who owned every part of me. Twelve years later, I find myself on the run from the VP of the Celtic Renegades MC after watching him murder his father the President of the club. With nowhere to go and no one to help me, I go to the one place and person I can think of that has always meant safety to me. JoshuaThe day she was ripped from my life was the day my world turned upside down. She left with my heart in her hands. The one girl who could bring me to my knees with just a look. I've waited twelve years for her. Just hoping that she would someday find her way back to me. No other woman will ever come close to the beautiful redhead that could outshine a model even on her worst hair day.After twelve years they meet again. It would've been a joyous reunion if it wasn't for the guns they had pointed at each other's head. People want her dead and she will have to trust that the man before her in his "Storm Reaper's MC" kutte will protect her.Can he protect the woman he loves? Not only from this other MC club but from a greater threat that resides right in there own backyard. It all started with death and it will end with death. The question is, "Who's death will it end with?" Warning: Violence, Strong language, and Explicit sexual content.
