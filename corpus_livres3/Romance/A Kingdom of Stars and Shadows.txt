“If I knew how to do this, I would. If I knew how to love you without getting you hurt, I would never allow them to touch you again.”“Your family?”“Your enemies.”I picked this up thinking it'd be short and sexy, but it turns out it's not the case and that's a description that I can only apply to myself.🌠𝗔 𝗞𝗜𝗡𝗚𝗗𝗢𝗠 𝗢𝗙 𝗦𝗧𝗔𝗥𝗦 𝗔𝗡𝗗 𝗦𝗛𝗔𝗗𝗢𝗪𝗦 - 𝗕𝗬 𝗛𝗢𝗟𝗟𝗬 𝗥𝗘𝗡𝗘𝗘🌠★𝗬𝗔/𝗡𝗔/𝗔: 🆈🅰★𝗦𝗘𝗥𝗜𝗘𝗦: 𝚂𝚃𝙰𝚁𝚂 𝙰𝙽𝙳 𝚂𝙷𝙰𝙳𝙾𝚆𝚂 #𝟷★𝗙𝗜𝗡𝗔𝗟 𝗥𝗔𝗧𝗜𝗡𝗚𝗦: ⭐⭐★𝗚𝗘𝗡𝗥𝗘 𝗔𝗡𝗗 𝗨𝗡𝗗𝗘𝗥𝗧𝗢𝗡𝗘𝗦: 𝙵𝙰𝙽𝚃𝙰𝚂𝚈 - 𝙵𝙰𝙴 - 𝚅𝙰𝙼𝙿𝙸𝚁𝙴𝚂 - 𝚁𝙾𝙼𝙰𝙽𝙲𝙴★𝗣𝗢𝗩: 𝙵𝙸𝚁𝚂𝚃 𝙿𝙴𝚁𝚂𝙾𝙽 - 𝙿𝙰𝚂𝚃 𝚃𝙴𝙽𝚂𝙴★𝗧𝗥𝗢𝗣𝗘𝗦: 𝙲𝙷𝙾𝚂𝙴𝙽 𝙾𝙽𝙴 - 𝙴𝙽𝙴𝙼𝙸𝙴𝚂 𝚃𝙾 𝙻𝙾𝚅𝙴𝚁𝚂 - 𝙵𝙾𝚁𝙱𝙸𝙳𝙳𝙴𝙽 𝚁𝙾𝙼𝙰𝙽𝙲𝙴★𝗖𝗛𝗔𝗥𝗔𝗖𝗧𝗘𝗥𝗦: 👥👥/5★𝗪𝗥𝗜𝗧𝗜𝗡𝗚: ✍🏼✍🏼✍🏼/5★𝗣𝗟𝗢𝗧: 📜📜/5★𝗗𝗔𝗥𝗞 𝗧𝗛𝗘𝗠𝗘𝗦 & 𝗧𝗥𝗜𝗚𝗚𝗘𝗥 𝗪𝗔𝗥𝗡𝗜𝗡𝗚𝗦: 💀💀/5 (𝙵𝙾𝚁𝙲𝙴𝙳 𝙴𝙽𝙶𝙰𝙶𝙴𝙼𝙴𝙽𝚃 - 𝙱𝙻𝙾𝙾𝙳 - 𝙵𝙸𝙰𝙽𝙲𝙴 𝙵𝙴𝙴𝙳𝚂 𝙾𝙽 𝙼𝙲'𝚂 𝙱𝙻𝙾𝙾𝙳 𝚆𝙸𝚃𝙷𝙾𝚄𝚃 𝙷𝙴𝚁 𝙲𝙾𝙽𝚂𝙴𝙽𝚃)★𝗦𝗠𝗨𝗧 𝗤𝗨𝗔𝗟𝗜𝗧𝗬: 🔥🔥/5 (𝙻𝙾𝚂𝚂 𝙾𝙵 𝚅𝙸𝚁𝙶𝙸𝙽𝙸𝚃𝚈 - 𝙿𝙴𝚃𝚃𝙸𝙽𝙶 -𝙻𝙾𝚅𝙴 𝙸𝙽𝚃𝙴𝚁𝙴𝚂𝚃 𝙼𝙰𝚂𝚃𝚄𝚁𝙱𝙰𝚃𝙴𝚂 𝙵𝙼𝙲 𝚆𝙸𝚃𝙷 𝙰 𝙱𝙾𝙾𝙺)★𝗦𝗠𝗨𝗧 𝗜𝗡𝗧𝗘𝗡𝗦𝗜𝗧𝗬 & 𝗤𝗨𝗔𝗡𝗧𝗜𝗧𝗬: 🚒🚒🚒/5★𝗘𝗫𝗣𝗟𝗜𝗖𝗜𝗧𝗡𝗘𝗦𝗦: 🤐🤐🤐/5 (𝙵𝚄𝙲𝙺 𝙰𝙽𝙳 𝙸𝚃𝚂 𝙳𝙴𝚁𝙸𝚅𝙰𝚃𝙴𝚂 𝙰𝙿𝙿𝙴𝙰𝚁 𝟼𝟾 𝚃𝙸𝙼𝙴𝚂 - 𝙶𝚁𝙰𝙿𝙷𝙸𝙲 𝙳𝙴𝚂𝙲𝚁𝙸𝙿𝚃𝙸𝙾𝙽𝚂 𝙾𝙵 𝚂𝙴𝚇𝚄𝙰𝙻 𝚂𝙸𝚃𝚄𝙰𝚃𝙸𝙾𝙽𝚂)★𝗥𝗢𝗠𝗔𝗡𝗖𝗘: 🌹🌹/5★𝗟𝗢𝗩𝗘 𝗧𝗥𝗜𝗔𝗡𝗚𝗟𝗘: ❌ 𝙾𝙽𝙴-𝚂𝙸𝙳𝙴𝙳★𝗠𝗔𝗜𝗡 𝗥𝗢𝗠𝗔𝗡𝗖𝗘: 𝙵/𝙼★𝗘𝗡𝗘𝗠𝗜𝗘𝗦-𝗧𝗢-𝗟𝗢𝗩𝗘𝗥𝗦𝗡𝗘𝗦𝗦: 🖤/5 (𝚈𝙾𝚄 𝚆𝙸𝚂𝙷)▰▰▰▰▰▰▰▰▰▰▰▰Excuse the Leo humor, but if this wasn't the let down of the month, I don't know what it was.In the book's defense, it was rather short and a very quick read. It alsotriedvery hard to be sexy, but the more the author tried, the cringier it got, so I'll rule that one out.I wouldn't say AKOSAS (an acronym too pretty for a book so mediocre, in my humble opinion) is a bad book, it's just painfully underdeveloped.There's so little world-building and lore I was the John Travolta in Pulp Fiction gif the entire time I was reading this.What was happening? WHY was it happening? WHY SHOULD I BELIEVE IT WAS HAPPENING?WHAT IS THIS BOOK EVEN ABOUT???Who knows. Not me, that's for sure.And not the heroine, THAT'S FOR SURE.Seriously, for someone who's supposed to have this important task, this life that was controlled since birth and centered around a central role she was supposed to take, this lady knew very little of what was happening around her.And who can blame her. Lol.The characters felt so dull I couldn't pinpoint a single characteristic about either main character and her boyfriend-in-law if it was biting my ass. Heroine is just....ther. And Mister Love Interest tries too hard to be a bad boy. Even Jace WaylandLightwoodMorgensternHerondale was broodier than him, back in two thousand and cringe.The writing is average, although it had its peak in the first chapters, which mislead me into thinking this could be way better than it actually was.And the dialogues. My goodness, how unoriginal and trite they were.I swear, though, nothing prepared me for the mess that was the romance.So insta the characters fell in love and lust before the book was even written, the romance is so scripted and shallow you could tell me my 13-yo non-reader niece and her hormone-fueled bffs wrote it, and I'd absolutely believe you.It lacked the tension and angst that usually come with forbidden love between two people who are supposed to be enemies. Jesus Christ, Mister Love Interest dropped bombs about him falling to his knees for FMC in the second chapter.THE SECOND CHAPTER. And the first one was super short, so it counts like chapter 1 and a half.Their love was all tell and no show, but most importantly, it lacked motivation. Why would you consume yourself for someone so ardently when you've barely interacted and know nothing of the other? Why put into this "love" all of yourself when all you've said before to one another were just pleasantries and cringey innuendos?I wish I remembered to highlight the exchanges these two had before they started longing for each other in the way they were, because the notion would be scandalously embarrassing.The talking during the sex scene made me wanna cry. It was just THAT bad and basically a copy-paste of all the over the top, cussing-filled, cheesy lines you'll find on Wattpad.And of course the main character is a virgin superstar! I love smut with my books, but hate it when there's a virgin heroine who sucks dick like she patents for Hoover and whose body is a pleasure machine.I could overlook this, if at least it gave me some emotion. But nope, in tune with the romance, this gave me nothing except for a weird urge to re-readSea of Ruin.AND OMGLove Interest masturbates dear heroine with a book.Can you believe the disrespect???In short, this was a YA novel with fanfictionesque smut and characters so forgettable I actually forgotten their names as I wrote this review.Two stars and not one because it was very very fast-paced and the writing didn't suck completely.
