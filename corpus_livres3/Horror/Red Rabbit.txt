As their posse grows, so too does the danger.Racing along the drought-stricken plains in a stolen red stagecoach, they encounter monsters more wicked than witches lurking along the dusty trail.

Loving how the book is written2. Audiobook narration is greatWhat I Didn't Like:1. It ended too soon - can't it just go on forever üíÄOverall Thoughts:Oh my God I loved every aspect of this book. I loved that it was a western. I loved that there was magic to it. I loved that there were witches and there were ghouls and there was heart to it. The writing was so enthralling that I was along with them.Every character in this book added to the story. Not one character felt like they should have been left out or they were not needed. From the second I started reading this book I had to know where it was going.As a huge fan of westerns I feel like this book did something that I haven't really seen in movies or other books. It's hard to have a book that is a historical fiction not feel weighed down with just details and not feel boring. But somehow this book managed to keep your interest while still feeling for the characters. The fact that Sadie is painted as this terrible evil witch but then we come to find out that really she is the mother to Rabbit is just a twist I did not anticipate or see coming. Maybe that's a little naive but I think that's great storytelling because I wasn't even thinking about the end I was just enjoying the book as I was going.Loved the part about the cannibalism. I had a moment where I stopped reading and said ew.Final Thoughts:Cool just leave me here in tears with that ending. Oh my what an amazing story. If I could I'd give a million stars.Reading this book did kind of remind me of The Wizard of Oz but not in a bad way. It just made this book have heart.Recommend For:‚Ä¢ Westerns‚Ä¢ Witches‚Ä¢ Magical booksIG|BlogThanks to Netgalley, Macmillan Audio, and Tor Publishing for this advanced copy of the book & audiobook.
