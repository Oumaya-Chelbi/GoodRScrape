”It could force you to keep secrets that people would kill you for knowing. It could change the way you think and feel. It could really screw up your life.”“Screw up my life?” He stared at me for a second and then said, deadpan. “I’m a five-foot-three, thirty-seven-year-old, single, Jewish medical examiner who needs to pick up his lederhosen from the dry cleaners so that he can play in a one-man polka band at Oktoberfest tomorrow.” He pushed up his glasses with his forefinger, folded his arms, and said, “Do your worst.”Ohh Butters! You shouldn’t have tempted Harry like that! We all know he’s always true to his word and you’re no exception to the rule. Guess Harry did his worst after all or well, the horrible people our heroic wizard is fighting did. I’m pretty certain in future our friendly neighbourhood coroner will think about it twice before he’s throwing another challenge at Harry. XD I couldn’t help but like Butters though. He’s a really nice character and I hope to see more of him, even though I think he might disagree. As it seems he’s in it for the long haul with Harry though so I’m pretty certain there’s no turning back now.”If regular people can’t do it, and the Council won’t get involved, who the hell is going to stop him?”“I am,” I said.Right! As always our heroic wizard seems to be on his own and with Murphy out of the picture things seem to get even more heated than usual. (No pun intended, I swear! ;-P) Worst timing ever, but Murphy deserved a holiday even if it’s with Kincaid. I told you to grab that amazing woman as long as you could, Harry! Why are you so freaking stubborn? *lol* Let’s hope you’ll learn from that mistake and won’t be that foolish again. You know Thomas is right and even though he seemed like the irresponsible sort at first I think he might actually have a leg up when it comes to matters of the heart. (and wisdom!! He’s really very self-aware and intelligent.)”Little brother,” he said, “I simply cannot get over how stupid you are at times.”“Stupid? You just told me it was reasonable.”“Your excuses are,” Thomas said, “but love isn’t.”“We’re not in love!”“Never gonna be,” Thomas said, “if you keep being all logical about it.”YES Thomas! Someone had to tell him! XD In Harry’s defence: As always he has quite a lot to deal with and between the three necromaners Grevane, Crowl and Corpsetaker and their sidekicks Liver Spots, Kumori and Li Xian he’s more than just busy. Not to mention that old enemies like Mavra and a certain fallen angel show up in Chicago as well. He only has to figure out what’s up with the Erlking and how to stop them before the world goes to hell! Nothing new, right?!”In the past I hadn’t seen so many people hurt and killed and terrorized by the same kind of power that damn well should have been making the world a nicer place, or at the least staying the hell away from it. I hadn’t made so many mistakes back then, so many shortsighted decisions, some of which had cost people their lives. I had been sure of myself. I had been whole.”The good old times! Unfortunately Harry’s life has become pure chaos and with every book it gets even more dangerous and complicated. Of course he isn’t asking for trouble, it just always seems to find him. But don’t worry there are always some people that want to help him out and from Marcone up to Billy & Georgia right to two women named Shiela and Sue Harry has quite a lot of help. ;-PI knew something was wrong with Shiela!!! And it didn’t surprise me that she was actually Lasciel!!! After Billy’s reaction in Harry’s office I knew it for certain! Also Sue the dinosaur was so amazing! *lol* I loved that Harry revived her bones. It was so absurd it was hilarious. XDThe best assistant was Butters though and one of their interactions made for one of my favourite quotes of the Dresden Files so far:”Listen to me,” I snarled. “We are not going to die!”Butters stared up at me, pale, his eyes terrified. “We’re not?”“No. And do you know why?”He shook his head.”Because Thomas is too pretty to die. And because I’m too stubborn to die.” I hauled on the shirt even harder. “And most of all because tomorrow is Oktoberfest, Butters, and polka will never die.”I can’t!! *LOL* I’m still laughing like crazy because this is so accurate and funny!! Haha! It’s basically Thomas, Harry and Butters in a nutshell. And speaking of funny: I actually liked Ramirez as a character too and I hope we’ll see more of that cheeky wizard in future. He has some attitude and I kinda love him for it. Also it can’t hurt that Harry finally made some friends among the wizards. Heaven knows he needs all the support he can get in the White Council.I can’t believe the Wardens were almost wiped out! Like OMG!!! WTH?! I wonder if they’ll ever recover from that fight...”I’m brilliant as well as skilled,” he said modestly. “It’s a great burden, all of that on top of my angelic good looks. But I try to soldier on as best I can.”Still, Harry’s dark side is getting more and more prominent and I can’t help but wonder if he’ll lose the fight against it in one of the other books. He’s under a lot of pressure and every bad situation he gets into only seems to make it even harder to do the right thing. And not only that! The lines between good and bad are getting more and more blurry with each and every book as well. I kinda love how Butcher portrays that internal struggle and how he manages to tiptoe that fine line between right and wrong. There’s a lot of grey at the moment and it’s getting darker with each book. So I can’t help but wonder where Harry’s character is heading.”So once again, let me be perfectly clear. If anything happens to Murphy and I even think you had a hand in it, fuck right and wrong. If you touch her, I’m declaring war on you. Personally. I’m picking up every weapon I can get. And I’m using them to kill you. Horribly.”I mean he threatened Mavra and she was actually afraid of him! So this says a lot about how powerful and morally grey Harry is getting. Let’s hope we’ll never see his dark side because I’m sure it would be quite formidable and strong. >_<All told this was another great Harry Dresden book and I’m looking forward to borrow“Proven Guilty”from my library once it opens up again. ;-)_________________________________Oh wow! This was quite something! O_oI mean I'm used to Harry fighting against literally everything but *lol* this was really something else. XD These books are getting better and better and I get more and more worried about Harry...Full RTC soon! Stay tuned! ;-)___________________________So I figured since I already spoke about“The Dresden Files”in my lastBookTube video, I might as well continue to read the series. *lol*Yes, this is“Dead Beat”the seventh book I held into the cam. ;-)I really want to know how this series continues and what Harry Dresden will have to fight next. Judging by the blurb it will be vampires and necromancers? Sounds juicy! XDI’m ready for another round. ;-PFind me on:WordPress/BookTube
