Bloody Good!!For those of you who have no idea what with this book is about you should so below will be synopsis and then I’ll give my review because I got so excited I’m telling tha WORLD!***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS LATER IN REVIEW...Jk it contains spoilers***For nearly two decades, life in the small rural town of Silver Canyon had been peaceful and serene. People went about their daily lives as usual, completely oblivious to the inescapable horror that loomed on the horizon.All but a select few of Bane County’s residents had forgotten the macabre occurrences of the past. It was hard to believe that twenty-one people, missing or dead, in only three months’ time had been so easily dismissed.Bryce McNeel and Jackson Campbell had been at the heart of those horrific events, and the tragic memories of that long, bloody season still weighed heavily on them, especially since they knew it wasn’t over.The time was quickly approaching when a long-slumbering evil would reawaken, and the horrors of the past would revisit the people of Bane County. Somewhere within the dark cavernous depths of the wildlife refuge, something ravenous awaited, longing for its time to rise.As Bryce and Jackson prepared themselves, they were unaware that an even deadlier adversary would come for them, and once again, they would find themselves in a battle for their lives.**OK STOP! SERIOUSLY...I’M ABOUT TO TELL SOME STUFF...***Ok, so my review...First I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the cover. I think I fell in love with Jackson a little more in this book. I knew I would since I love the bad boy type characters so I was glad we saw a little more of him in this book. Swoon Worthy Jackson ladies!***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS...Jk it contains spoilers***The thing about this book was that it was more of a fast paced book compared to the first book. I was reading so fast that towards the end I was trying to slow down reading. I loved the idea of the development of the werewolf. I also like that there were numerous villains in this book, it made the book for me have more depth. Every time I feel like I know where the story is going it blasts me out the water with something new. Intense, heart pounding, and fist clenching is what comes to my mind when I read book 2. I can’t wait to continue to be immersed into this world further, So much so I am going to reread books 1&2 the week prior to book 3 coming out!! I’m so excited I need book 3 now!I recommend this series to anyone would loves wolves and love having their minds blown! Cause this will definitely do it.
