Really good short story collection that is best summed up as a central theme within a central theme for most of them. I'm a big fan of short stories and Moody does not disappoint--he should do more of them. He's an author though that I don't think should restrict himself to zombies at all either--there are a lot of horror topics he could cover.And all of these while zombies are basically the ENVIRONMENT, a very passive aggressive one. For the most part the zombies in Moody's stories are not exactly the frenetic brain eaters but living illnesss that just want to vomit or goo all over you and leave you alone once you're infected. This is a nice take on the genre, and one that in a way is more frightening than just getting torn limb from limb.Even when it's the conventional zombie, Moody is still original with it. Everyone (except a very few) drop down dead? Then the next day get up and get violent? Having that happen while in the middle of getting in trouble at work, dealing with being last survivor in a Twilight Zone-ish corpse city and then have that get worse? That story in particular had a very Day of the Triffids feel to it (ie., great), though Moody likes to namecheck Matheson.The last story with zombie POV easily one of the best I've read.
