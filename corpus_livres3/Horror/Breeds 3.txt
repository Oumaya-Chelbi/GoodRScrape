I can't review this book without spoilers so read at your own risk.This is book 3 and the series continues to go downhill. At the start of this book Morris knows absolutely and Kirk should know that the werewolf "elders" are tying to kill them. In spite of this Morris fails to plan AT ALL. Worse is the STUPID way Morris is killed: A young woman shows up at Morris's door asking to use his phone but, when Morris sticks his arm out the door to give it to her she refuses to come closer claiming Morris may be trying to lure her within reach to pull her into the cabin LIKE HE COULDN'T JUST COME OUT AN GRAB HER IF THAT WAS WHAT HE WANTED. WORSE, RATHER THAN JUST THROWING HER THE PHONE OR TELLING HER TO GO AWAY MORRIS KEEPS SCREWING AROUND UNTIL THE SNIPERS KILL HIM. ESSENTIALLY MORRIS' IS AN ABSOLUTE MORON FOR EVEN BEING IN HIS HOUSE WHEN HE KNOWS THE ELDERS WANT HIM DEAD, THIS WHOLE SCENE IS JUST BEYOND BELIEF STUPID.Kirk's story line is equally as stupid. Suspecting the elders are trying to kill him he lets a stranger into his home on the dumbest of pretexts, without even attempting to verify his cover story. Dumb luck that Kirk, feeling sorry for himself, keeps his blinds closed and stays inside so no sniper possibility. Dumb luck that Kirk gets the one assassin who can't kill him with a gun at point blank range. Then Kirk, the idiot, drives to Morris', the one place he should know the killers would get to ahead of him. Of course Kirk forgets to grab his phone or keys when fleeing his apartment because that would have made too much sense. Dumb luck that Kirk escapes the assassins at Morris'. Then Kirk begins a cross-country hike to his ex-girlfriend that is virtually nothing but dumb luck: Having to scavenge clothes, Kirk ends up dressed like a crazy person, yet he gets picked up hitchhiking. Then he injures himself and his super healing powers fail to come to his aid so he is taken in by a nice man who feeds and shelters him. Then, worse of all, and for no real reason, Kirk stupidly gets taken prisoner by a couple of normal humans who just so happen to be in the business of kidnapping and selling humans for their organs. This whole story line serves no real purpose- sure the author uses it to motivate Kirk to explore his werewolf powers but I would have thought running for his life could serve that purpose. No, this whole story line is contrived and stupid.After the organ harvesters, Kirk, connects with his ex and they finally do some intelligent things that amount to quickly and easily finding two elders, killing them and taking all their stuff.Bottom line: This book wasn't terrible to read because the scenes were well written but when the story is taken as a whole the MCs are morons and conclusion is bizarrely convenient.
