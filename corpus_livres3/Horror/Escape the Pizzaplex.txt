This book is alright, with a passable plot. The only strong dislike I have with the book is that it is very repetitive; every night has the same loop: the Pizzaplex closes, Gregory has something planned, Cassie plays along, the story gets interesting, then all interest is lost when it's one of Gregory's "pranks" and Cassie gets upset while the supposed "friend" laughs at her fear. The loop does end on Night 3, kinda, when "the Reagent" appears because instead of that loop, we get a new loop of Cassie being stuck in the Pizzaplex until the end of Night 5, adding a new threat with Gregory's torture methods, which might include Reagent based on the ending. This book has good, interesting parts; it just needed to be cleaned up or have a less repetitive plot.
