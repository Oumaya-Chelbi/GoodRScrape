"I am throwing awayWords. You and meIt's a good place to startWe got to lighten the loadCut down on what we carryToday I stop carryingYouTomorrow I'll stop carryingMe."Just a little bit more of buildup. Just a little bit more of setting the right pieces on the board.Just a bit more of listening to those selfish secrets and mysteries characters are trying to protect - until comes inFiddler,kicking with his rusty, old helmet, and everything starts to reveal itself.After eight books in the mainMalazan Book of the Fallenseries, and twenty four books overall - an end.And like Fiddler himself, you'll weep for asking too much.Story."He saw a rider ahead, a figure hunched and cowled as it waited astride a gaunt, grey horse from which no breath plumed. He saw a recurved Rhivi bow gripped in one bony hand, and he realized that he knew this rider.This Herald of War."We find theBonehuntersinLether,ready to march onKolanse,across theWastelandandGlass Desert,to their destiny. To challenge their fate, the unknown and the gods themselves.But, they are exhausted. And worse, they are bored.Adjunct Tavore Paranseems distant more than ever, and soldiers are starting to lose their faith in their commander.For the first time - after theFall of Aren;after their first victory was taken away from them inRaraku Desert;after they had paid a heavy price for their real first victory beneath the walls ofY'Ghatan;after their ownEmpresstook away the truth from them on the streets ofMalaz City;and after they have finally made the peace with themselves that on distant continent of Lether nobody will witness their true birth - Bonehunters are on the brink of mutiny.And they have yet to start a deathly march. To seemingly nowhere. To nothing but their death.While Malazan Army doesn't know what is it in Kolanse that Adjunct is hurrying to, other, ancient, forces in this world have a pretty good guess what awaits them there.So the run begins.Worldbuilding, History and Lore."Kneel to one or many, but never, never hold to a belief that but one god exists. Should you hold to such a belief, then by any path of reasoning that follows, you cannot but conclude that your one god is cursed, a thing of impossible aspirations and deafening injustice, whimsical in its cruelty, blind to mercy and devoid of pity."For the first time in this series we get inside of the point of view of reptilian dinosaur-look-like race known asK'Chain Che'Malle.And, oh my god(or gods in this case?),what a profound minds they are.So far, everything we have seen from them was physical superiority and monstrous brutality; this horde-like behavior against anyone who opposes them. And to be honest, in their badassery, they gave the sense of exactly that for which they were introduced to: a geek's dream come true.We have also learned that they were extremely intelligent species and we were led to believe that they were pretty much extinct."Humans, welcome us. The K'Chain Che'Malle have returned to the world."And here, in this book, we see their hierarchy, we see how they behave with each other and with other species, and we have our suspicions confirmed when we realize that they are indeed, not just on the brink of extinction, but that, what's left of the K'Chain Che'Malle's, have lost themselves.Not so much in their purpose - their purpose is to survive - as much as in the terms of their faith.Now, humans tend to believe howElder God K'rullis responsible for releasing magic into this world, when he cut his veins; but Che'Malle's believe that life itself is magical as is everything in it."When we kill the beasts living on this plain, when we close our jaws about the back of the neck. When we grip hard to choke off the wind pipe. When we do all this, we watch, with intimate compassion, with profound understanding, the light of life leave our victim's eyes. We see the struggle give away to acceptance, and in our souls, we weep."They also believe that, suitably, there are forces that work in opposition to this magic, this life, and that is naturally: death. But, in this battle of opposition between life and death, they form a balance. Balance that should not be compromised.Now, if you remember, in this world there's something calledOtataral.A rare, reddish ore, that negates magic.Che'Malles have on multiple occasions failed to move themselves from their stupor, so they have to turn to the only thing that was left to them, the only thing they still believe in: freedom of choice.And in that freedom they chose humanDestriantto show them their way.Yes. We might as well weep.Magic System."'One long scream of horror, Badalle. Ten thousand pages long. No one will hear it.''No,' she agreed. 'No one will hear it.''But you will write it anyway, won't you?''I am Badalle, and all I have is words.'"It's really hard to create a character and say to him:"You are powerful. And the way you'll express your powers is through: poems."- and not come out with something childish and cheesy.Children of the Snakeare refugees running from'Quitors',species that have ravaged their homeland.Somewhere along the way, in their exodus, their own parents tried to eat them when hunger struck, but they managed to escape from them and now there are children running across the wastelands.Soon to be very hungry."Pendulums Were Once Toys."One of the leaders of these children isBadalle,a child herself, who had a tendency to write and sing sad poetry. And through that poetry she would reflect on hardship they were going through.And even more importantly, she would find the meaning of words they have lost in that wandering; she had to create new ones in order to communicate about them.And yes, through your expressed emotions words can have power; if your words are eloquent enough they can have power.But how can you make words, in this world, stop a physical or a magical threat? To go even further, how can you yourself impose physical or magical power as a response - and not deviate from what we already learned of basic functioning of this world's magic and not introduce this as something that is far-fetched even in Malazan world?Her purpose in the story of the Snake is to show how incredibly powerful words can be even in the hands of a destitute child. Her words and her poetry are not only potent weapons against threats and foes but also as having the potential to reconstitute the existence and reality of the Snake."YIELD to your own lies!HALT in the breathless moment!Your lungs screamAnd silence answersYour heart drumsBrittle surfacesBLEED!"In a world devoid of purpose, meaning and direction for these children, where they have no authorities to consult or social structures to shape them and give them guidance and instruction, these kids cleave to Badalle's words and her poetry as the singular means of making sense of their world.Symbolism and Allegory."The Hobbling."A reminder why I cannot bring myself to likeKarsa Orlong.Without giving away any of the spoilers, I'll be very brief, because it's really hard to write about this topic. I won't be going into specifics, but I hope that you'll understand in-between the lines of which topic I'm talking about.It's extremely important to read this chapter. Be that on your first or fourth read, like mine.It is excruciatingly painful chapter to get through and on your first read you'll be shocked. Maybe you'll feel tempted to skip those pages - especially if you are a rereader - or to simply put book down and start cursing this author because, damn it, this is fantasy, and you're looking for an escape or a safe haven just for an hour or two from the real world.I completely understand if you decide not to, but I would like for you to stay. At least so that you could understand why Erikson did what he did and why he wrote this chapter and what he actually tried to achieve.There's a message here that Erikson tried to convey.There are certain monsters in this world. They walk among us. They talk to us, they smile at us, they behave just like everyone else. And we would never know, we would never see for what they are, until it's too late. We then catch them, sentence them and they rot. But, that's an ending to an already tragic tale.But, there are other kinds of monstrosities that happen in real world. Same in their nature. But still different. In these monstrous, backdoor, societies that exist in our world, sometimes society itself is so monstrous that they willingly participate. As part of their religious or cultural zeal. As part of their customs. They have existed through history, and they exist even today.And as it is in human nature to be shocked, to feel disgusted, to condemn and resent them - it is also in human nature to look away. To turn their heads."Oh my God, that's awful. Thank God, it didn't happen to me."Well, here, for couple of pages, for few paragraphs, nobody gets to look away.If this entire series is about anything at all - it is about compassion.And here, in this scenes, in this chapter, Steven implores you more than ever to show it.Which will just briefly bring me back to this monster Karsa Orlong again.While parts of the story he is in are indeed interesting(mostly because of the characters around him),Karsa Orlong himself is not.For me, he is not a bad-ass warrior. He is not an amazing character. I am unable and unwilling to define him by anything more than by his first act in the beginning of his story.I am not going to look away.Prose."The machinery wascoatedin oily dust thatgleamedin thedarknessas the faintglowof thelantern slidacross it,conveyingmotionwherenoneexisted,theillusionofsilentslippage,as ofreptilianscalesthatseamed,as ever, cruelly appropriate..."Am I the only one who sees a rhythm here? Am I reading too much into this? Let's try another paragraph then:"She could not find her way amount thecountlesstwistingcorridors,or through the vast chamber of silent, frozenmachines,evading the pits in thefloorsover whichflagstoneshad never beeninstalled,and staying clear of the metal andcablesspilling out fromunpanelled walls..."I don't know. Probably there is something there, given his history with constructing Kadaspala in Forge of DarknessDeconstructing Fiction (For Writers and Readers): Excerpt Deconstructed (1)and, just recently, his explanation on constructing The Siege of Pale in Gardens of the Moon.Deconstructing The Siege of Pale Aftermath Scene(I love his commentary on realizing just now that maybe we were overwhelmed with mini info-dumps. We were, Steven. We were.)Anyhow, as for the quoted paragraphs above: there probablyissomething, and while I'm definitely going around all of this completely wrong, painfully mistaking in my illiterate ignorance, it's quite amusing for me, a casual reader, to make notice of such details.3.58/5Kharkanas TrilogyForge of DarknessFall of LightPath to Ascendancy seriesDancer's LamentDeadhouse LandingMalazan Empire seriesNight Of KnivesReturn of the Crimson GuardStonewielderOrb Sceptre ThroneBlood and BoneAssailMalazan Book of the Fallen seriesGardens of the MoonDeadhouse GatesMemories of IceMidnight TidesHouse of ChainsThe BonehuntersReaper's GaleToll the HoundsUltimate Malazan Chronological Reading Order
