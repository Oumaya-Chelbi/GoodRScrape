➼5☆“Families are messy. Immortal families are eternally messy. Sometimes the best we can do is to remind each other that we're related for better or for worse...and try to keep the maiming and killing to a minimum.”🎧 —Ship in a bottlebyFin⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻ THIS ENTIRE SERIES IS A STRAIGHT UP FIVE STARS FOR ME HONESTLY.I don't even think I could rate it any less, like it's physically impossible for my fingers to press the 4. This book was absolutely no less from the first, perfect in every way. And, of course, the Percabeth content was the peak of the book 😋.rick'swritingwas amazing as always. Easy to understand and vibrant with magic. Making it from percy's point of view was his best decision honestly, because Percy and his thoughts make everything 10x better. The morals in this series are honestly so huge and powerful for a children's book, it kills me. Rick managed to write a book with the best humor and bind in such heavy topics so delicately. The writing is one of the best parts of this book.theworld-buildingissosimple. There's literally no complicated names or new piled information, and a majority of the setting was on a boat in the sea so... The relief of not having to know and pronounce complicated and new names is unbelievable.Seeing this different side to the Greek Gods' family was a fresh change. Hermes and how he tried to get to Luke and get him to turn back 😭🫶🏼. The perspective of looking into the Olympian family is so exciting to me honestly, it's what makes me the most excited and interested in this series. It's everything. Reading this series is so exciting for me, because I'm such a greek mythology geek. Seeing all this stuff about the gods and other things is so different. If you didn't like the storyline, well, the building of the gods and the Greek mythology kept you there. It's the best aspects in the series and one that never gets old honestly.all thecharacterswere so interesting to read about. Hermes to Chiron,you wanted to know more. Everyone was written with more than just looks, they haddepthto them, youconnectedwith them. Rick Riordan has a talent for making us more curious about everything no matter who or what it is. It honestly kills me, I sympathize and am curious about so many questionable characters that it's concerning 😭.Honestly, I was kinda scared to re-read this book because Thalia comes back in this one and I'm not exactly sure how I feel about her. I don't remember much about her since I read the series before a long time ago, but I had such mixed feelings about her. I'm praying I love her in the next book 🤞🏼.Why does no one ever believe Percy throughout this series? it pisses me off 😐. Clarissa is one of my favorite characters, whether she's questionable or not. Honestly, she was jut trying to prove herself, just like Percy. Sure, she's rude but i love her 🤭.Hermes trying to get Percy to change Luke and giving him advice was everything for me this book. It honestly made me wanna cry. You get to see more of Luke's childhood throughout this book and I love Luke a lot, because I get his reasons. The gods treated their children so unfairly. Sure, they're gods, but if you're gonna sleep with a human and then just ditch her child and not claim them? like how stupid and immature honestly. The gods continued to piss me off throughout this entire series and I honestly wish I could give some of them a fucking reality check.oh my god, when annabeth swam over the edge of the ship and he swam after her. The way he held her under the water 😭😭😭. yall,yall, how do i do thiss?? Him keeping the empathy link even though it might kill him so he would know if Grover was ever in trouble? I sobbed.⭒☆━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━☆⭒⭒☆━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━☆⭒𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 ‧₊˚✩彡𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐜𝐲 𝐉𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐬𝐨𝐧That was so completely unfair that I told Tantalus to go chase a donut, which didn't help his mood.percy the love of my fucking life omg 😭🫸🏼. You don't even understand how much I love this boy omg. My smart and brave baby 🫶🏼. His lines are everything, he made me cackle fr. The way he would destroypeople he didn't like in his thoughts, i'm crying 😭. The way he loved his friend so much that he would leave camp against orders, sneak onto a ship, jumpoffsaid ship, end up on an island, turn into aniguana pig, turn back human,steal a ship, sail in the sea, and save him from a giant sheep is literally gonna make me cry. Percy Jackson is one of the greenest book boyfriends you will ever read about. I literally adore him sm. If you can't like Percy, there's something genuinely wrong with you. The way that he cared about Annabeth and trusted Clarissa even though she tried to shove his face in a toilet, i love him so much my innocent perfect baby 🫶🏼.𝐀𝐧𝐧𝐚𝐛𝐞𝐭𝐡 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐬𝐞To a terrible moment, there was silence. Then Annabeth shouted, "You haven't learned to throw any better, either!"annabeth chase, the icon for all women. Me andedenwere literally just talking about how absolutely amazing this girl is. She's literally one of the strongest girls ever. She's went through so much and lost so many it's heartbreaking. My smart girl ❤️‍🩹. She's literally everything. There's just something about this girl that just tells you she's perfect in ever single sense, i adore her. She's so badass and funny, ugh! Her plans, her lines, her everything. The way she watched percy through his bedroom window, CRYING 😭🫸🏼. sounds terrible out of context, but i swear she's not a stalker yall 😔. I kinda hate how she was mean to Tyson, but I totally understand where she was coming from. Best girl fr 😩.𝐎𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬Grover wasn't in this one as much, but my goat boy ate as always!! The empathy was so smart, I would probably forgot I had it and start throwing my shoes at the giant sheep guy who's name I can't spell 😔🫸🏼. Luke... I love him yall. He was just lead down the wrong path 😕🫶🏼. Clarissa the loml, i love her honestly she's everything. Especially in the later books!!𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐜𝐚𝐛𝐞𝐭𝐡AHHHHH OMGOMGOMG, THESE TWO GUYSS 😭. He jumped after her when she jumped overboard then held her underwater and let her cry into his shoulder 😭🫶🏼.He kept a picture of her in his notebook, omggg in absolute love with these two. Their bickering was absolute heaven, they're perfect in everyway 🥹❤️‍🩹.⭒☆━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━☆⭒⭒☆━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━☆⭒𝗳𝗮𝘃𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗲 𝗾𝘂𝗼𝘁𝗲𝘀/𝘀𝗰𝗲𝗻𝗲𝘀 ‧₊˚✩彡✉“The real story of the Fleece: there were these two children of Zeus, Cadmus and Europa, okay? They were about to get offered up as human sacrifices, when they prayed to Zeus to save them. So Zeus sent this magical flying ram with golden wool, which picked them up in Greece and carried them all the way to Colchis in Asia Minor. Well, actually it carried Cadmus. Europa fell off and died along the way, but that's not important.""It was probably important to her.”➸ IM CRYINGGG, PERCY 😭😭✉We only came close to dying six or seven times, which I thought was pretty good. Once, I lost my grip and found myself dangling by one hand from a ledge fifty feet above the rocky surf. But I found another handhold and kept climbing. A minute later Annabeth hit a slippery patch of moss and her foot slipped. Fortunately, she found something else to put it against. Unfortunately, that something was my face."Sorry," she murrmured."S'okay," I grunted, though I'd never really wanted to know what Annabeth's sneaker tasted like.➸ I'm literally in love with them 😩💗✉“You weren't able to talk sense into him?""Well, we kind of tried to kill each other in a duel to the death.""I see. You tried the diplomatic approach.”➸ BYEEE ALKLAKJSDLKASJD 🫸🏼🫸🏼✉Before I could figure out how to apologize for being such an idiot, she tackled me with a hug, then pulled away just as quickly. "I'm glad you're not a guinea pig.""Me, too." I hoped my face wasn't as red as it felt.➸ my heartt 😩🫸🏼✉I couldn't believe I'd come this far, lost Tyson, suffered through so much, only to fail - stopped by a big stupid monster in a baby-blue tuxedo kilt. Nobody was going to swat down my friends like that! I mean...nobody, not Nobody. Ah, you know what I mean.➸ BYE ILHSM 😭🫶🏼✉“Does truth have a moral?”✉Mythologically speaking, if there's anything I hate worse than trios of old ladies, it's bulls. Last summer, I fought the Minotaur on top of Half-Blood Hill. This time what I saw up there was even worse: two bulls. And not just regular bulls - bronze ones the size of elephants. And even that wasn't bad enough. Naturally they had to breathe fire, too.➸ mood tbh 😔✉Ever come home and found your room messed up? Like some helpful person (hi, Mom) has tried to "clean" it, and suddenly you can't find anything? And even if nothing is missing, you get that creepy feeling like somebody's been looking through your private stuff and dusting everything with lemon furniture polish?➸ percy really said: for may's mom 🫸🏼🫸🏼🫸🏼✉“Powdered donuts," Tyson said earnestly. "I will look for powdered donuts in the wilderness." He headed outside and started calling, "Here, donuts!”➸ TYSONNN, HE'S SUCH A CUTIE I LOVE HIM 🥹🫶🏼✉Tantalus made a wild grab, but the marshmallow committed suicide, diving into the flames.➸ bye alkdjaslkdjioewr 😭😭😭😭😭✉"The moral?" Hermes asked. "Goodness, you act like it's a fable. It's a true story. Does truth have a moral?""Um ...""How about this: stealing is not always bad?""I don't think my mom would like that moral."➸ I LVOE THIS BOY SO MUCH 🤗✉Thalia had been turned into a pine tree when she was 12. Me... well, i was doing my best not to follow her example. I had nightmares about what Poseidon might turn me into if i were ever in the verge of death—plankton, maybe. Or a floating patch of kelp.➸ bye my poor bb LKJASDLKASDJ✉“Don't untie me," she said, "no matter what happens or how much I plead. I'll want to go straight over the edge and drown myself.""Are you trying to tempt me?""Ha-ha.”➸ THEM, JUST THEMM 😋✉I'd missed Annabeth probably more than I wanted to admit.➸ 😭💗✉THAT Perseus always won. That's why my mom had named me after him, even if he was son of Zeus and I was son of Poseidon. The original Perseus was one of the only heroes in the Greek myths who got a happy ending. The others died-betrayed, mauled, mutilated, poisoned, or cursed by the gods. My mom hoped i would inherit Perseus's luck. Judging by how my life was going so far, i wasn't too optimistic.➸ bye 😭🫸🏼✉“Don't you ever feel that way? Like you could do a better job if you ran the world?"'Um... no. Me running the world would be kind of a nightmare.”➸ ALJKDSAKLSOIEWR 😭😭✉“Okay," Annabeth said. "What exactly do you smell?""Something bad," Tyson answered."Great," Annabeth grumbled. "That clears it up.”➸ BYE I LVOE HER 💗😭✉“Tyson! Thank the gods, Annabeth is hurt!""You thank the gods that she is hurt?" he asked, puzzled.➸ LAKSJDALSKDJ TYSON 😭😭⭒☆━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━☆⭒⭒☆━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━☆⭒𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗹𝗶𝘀𝘁 ‧₊˚✩彡Ship in a bottlebyFin❝Sailing on a ship in a bottleAnchor all your thoughts to the bottomPulling ropes and pulling your head backTo see what is breaking the foremastYou set sail alone, there is no crewNo one on the deck who can help youThis is all your own battle to winThis is your ship and you are the captain❞Achilles come downbyGang of youths❝Loathe the way they light candles in RomeBut love the sweet air of the votivesHurt and grieve but don't suffer aloneEngage with the pain as a motiveToday, of all days, seeHow the most dangerous thing is to loveHow you will heal and you'll rise above❞ I LOVE THIS SONG SO MUCH, YOU DON'T EVEN UNDERSTANDAncient dreams in a modern landbyMARINA❝I am not my body, not my mind or my brain (ha)Not my thoughts or feelings, I am not my DNAI am the observer, I'm a witness of lifeI live in the space between the stars and the skyWhat's your purpose, why were you put on Earth?You could be lost but you belong to the worldWe're now living in a seminal ageThe walls are being broken and we're ready for change❞ControlbyHalsey❝I paced around for hours on emptyI jumped at the slightest of soundsAnd I couldn't stand the person inside meI turned all the mirrors aroundI'm bigger than my bodyI'm colder than this homeI'm meaner than my demonsI'm bigger than these bones❞House of memoriesbyThe neighborhood❝Heart to heart and eyes to eyesIs this taboo?Baby, we built this house on memoriesTake my picture now, shake it 'til you see itAnd when your fantasies become your legacyPromise me a place in your house of memories❞Mythological beautybyBig thief❝If you wanna leaveYou just have to sayYou're all caught up insideBut you know the wayYou're all caught up insideBut you know the way❞Achilles heelbyJ.
