This review is going be the longest one I've ever written here. Everyone should read this book at least once in their life despite whether they are a reader or not. You may ask why? No worries, that's why ✨I'M HERE✨ to convince you because that's my job 😌✋🏻 TWs mentioned at the end of the review, so make sure to read it ⚠️This book deserves every star of this universe 😭💫 I don't know where I should begin with, there are no words to describe or that would amount to how much this book means to me. I feel hollow inside yet so full of emotions at the same time like I was the last two years. This book is that book that makes you wish you could keep turning the pages even after you finished it long ago. This can painfully and beautifully break something inside you that you never thought existed before 🥺❤️‍🩹 I haven't found a book yet that can take the place of this one in my heart. You feel for the characters immensely, and you live through the characters experiencing all the emotions, hope, and love amidst the violence. I thought when rereading this for the third time again, I would never cry because I already knew what happens in each chapter, but oh boy, I was wrong. This is the only book that can make me cry always and touch my soul deeply every time 💓what to expect 💌:🍋 Pharmacist x Animator🍋 Halal Romance🍋 Found Family🍋 Dystopian🍋 HEA (still bittersweet)🍋 Two best friends who are more like sisters🍋 Soul mates (meant for each other)🍋 Studio Ghibli movies mentioned🍋 Resistance, hope, survival and love🍋 Dealing with grief🍋 Takes place in Syrian War~🍋“No one will remember our names. No one will know our story.”🍋~This might be a fictional imagination, an ink sprawled on pages, but what's written here is happening in real-time, in real life as many people's reality while I'm writing this review. When I picked up this book at the mark of two months to Gaza's genocide for the first time back in 2023, I knew very well there's gonna be all sorts of emotions, and that's what I was looking for as well- I needed to experience everything in a single book. I'm glad this book surpassed all my expectations- I giggled, cried, sobbed, became sad, and then happy on repeat while reading this book🥹🫶🏻.There is always this constant feeling inside us, i.e., fear of dying. It might sound cliché, but it's present inside every one of us. The people we see today might not be there tomorrow and vice versa. Without fear, emotions can't exist. And you might ask why am I suddenly speaking of the word 'fear'? Because this is one of the overarching themes of this book.~🍋“But no matter how many times I see it, no amount of warning can prepare me for the sight of a human struggling for breath. This is not normal, and it never will be.”🍋~Let's take a moment to imagine what life would be like to live in constant fear, in a country, where bombs are dropped from everywhere, and there is no safe place to go, not even your very own home is safe for you any longer. It's like living in a dystopian world right? Everywhere you see is blood, limbs scattered, people screaming under the rubble to be saved, children orphaned and shivering, people mourning their lost loved ones. You don't want to die. You just want to live a normal life like anyone. You fear you might not live to see the next sunrise/sunset. You fear for your loved ones' lives. You don't want to be separated from them. If you die, you want to die together, so nobody is left alone to face this cruelty anymore. This is what fear is, it gears our emotions, and it drives us to make sometimes irrational decisions. Death teaches us many things.~🍋“For every life I can’t save during my shift, one more drop of blood becomes a part of me.”🍋~All the characters in this book have touched me in so many ways. Each one of them gives you something to walk away with ❤️‍🩹 Salama Kassab taught me how to live with fear; Kenan Aljendi taught me how to fight for what I believe in through his faith, caring nature, kindness, hopefulness, and gentleness toward Salama, making her see the colors she once thought she would never see in Syria again; Layla was the most precious, she taught me how to see light even in the darkness of this world 🥺; Hamza taught me the importance of resilience and Dr. Ziad taught me to keep faith in God and move forward, to never give up.Kenan was Pazu to Salama, and Salama was his Sheeta🥹I swooned over their bantersTheir chemistry was out of the world 😩❤️‍🔥 We all deserve a Kenan in our lives too and I hope we all get one, Insha Allah 🥰🤍Me the whole time when Kenan appears, breathes, and speaks:~🍋“Insh’Allah, we will come back home. We will plant new lemon trees. We’ll rebuild our cities, and we will be free.”🍋~Love, hope, and dreams are what we hold onto when things get difficult.Zoulfa Katouhdid an amazing job showcasing every aspect of emotions in this book 👏🏻 There was so much love between Kenan and Salama. Despite going through turmoils- physically and mentally, they still held onto each other. The love they had for their country, their families, and in the hope they had for their future & their land Syria is soo very beautiful.~🍋“This is my land, and just like the lemon trees that have been growing here for centuries, spilled blood won’t stop us. I have my faith in God. He’ll protect me. I’ve been force-fed oppression, but I will no longer swallow its bitter taste. No matter what.”🍋~Throughout this whole book, it made me see a whole lot more- I can't put it into words. Whether Syrians or Palestinians or Sudanese, seeing their unshakable faith in the Almighty has shaken my faith. If they are God's chosen people for heaven-where do we stand then?A question I ask myself every day.If you've read till here, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your patience, love, and support. I hope you will give this book a chance and fall in love with Salama & Kenan 🥰💐💗Special thank you to my besties irl,Shaz & Fizzyfor reading this with me the first time around, giggling, flirting like Kenan with each other, and crying together in the messages. I love you both so much. I'm so glad I convinced you both to read this and had you both with me (I'm sorry not sorry for dragging you both in the emotional rollercoaster) 🤭💝Salama&Kenan, Layla&Hamza, Lama, Yusuf, Dr. Ziad, Ahmad, and Nour- these characters are forever etched in my heart and I'll carry them with me wherever I go throughout my life 🥺💘 Believe me when I say this, I will be rereading this book many more times in the future every year and recommend this to everyone I interact with non-stop as long as I live 😌🤍౨🍋ৎ“Every lemon will bring forth a child and the lemons will never die out.”౨🍋ৎTRIGGER WARNINGS:war and violence, parental deaths (on page), sexual assault (on page), murder, child abuse, torture, starvation, ptsd, grief, hallucinations, and a lot of giggling + crying, so be ready with your tissue box, you'll need it besties!💕⚠🚨SPOILERS AHEAD🚨⚠❥𝓢𝓸𝓶𝓮 𝓸𝓯 𝓶𝔂 𝓯𝓪𝓿 𝓶𝓸𝓶𝓮𝓷𝓽𝓼 𝓸𝓯 𝓢𝓪𝓵𝓪𝓶𝓪 & 𝓚𝓮𝓷𝓪𝓷💞:“I’m pretty sure my parents’ souls are glaring at me from Heaven right now for accepting.

Forget everyone.”“You probably don’t know this, but I’ve loved you from the moment you were in my home, wild-eyed and scared, and saving a life. I thought I couldn’t love you more than I loved you that day. Then I thought that the next day. And the next. And the next. Until every thought began and ended with you. All my dreams were of you. I wanted to love you in Homs more than the time we were given. I wanted to love you in a home we built on our land.”“You were sitting on the balcony, looking up at the sky and all I could see was the back of your head, but I knew you were smiling. And I realized in that moment, as random as it was, that you are home. ”“You are my home. You are all my happiness. You are all my colors. I only see them with you. ”ˏˋ°•*⁀➷・❥・𝓟𝓻𝓮𝓿𝓲𝓮𝔀・❥・ˏˋ°•*⁀➷⤿💌15/03/25rtc soonafter I go stare at the wall for hours again, polish my old review & add new things because I read the bonus contents this time.
