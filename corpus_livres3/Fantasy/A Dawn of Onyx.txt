I was provided a copy of the book by the author in exchange for an honest review. All thoughts and opinions are my own.✅ Captor / Captive✅ Sexual tension✅ Kind of hate to love / No insta-love!!✅ “Who did this to you?”✅ Walking in while she’s in the bath✅ There is only one horse✅ Magic / Healer✅ Pace and plot✅ World-building✅ Twists and secrets (and some betrayal)Strong 4.5 stars_______________________Second read:I noticed some aspects of the plot that were a little weaker this time around, but it was still an addictive and engaging read, and I am so glad I got an ARC of the second book, so I can start it right away!_______________________Wow, I was excited to read this book and hoped it would be as good as the blurb promised, but I was not expecting it to be this good and addictive! I got sucked in from the very first chapter and just couldn’t stop! I had a bad syndrome of “just one more chapter with this one”!Now would be a great time for that optimism I’d been told I had in spades.But I feared there was no positive spin for flying via massive, horned dragon as a prisoner into enemy territory. I looked down at the land below me, cloaked in darkness, and watched the only life I’d ever known disappear from sight.Arwen spent her whole life in her small village, caring for her sick mother, and secretly using her healing power to help her people. The past year has been rough for her mother, her younger sister, and her because her brother was forced to enroll in the army to fight against their enemy from the kingdom of Onyx. When Arwen’s brother unexpectedly comes back with stolen Onyx gold, they only have a few minutes to pack up and leave for another kingdom where there is no war, before Onyx’s soldiers catch up to them. Everything does not go according to plan, and Arwen finds herself a prisoner of the Onyx army. She ends up first in prison and then forced to work as a healer for Onyx, and that is how she meets the famous and feared king Kane Ravenwood.Arwen is such a lovable and relatable main character! She is strong, resilient, and driven, but also flawed and not amazingly good at everything she does as soon as she tries it. She is kind and intelligent, while also being snarky and fierce. Overall, she felt very human and real. She is thrown into a new country with her enemies surrounding her, and she is afraid, but that’s where her strength shows and her bravery shines. There was a time or two when she made choices or had reactions that annoyed me a little, mostly when she acted like a jealous teenager wanting to mark her territory with Kane, even though they were not involved romantically or physically together, but as I said, she is not perfect and I like that about her. Besides those few rare instances, she was amazing and I can’t wait to see more of her and see how she continues to grow and gain confidence in the next book.“You met King Kane Ravenwood? And spoke to him? What was he like?”“Horrible,” I snapped. “And miserably handsome. An awful combination.”“You’re hurt. Why didn’t you say something?”“It’s nothing, just a bruise.”Anger simmered in his eyes. “Who did this to you?”I love Kane, he is a great character and love interest. He is protective, but not over the top and too controlling, and he is very devoted to Arwen and her happiness. He supports her and her ambitions, and he encourages her to become better, stronger, and be able to defend herself instead of just deciding that he will be in charge of protecting her. His support and the way he treats Arwen as a valued equal were very attractive. Much more than just being gorgeous and having a 6 pack and a chiseled jaw, as is sadly often the case in YA or NA romances. I also love that Kane has a manipulative side and that he has to lie and keep putting his kingdom first, that even if he is attracted to Arwen, he can’t allow himself to get involved with her, and he has to deceive her at times. It created some tension, especially near the end of the book, and the sequel promises to have some drama and groveling so I am very excited to read it.I had never been so outspoken with anyone in my life. I hated him, I didn’t respect him, I didn’t trust him, and I could not for the life of me keep my thoughts off him and his smug, cruel words.“I love to listen to you explain medicinal practices,” he purred.“And I’d love to listen to you fall off a cliff.”“What do you want? I have a patient to tend to.” I hoped my breathy voice might be accredited to shock.“You’ve been avoiding me.”I swore steam was curling out of my ears “Could you be any more self-obsessed? This man is dying.”I loved the romance in this book. It’s a slow burn full of sexual tension and sassy banter. I do love the “captive in the enemy hold” trope because it often goes hand in hand with a hate-to-love romance. Sadly it too often ends up with insta-love, but not in this book! Arwen truly despises the King, not only because of the rumors she heard about him but also because of his behavior toward her, and his lies. Honestly, their relationship reminded me a little bit of Rhysand and Feyre in ACOTAR and the first part of ACOMAF. Kane doesn’t hate Arwen, he is intrigued and interested in her, but she is afraid of him and hates him because of his bad reputation, and because he goads her and pushes her buttons every time they interact. What would have made it even better would have been a dual point of view. I was dying to know what was going on in Kane’s head, but at the same time, us not knowing allowed the author to give Kane a hidden agenda that wasn’t revealed until the end, and I liked that too.Mari is also a great secondary character who had a use besides supporting the main character in her quest. She is fiery and bubbly, and I really loved her too. Overall, the characters were all well developed and fleshed out, and the author did a great job with the dynamics and the relationships developing in this book, but she also left room for more relationship-building and more character development in the next book. Griffin is also a secondary character that intrigued me, and I am curious to see more of him and his grumpy behavior with Arwen (I am also shipping him and Mari).Halden’s storyline felt weaker now that I am reading this for the second time and could focus more on the details, or maybe it’s more that there is a lack of backstory there. He didn’t want to fight at first and was forced to enroll in the army 2 years ago, and now he is part of one of the King’s secret elite groups. How did that happen? Why was he chosen when he didn’t care about the war? I would have needed more details to truly believe his story and be more invested in his plotline and how it affected Arwen. I hope we will get those details in the next book if he is still a part of the plot.This book was mostly about Arwen trying to survive the predicament she found herself in and trying to thrive in her new environment, but the next book will clearly be more about her taking her destiny into her own hands, and even being in charge of what happens to a certain extent, instead of letting Kane decide of her fate because he is the King. I am very curious to see how her relationship with Kane will progress. There was a lot of flirting and sexual tension between them in this book, but not a lot of smut (I am not complaining), so it built up even more sexual tension and now I am eager for them to do something about it too, but with the way things were left between the two of them at the end of this book, I am not sure love will be in the air at the beginning of the second book (and the angst-lover in me is overjoyed by the promise of angsty groveling).Follow me on Instagram🙂
