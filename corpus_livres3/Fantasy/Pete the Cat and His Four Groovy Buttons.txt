I love Pete! I got this one for my grandson, who is 5. I have bought him a few Pete the Cat books so it took me until the second one to realize that he sings a song in every book. You can go to the publishers website (Harper Collins) or You Tube to pull up the songs being sung by the author which helps to know the actual tune. Otherwise you’re scrambling to come up with one of your own. Which is fine, kiddos don’t care, but I liked the actual song much better than my own.Anyway, what I love about the Pete books:in each one, Pete has a problem, but instead of getting all unraveled over the problem, he just takes it in stride and sings a song. As an adult, I NEED TO FOLLOW PETE’S ADVICE, because I get too spun up over little things. Pete is carefree and fun.I appreciated how the books repeat lines so towards the end, my grandson was saying the lines with me.The illustrations were whimsical, colorful and very appealing to children and adults alike.
