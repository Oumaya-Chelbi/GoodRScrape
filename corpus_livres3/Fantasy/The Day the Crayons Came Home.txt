What I like most about Drew Daywalt and Oliver Jeffers The Day The Crayons Came Home is how freakin‚Äô utterly hilarious this book is.By Tan, I was laughing so hard I had to stop reading to catch my breath.Esteban the Magnificent popping in along this journey in stand up comedy terms is dubbed ‚Äùa callback‚Äù. I'm in love with this little guy. BUT you‚Äôll have to read the book with a little to find out which color he is.Poor Tan (teaser alert) can't tell what color it is anymore, ‚ÄùHave you ever been eaten by a dog and puked up on the living room rug? Because I have... ‚Äù ü§£ü§£ü§£This poor little remainder of what used to be a beloved brand new crayon is beyond humiliated.Drew and Oliver have given me new author goals. I hope my series shared by me will insight belly laughs as much as this book has.I've read a LOT of children‚Äôs books to students. Adding personality. Such as Sandra Boynton‚Äôs Barnyard Dance with me doing a Square Dance style caller while dancing as a square dancer would always make the children laugh. Even older students.This inspired an idea for an activity, everyone picks a crayon and perform the plot. While attempting to read the parts. I'm falling on the floor laughing imagining this in real life occurring already.Better yet, have the children make their crayon costumes. To make it fair because everyone will want to perform, make groups of children be different colors, and write their silly parts OR divide the class into the number of colors for this book. Then, put them into book groups. Each group will memorize and act out their color.Plus, you can have a group of children draw the postcards and act as a postcard, too. Play the game, ‚ÄùWhere in the world is Neon Red Crayon?‚Äù Read to see why this question works for a geography and social studies exploration.So many ways to go about this creatively. Decide the education themes for what categories. Such as, we are studying: art, social studies, and also discuss the postal system and geography.Cross-curriculum will make this a very fun way to learn about many interesting places.If there are people who want to be more than one color or assignment there's no reason why children can't try different roles. This gives them a diversity of experiences and helps them explore how we do throughout our education as we get older.Even in college, we have mandatory classes on topics we will never use ever. But, are forced to take, pay for, and master to get value according to the standards required. If we want a diploma. While guiding us to our true path.Like, for me ending up here sharing with you. Began illiterate. Struggling was discouraged by my first college English teacher, ‚ÄùYou‚Äôre not college material‚Äù.Joined the military full time and studied hard to improve reading, vocabulary, and took easier college classes like library studies and typing.Finally, in four years mastered the craft of reading and writing enough to return to college full time while being in the military part-time.Still working hard to improve literacy along the way. Graduated with elementary education and later early childhood certification where I earned a 4.0 because in my heart want to be the best for those I'm working toward being an empathetic author to this beautiful world of children.Beginning with children from the get go, we can mentor them to see they can be anyone they wanna be, BUT this might not always be an easy journey.Along the way when bumps happen can hurdle their difficulties, like the crayons, will find their way when they put their minds to the task and work hard to get to where they wanna be. If I can do it, I'm sure any little can.Especially when they have caring adults like you to support them with cool books and activities to help develop their brains, choices, and creativity along the way.We can help children prepare for these roads in life in fun ways as littles since they'll explore options and learn to pick a favorite. How else do we know it's our preference until we try things we don't like as well?This books takes me back to my teaching days. When I met my first group of crayons in the original, the Day the Crayons Quit. This sequel is funnier to me as I don't remember laughing as hard while surrounded by students. I'm alone reading to review cracking up. So I know this is real hilarity as I'm a grown-up in my 50‚Äôs.Who says we're ever too old to read a children‚Äôs book is clueless of its joy at any age. Especially for an aspiring children‚Äôs series writer üòäBorrowed from the library on the Overdrive app. The version was delivered to my Kindle.What I learned is this particular book on kindle sucks if you've never used a Kindle before. Because the postcards are written in crayon I couldn't see the tiny print well.It took an accident of fate to figure out if I tap the page twice segments of the text will pop out. Then, I have to tap twice again for the next section to pop out to read. And so on. Including to see small non-crayon writing.This style book is preferred in the paper version for me for sure. It's so good I'm buying a copy to do a verified review on Amazon. And, if I'm fortunate enough to ever have grandkids this is so being passed down to them.As grown as my son is in his late 20‚Äôs and recently married, I'm even thinking of reading it to him because he'll crack up.Books have always been our thing as a family. This definitely would have been one of our favorites. Who knows, can still be someday üòÇFavorite highlights for me, although there could be some you identify can add to this review on Goodreads or elsewhere: using untypical colors personified. Comedic callbacks as previously touched on. Engaging the different theme potential for cross-curriculum exploration. Hilarity on steroids.Almost forgot, science exploration is possible as the story mentions the sun and a conundrum two color's face who use to argue until... Read to find out more. Poor yellow and orange.The list of favorite highlights is SO LONG Imma have to encourage you to read and see for yourself.I'm not sure why while reading the postcards from the various colors did each show up in a different audible voice in my head. As though I can hear their personalities. This, for me, is the greatest beauty of all the highlights and attributes of this classic.Another book on colors for young children is Mary O‚ÄôNeill‚Äôs Hailstones and Halibut Bones: Adventures in Poetry and Color. In this book the story was developed, and if you've heard the backstory, was made into a book by accident. Eventually being used to help blind people ‚Äùsee‚Äù color.If I recollect correctly, the publisher stopped by and asked about Mary‚Äôs writing and she gave permission to look through her notes. Like lots of writers Mary collected pieces of paper with lots of notes. Within the piles were vivid descriptions of colors using foods to things like trees.Like, roast beef could represent brown and so on.Compiled, these scraps of descriptions formed a book that now makes the world a more lovely place to see through the imaginations of blind people everywhere who read.The illustrations are beautiful for us sighted folks, too.Overall, this or other children‚Äôs books from Drew and Oliver are a silly way to engage children creatively. Well worth a borrow from the library or purchase for a gift.Once finished, share snacks and discuss open-ended questions about personification and made-up personalities of the colors.The final activity at the end the book is explore two skills: empathy and kindness. Qualities the world ALWAYS needs every day.Compare how Duncan realized his choices hurt his crayons and how he solved these problems.Ask questions of the children on what some of their problems are and discover ways that work and don't to make models of future options that will help the littles be successful decision makers and treat their friends and belongings with more respect and understanding.Ask children to pick a color and make up a story about the color from how they'd imagine they would feel if left behind, or forgotten in a pocket only to end up in the dryer, used a lot, or a little. The possibilities for open ended questions transformed into projects is endless with this series.The possibilities are unlimited on where these answers can lead children.‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔøΩÔøΩ‚≠êÔ∏è üíØ‚ù§Ô∏è
