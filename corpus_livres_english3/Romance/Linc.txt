I always say and I will die on this hill. “When in doubt give me an MC book”I really like this one. It is quick pace, the plot it’s cool and the couple is great. But let me tell you that the side “couple” because I know they will be the next book couple, were GIVING! I read this book loving it but with one eye on the next because I love Lucy SO SO much and Jude was also giving me all I wanted. But back to this one.Linc is part of MC club and he came from a childhood where he witnessed his mother being beaten by his father on the daily till she was finally able to scape him. So needless to say that women abuse is completely, totally, irrevocably, extremely a problem for him. He doesn’t accept and takes issue even if he doesn’t know the person. So here comes Charlie, she is a waitress in this almost dead diner in this sleepy old almost dead town. Linc and his best friend Jude stop by to grab something to eat and Linc immediately notice the signs of abuse on her but is convinced by Jude to let it go because he won’t be there to protect her from whatever it is since they are leaving next day. They go back to the Motel but Linc can’t sleep cause he is that upset about it. Starts to storm and he sees this small figure walking on the side of the road and he wants to help. And who is it? Yep Charlie, beaten to a pulp in a very bad shape. He stops ask her to take him back to the stupid boyfriend and HE beats him to almost death, as they are leaving because he was taken her to whatever place she wanted , the police shows up and he gets arrested. She fleas the town and Linc gets sentence to 10 years in prison!!!!!! He is released after 6 years, he doesn’t blame her but is a little upset she never defended him. And now by complete works of destiny the meet again and she’s been on the run all this time. She wasn’t safe living happy like he thought. And guys the story goes from there and it is GREAT.There’s found family, MC environment, violence, funny situations (always because of Lucy and Jude) and perfect delicious smut. I just didn’t give 5⭐️ because Charlie irritated me a little by not trusting Linc enough with her secrets. Bih what else does he need to do to prove he is loyal? Going to prison for 6 years, defending you in a shootout plus taking you and your friend to live with him for protection wasn’t enough? 🙄
