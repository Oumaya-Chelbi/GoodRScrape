3.25 StarsOh my, Mother of Traumatizing Calamity! Ironically, this is the ✨BLANDEST✨ CoHo’s ever been.First of all, CoHo should’ve made this into a THRILLER cause I think the premise would make for a better romantic suspense than whatever this ended up being. Alas, this book showed that the Queendidindeed MISS once in a while. 🤷‍♀️Second, it’s only the first month of 2022, and here’s CoHo wreaking havoc on my heart with another one of her tragedies. Again. 😢 And this time, she even managed to drag COLDPLAY into it. What a travesty! 😒Third,seriously though, this woman has an unhealthy fascination with ‘dramatic’ accidents and car wrecks. Her books should be the poster child for road traffic safety or automobile/home insurance company. 💀🚘Kenna Rowanis an ex-con who served her five year sentence in prison for involuntary manslaughter of her then still alive boyfriend. Upon discharging, she’s looking to start over and reconnect with the daughter she carried and birthed during her serving time but never had the chance to hold.The romance comes in when she meets ex-football player and current bar owner,Ledger Ward, whom she immediately feels mutual attraction to. Unfortunately, ✦bad timing✦ and any hope of pursuing anything more is quickly dashed when they find out who the other personreallyis.Ledger is Kenna’sdead boyfriend’s (Scotty)best friendwho’s been taking care of her daughter along with Scotty’s parents.It’s not CoHo if it isn’t full of painful truths. This book explores how unfair the world is towards ex-felons, especially female ones, and the challenges they face in navigating life after prison. It also highlights how powerless they are, especially those who also happen to bemothers. I didn’t outrightly cry, but this book did get me teary eyed.The Mother/Daughter ReunionI don’t think this part is handled particularly well. Not that it didn’t break my heart seeing Kenna’s longing for her child and her struggle as well as desperation to see her. However, I’m disappointed that Kenna didn’t try harder to fight for her daughter. Not that there was anything much she could do in her position. But she only tried once, got rejected by the people in her daughter’s life, and was ready to give up. I feel like she should’ve made more plans, taken more steps, be more persistent.I’m disappointed at Kenna’s acceptance and constant understanding of the animosity she received from the people in her daughter’s life. She believed she wasn’t a bad person and hoped for forgiveness and redemption, but she didn’t do much to reach for them.I don’t necessarily want this book to be all about Kenna’s efforts to reunite with her daughter to the point that it overshadowed the romance, but the fact that it sortawas, yet I still found it lacking was most ironically dismaying.The Romance“Maybe it doesn’t matter whether something is a coincidence or a sign. Maybe the best way to cope with the loss of the people we love is to find them in as many places and things as we possibly can.”Idk what to think of the romance. I think it was poorly written. Kenna and Ledger didn’t fall in love under the best of circumstances, but I’m afraid Ledger might just be a consolation prize for Kenna. I’m not sure if Kenna was over her grief and already moved on from her dead boyfriend. Also, the fact that she still wrote him letters, I don’t know what to make of that. I loved that we saw glimpses of their relationship from those letters. At the same time, it only emphasized how much she loved him.By the end of the book, I didn’t feel assured that Ledger was not just a replacement. Not to mention, the dilemma and the guilt they had to deal with because of who Ledger was to her dead boyfriend. Makes me think, what if they’d met when he was still alive?They fell in love because of that one common denominator, but I also wanted to see them fall for each other without that shared grief and pain.I suppose, it served him right cause for a romance H, Ledger sure tasted like unseasoned crackers. 🤪The Accident[SPOILERS!!!]For the majority of the book, I kept waiting for that one mindblowing twist that CoHo is known for, butthe fact that THERE’S NOT ONE SINGLE PLOT TWIST (besides Ledger the BFF) is utterly disappointing, disappointingly underwhelming, and very unbecoming of CoHo. It was hard to comprehend and accept that the accident happened because Kenny was being careless and irresponsible. Even when she described it in detail near the end of the book, the logic was somewhat lost on me.How can a person be disastrously stupid? 😫 Not that I’ve ever been in a car crash. I’ve been in a motorbike crash TWICE, but both were minor and I wasn’t the driver. It didn’t feel great, but it didn’t send me into a tailspin of panic the likes of Kenna’s either, so I guess I shouldn’t judge. In any case,somehow I expected the accident to be a misunderstanding.And perhaps, the plot twist would be her dead boyfriend being the driver/the one at fault; hence, Kenna was falsely accused, but she accepted her sentence cause she felt guilty. I mean, wouldn’t that be more epicly plausible???“Sometimes I wonder if we’re all born with equal amounts of good andevil. What if no one person is more or less malevolent than another, and thatwe all just release our bad at different times, in different ways?”Closing Thoughts . . .I suppose the point of all this is to show that no matter how tiny the mistake you make, it can have insurmountable consequences. But it shouldn’t be theonlything that defines you for the rest of your life as long as the path to forgiveness and redemption is open and you’re willing to take the journey (which Kenna kinda did, but it was unconvincing?). 🏃‍♀️Reminders of Himwas a tough read, but it didn’t hit as hard as CoHo’s other books. Usually, I’d be deeply affected by her stories no matter that I ended up loving or hating them. This one fell somewhat in the middle. 😪 I think it could’ve benefited from a longer page count.In my opinion, the plot was underdeveloped. The romance was uninspired. The lack of plot twist was THE plot twist itself. 🤯 The ending was rushed and wrapped up too neatly. The side characters were more interesting than the MCs. The pacing felt off.Overall, it was an emotional read that made my eyes water, but ultimately it read like a typical women’s fiction (that was evidently “CoHo,” but didn’t bear her special trademark). I don’t think this is amustread for CoHo fans, but if you have FOMO, then I suggest don’t come in with high expectations. Maybe then you’d appreciate the book more than I did. ✋(Read as an Audiobook)
