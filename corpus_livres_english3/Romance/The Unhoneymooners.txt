Total waste of time…* A couple with no chemistry or no connection whatsoever.* A hatred for two and a half years for no reason at all - or a stupid one that is not understandable.* A story that is not even funny at all other than a few good jokes but they cannot save this book.* A boring and lame relationship that never feels like romance. It doesn't make you feel.* A heroine who is quirky and a hero to hate! They make a couple like cartoon characters.*********************************************That’s the short summary of the book. Here’s a longer one:The hero (Ethan) likes the heroine (Olive) when they first meet and she also thinks he is a hot guy. Ethan actually wants to ask Olive out but his brother, who is going out with her twin sister, says “No". He says that she is a bitter person and she is his girlfriend’s twin sister and it would be weird and he listens to him.He listens to him!!!! and goes out with other women! Then he has a serious relationship with a woman, he proposes to her but she leaves him.I should have stopped reading when I saw what a lame guy he was by listening to his brother but for some dumb reason, I still tried hoping it would get better.*********************************************As I said, his brother is the douche-bag boyfriend/fiancé and later husband of Olive's twin sister, Ami, whom we later discover that is a cheater. Dane is a cheater and a liar and he is a manipulative bastard!When Ami and Dane are getting married, all the wedding guests, including the bride and the groom get poisoned by the buffet food, it’s only Ethan and Olive, who are left unaffected because they didn’t eat from the buffet. Everyone is so very sick and Ethan and Olive end up going to the honeymoon not to waste it.*********************************************Their hatred is based upon nothing at all. Ethan's brother said she was a pessimistic and bitter person so he hates Olive based on it. What a tool! And Olive thinks that Ethan thinks she is fat and unattractive so she hates him. What a fool!Whatever! In the hotel they stay, they join every stupid activity that bore me to death! And there, they see Olive's future boss and Ethan's ex-grilfriend with her new fiancé and they decide to pretend. This pretension slowly diminishes their hatred and feelings start to emerge but it is so badly written that I never felt their chemistry or I never actually believed in their feelings.*********************************************The romance is so very badly written all along the book. Only a few jokes are funny and I smiled a few times. But the romance was so bad… so very bad… And the whole story was utterly boring! A yawn fest, indeed!And when they finally get intimate, there are onlya few kisses and then fade to black scenes…Seeing how badly the writers write the kissing scenes, it might be good that they didn’t try to write a love-making scene but still I hate “fade to black” love-making scenes!*********************************************It was also frustrating that the writers wrote embarrassing scenes to make it funny, such as falling on the bathroom floor naked on top of each other before there was anything between them.Oh, and then, there was a naked massage he had to apply to her and she was both embarrassed and turned on - yeap, he HAD TO do it while she was naked just because the massage therapist who thought they were married offered it and they thought they should pretend... Pretend, my as*! This is utter stupidity that the writers are trying to make us believe!*********************************************OK, with such an “emotion-less” and “boring” story that gets to be funny very rarely, I was already going to rate it low (maybe 2 or 3 stars) but it soon earned its 1 star when the hero showed how lame he really was (I would give it a zero star if I could, by the way).Here is what happens that made me go crazy with anger!The twin-sister Ami’s husband Dane is the hero’s brother, as you might remember, and he cheats on his wife. He cheated on her many times all along these years while they were going out and now when they are married, he still cheats on her.When Ethan talks about his brother’s affairs to Olive, she is frustrated on her sister’s behalf but Ethan believes that his brother is perfect so he insists that Ami should know they had an open relationship and she was ashamed to tell it to Olive. (what a reasoning!) However, they are twins and Olive is so sure that her sister thought they were exclusive. Still, Ethan doesn't want her to talk about this to Ami and for the time being, she agrees.When they come back from the honeymoon, the married couple sees that their siblings are now together. First they are shocked but then, they seem to accept it. One day, the disgusting brother Dane hits on our heroine Olive (as if all the women he was cheating on his wife with weren't enough already). And the pig suggests that they can spice things up by changing partners. Such a low person! She already was angry with him and when he suggests this, she is furious!And when she talks to Ethan about what his brother did, our heroDOESN’T BELIEVEhis girlfriend!!!!He just cannot believe his brother would do that!!!!She insists that he DID propose it but he still doesn’t believe her and when they cannot agree, he breaks up with her…Yeap, hebreaks up with her!!!!She asks him what she could gain by lying about him but Ethan doesn't have the brains to understand that the woman who he has witnessed as the worst liar in the world cannot lie about such an important thing. During the honeymoon, he saw how bad she was at pretending and how she couldn't tell lies easily. And he doesn't even give her the benefit of the doubt. Only a woman who is a fool and misunderstands people easily or an evil woman with a hidden agenda would tell such a lie and Ethan puts the woman he supposedly loves in one of (if not both) categories.And the writers must have thought that wasn't bad enough, so when the time comes and she talks to her sister Ami, she also doesn’t believe that her husband cheats on her and that he also hit on her own sister.She accuses her sister of being evil!!!! I never liked Ami anyways and I was right about her.Our poor heroine is blamed by the two most important people in her life: the man she loves and her own twin sister.And weeks later, Ami discovers her husband's cheating ways and as you might guess, when Ethan sees it with his own eyes, he feels sorry for thinking his brother is the perfection. He apologizes to Olive a few times and she forgives him and I want to throw my kindle at the wall, yelling, “How could you forgive him, you fool!!!??” But of course, I don’t, as this lame book is not worthy enough to sacrifice my Kindle.But seriously, imagine this:Your boyfriend’s brother hits on you and suggests you should have sex for a change to spice things up. Obviously, you feel disgusted. You talk to your boyfriend about it and he doesn’t believe you. He doesn’t even offer to go talk to him to make sure there is a misunderstanding – he just believes his brother would never do that and says you must have misunderstood (because you are such a fool!) or making it up because you hate him.Then, because you cannot agree on this matter, he breaks up with you.Well, some time later, when he sees with his own eyes that his brother is a douche-bag and a cheater, he understands that you might be right about him, so he comes and says he is sorry and he wants you back.Would you forgive him?If you would, then feel free to try this book…I would never ever forgive such a lowlife! A man who does this once will do more and worse things later. Nope, this is something unforgivable in my book!NOTE TO SELF:Add these writers to your avoid shelf! After 2 huge disappointments and one mediocre read, it's time to stop trying their work.
