Audio review here:Well I finally Popped my Audiobook cherry here and it was ORGASMIC!For me, I found the audio version of this book was way hotter than the ebook version.I mean honestly, I was self fanning myself every few minutes and my kids thought I was batshit crazy as I stood before the air conditioner! (Don't worry I had on my earbuds)Wow! Just WWWWOOOOWWWW!Now that guy's voice will be playing in my head for days.The person playing Kat's voice was not as good. Frankly, I found her voice annoying at times.(The way she said panties just agh!) But since most of the book happened from Lyons POV, I was very good with that!The only problem is that I can never read-listen to this book for my original intended proposes (starting a new workout routine), as it was way too engaging!I would recommend this audiobook to anyone enjoying BDSM/Dom/sub type of book!______________________________________________________Well that was different. I can't say I loved this book. It was way too disturbing to make for a great read.I should point out to all that my thoughts are mine and they are not the general consensus here. Again I am part of the unpopular opinion.SPOILERS HERE READ AT YOUR OWN RISK!Firstly,I am trying to wrap my mind on how it's a good idea for a grown ass man of 32 to give a virgin girl (yes she is a girl at 18) two nipple and clit piercing her first time out of the gate!?Secondly,How could he be so cruel to her. He grabbed her by the hair and drags her to be punished for something she did not even do or had no clue she was doing. He did it for hours just to prove he was in control of his woman.Wow I really don't get how that is hot!Really he hurts her and gets off on it and wow that's romantic? I don't get the whole BDSM LIFE.Sounds like he can do whatever he likes and she has to do what he says ( but he did not even tell her anything here). I am not judging here but shit he is a man of 32 he should have told her what his problem was. She can't read minds and this is her first relationship and she goes in the deep end having no clue how to swim.Thirdly,He should have introduced her slowly to his lifestyle of choice. Even if she is into it, she does not understand the rules if you don't lay them out for her. Again, she is not a mind reader here.Ok so I give it a 3 stars because I can see they are both happy with their relationship and he is very alpha.However, to me she just comes off as stupid and spineless! All the time it's yes sir!It seems to me She has no thoughts of her own and no free will. She let's everyone decide for her. The only time she shows any spine is when she is beating the hell out of Colton's ex whores.He slept with these "bitches" and I do mean that literally because that's what he calls them. It just demonstrates how little respect he has for anyone, not even her dad and or her mom. That is not right in my estimation. Her parents are giving and caring people who deserve more than the treatment they receive by the hero.Now I am going to take a break from this series and read a sweet book.Warning: explicit violence murder and secondhand account of group rape, BDSM sex, anal sex, brutal sex, and Dom/sub relationship.
