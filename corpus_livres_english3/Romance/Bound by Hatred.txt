She isegomaniacEven if she showed little protectiveness towards Lilly and Aria but I reckon that was out of anger and impulse.Highlighting some of the major problems I have with her -❌Gianna 'sbipolar personality(sweetheart you will kiss him, seek physical closeness but yet your prejudice was so big that you will spite him, insult himwhat about his reputation!)❌Because of her foolishness, her younger sister had a panic attack❌Most of the time She is in complete denial❌I have never met a female protagonist thismean❌Aria and Luca's relationship took a bitter turn because Her elder sister obviously can't leave her unprotected while she ran away❌I mean you are suicidal it's okay but why would you drag down others with you 😒❌What was her point to roam around all over Europe let me know pls?❌Sweetheart, you do realize that you could easily be married off to a man who could be a Potential sadist and could be 20 years older than you right?Turns out All it took to make her come to her senses was to get called out by Luca 🤧🤧🤧 (thanks bae)**********Fangirling alert**********“I don’t give a fuck about your father’s men, and I don’t give a fuck about your father.

I was in awe of him because of that.🌟BossinessTho Luca was The intimidating guy, The Alpha, and obviously the Capo but still, Matteo gave Luca a tough fight and didn't bend🌟His witI grinned and kissed her ear. “Do you know how kids always get a treat as a reward after they see the doctor?”"Be a good girl and you shall be rewarded.”OMFG................🌟His attitude"Messed up is good.”I really love that he doesn't like it easy. He likes challenges and he is relentless and never gives up. That makes him unique. He is like a champion as he should be 💪.Also, I am super impressed with how he can keep cool with his wife.PlotTho I didn't like Gianna's ungratefulnessbut still, I really loved their banters and back and forth 😍 it was livelyHero chasing heroine, pinning for her,The Hunter and The Preymmm hmm love thatAlso can I just say Cora Reilly writes really Good SMUTs 🙈🙈🙈honestly, I am picky about SMUTbut I really like SMUTs in her books (insert dreamy eyes )okay..........enoughVitiello Brothers Duo"I don’t need a pity fuck.
