"You can love someone and still know the future you’d have with them wouldn’t work for you, or for them, or maybe even for both of you."Maybe things can always get better between people who want to do a good job loving each other. Maybe that’s all it takes.this book is my comfort book. everything about it is so beautiful, from the characters to the setting. if you were to ever ask me what my all time favorite book is, i would say this onewith no doubt. but if u knew me, you’d already know this. and i’m so glad that hasn’t changed in any way. i have tried writing this review so many times and every single time i’ve been at a loss for words. there’s simply no way to perfectly convey my love for both this book and alexpoppy. i am 100% convinced i sound super cheesy when i’m writing this so i’m warning u rn.I wrote the last one mostly for me. This one’s for you.emily henry really did write this book for me!! in the words of alex and poppy, this bookspeaks to me(iykyk). i’m sure everyone has one book that they resonate with so deeply, and this book is it for me. it’s always hard for me to express my love for a book. i feel like this book was made just for me, and while this book isn’t for everyone, it’s definitely for me. poppyalex are so flawed and those flaws helped create the person that they are. i wouldn’t change them in any way.“That crush of happiness, that feeling thatthisis what life’s about: being somewhere beautiful, with someone you love.”“I love you all the way, Alex,” I say. “I couldn’t have lived with myself if I hadn’t at least told you.”i think the past perfectly showcases how deep their friendship went and it was all the more realistic. i loved the way they bonded in the past, from slow dancing in the streets to having late talks into the night. these chapters talking about the summers they shared were so enjoyable bc it made me love them all the more. god i am so in love with this book. they got off on a rough start, but once they got to know each other and see how different they were, i loved how their friendship blossomed. the way they were willing to be open about the others’ interests and give it a try simply because they were intrigued literally means so much to me. they accepted each other and never once tried to change one another. the love they had for each other was just true unconditional love. (yes that is another reference)‘opposites attract’ is one of my favorite concepts, and this doesn’t just apply to books. the overall idea of being accepted as who you are and learning to love someone even more for their differences is so beautiful. they were two independent people who couldn’t bear to live their lives without one another. it was like they knew they’d be happy as long as they were together. without one another, their world shone a little less bright compared to how they were with each other. living their very best life without a care in the world bc the person they truly loved was there, and it’d be all okay.this is how friends to lovers should be done.the slow progress as they build this deep connection and bond through experiences and memories that they share. the tension between them was just another added factor that i loved. i think that’s why this book resonates so much with me. i don’t want to go into full detail but this book makes me feelunderstood.reading this book the second time around really opens your eyes. i was able to see the parallels within this book that were reflected in the end which i found to be so adorable. the nickname ‘tiny fighter’ was just so cute and the idea that they knew each other so well was just everything. they are the definition ofperfectly flawedcharacters and i have a soft spot in my heart for them. they really took the idea of home being a person and just ran with it. you can’t tell me they don’t exist because i will simply deny this fact. they exist in my mind which is good enough for me.“I loved being in the city, surrounded by art and food and noise and new people, enough that the school part of it was bearable”“Because no matter what makes all those people different, they’re all just trying to get somewhere, waiting to reach someone.”Because I will never again feel as alone as I did during those long nights as a kid. As long as I have him, I will never be alone again.“You’ve always beenPoppy.”slight spoiler warning.poppy. where do i start with her? she’s absolutely amazing. she’s like this ball of energy that had me laughing from the very beginning. she was the definition of lovely (in my completely humble opinion) and she was never afraid to express herself through her eccentric style which i found to be so cute. after going through and putting up with the bullying she suffered in her high school years, i’m so glad she never lost herself. her past was something that she never let define her and it’s clear that she loves her rowdy family despite wanting to “escape” it. however, she was running away from the feeling of being alone rather than the people that she loved. despite her efforts, she was never able to truly run away from it and had to accept that the past was a part of her life to move on. this was character development on both poppy and alex’s part. she had this running fear that she’d never fit in, and that fear was placed onto alex bc of their opposite personalities. i love the idea that he loved her even after seeing all of her. making her feel accepted and loved throughout the years she felt she wasn’t.he’s that person for her.the way she’s unapologetically herself and how alex loves her for it makes my heart warm. i can’t live with myself knowing poppyalex aren’t real.watching poppy fall in love with alex throughout their friendship was honestly so cute. it felt as though i was being taken along on this journey with poppy and i’ve never been so grateful. it’s like being merely a spectator in the world that poppy and alex have created just for themselves. i’ve never wanted to watch anything more in my life. no one and no moment exists other than the one they live in. they only need each other, simply because they see that they are perfect the way they are.i was worried the second time around that i wouldn’t end up liking one pov but it never became a problem. rather, the past made me have a new love for the present bc i understood just how far their bond went. i felt bad bc poppy had this pressure to make this trip seem like the others and how hard it must’ve been for her. the past showed how she felt with alex over all these years they spent but now that she has the chance to fix it, she has this fear that there’s a chance he will slip away again. the present served as a purpose to understand them even further with their thoughts and understandings. the past highlighted their bond, while the present talks about their feelings and the meaning within their little moments that they were still able to maintain despite not talking for 2 years. even if it was awkward, it would never last and they learned to talk it out. communication was the key in the present.“I’ve always felt like once someone sees me deep down, that’s it. There’s something ugly in there, or unlovable, and you’re the only person who’s ever made me feel like I’m okay.” His hand sweeps gently across my face, and I open my eyes, meet his head-on. “There’s nothing scarier than the chance that, once you really have all of me, that changes. But I want all of you, so I’m trying to be brave.”“I’ve never really felt alone since I met you. I don’t think I’ll ever feel truly alien in this world again as long as you’re in it.”listen to me you guys:alex nilsen.the man who carried poppy down a mountain when she was hurt, waited 12 years for her, held her hand bc she loved holding hands even if he hated it, LEFT HIS PLANE BC SHE WAS SICK, AND GOT A VASECTOMY WHEN SHE HAD A PREGNANCY SCARE UNRELATED TO HIM. the list goes on and on. the love he had for her is absolutely incredible. the little snippets of alex’s pov based on how he communicated with her made me want to give him a hug. he spent his life acting like the big brother, the one who had to hold it all together and make everything feel better because of the pressure of being there for everyone. no matter how much burden was put onto alex, he always worried about poppy and i love him so much for that. i love the idea that he was so reserved and only showed his personality in front of her, who brought out the best in him and made him let his guard down to just be himself. even if he looked out for her at times, it’s clear that he knew he could trust her and just have fun in her presence. she has this energy that is just so bright and contagious and perfect. the love he had for poppy was shown in everything he did for her and the way they cared for each other was just beautiful. the thought and ideas put into these characters made them feel so real on another level. they’re the it couple. i cannot begin to describe how perfect they are together.“Im sorry for being so tall”“I’m sorry for being so short”“I like you short,” he says. “Never apologize for being short.”“You are, you know.”“A fighter?” I say.“My home,” he says, and kisses me.We are, I think. We’re home.Maybe that’s why he can handle the public affection. Maybe, like me, when we’re together he feels like no one else is there, like they’re phantoms we dreamed up as set dressing.Even if we never kissed, never said the words outright, we were keeping whole parts of our hearts for each other onlyspoilers from this point onanother thing was the character development. poppy and alex wouldn’t have been the people that they are right now, without learning from their mistakes with their exes. throughout their friendship, they dated other people and it was never as though they waited around for one another. they play it off as this belief that it would never work out. however, finding out that the reason they hesitated to be together for so long stemmed from their own insecurities made me so sad. they couldn’t deny the love that they had for each other and being with other people helped them realize that they were meant to be. not with anyone else but each other.alex thought through everything and cared about poppy so much while they were friends. it was heartbreaking to realize that he never felt as though he was enough bc he felt she deserved the absolute world and he thought he couldn’t give her that. he was so organized and wanted to settle down with his life, in contrast to poppy, who lives her life in a carefree manner and enjoys it in every way she can try. i love that they seemed to be willing to date other people in the span of their friendship, because it allowed them to realize that they really were meant to be and they just had to take that extra step to truly be together happily.i always get the feeling that emily henry’s books are so much more than the blurb lets up on and in this case, it’s true. the croatia trip wasn’t just a trip, it was clarity for both alex and poppy. it solidified alex’s beliefs bc he felt as though poppy played down the fact that it happened and he had to live with that knowledge for so long. i never expected much to come out of that trip simply because there was already so much depth to the characters and to add even more would just be overwhelming. i feel content with the fact that poppy was able to look at the croatia trip from another perspective after everything that went down with alex. she got to understand him and everything that he did all for her.the third act conflict really hits deep in this book! i could physically feel my heart breaking in half for them. i felt like i understood everything within that moment and i’ve never felt so sad. this book isn’t just about the romance, it’s a journey ofself-realizationfor poppy as she figures out for herself how she felt for alex. i think that this built up the angst very well. it’s clear poppy means something to alex and once i understood the miscommunication, it was like i was being betrayed. i felt like i understood where alex stood so well, and i believe that i recognize poppy. everything from her point of view was so confusing because she never really knew how to express her love for him. it was years of pent up love for alex while it took poppy years to fall in love with alex just to realize it would never truly be able to work. to make up for this, she constantly tried dating people that she felt “fit” with her which is the complete opposite of the dynamic between poppy and alex.poppy was the one who held the belief that they would never be good together and never really understood why until the end of the book. it’s the beauty of this book, realizing you have to get over your fears to truly experience life, and love, the way it should be experienced:to the fullest, with the person who is absolutely worth it. in the end, all that mattered was how they felt about one another, and the fact that they held no judgement, only love for each other in the end. they truly deserved their happy ending after being in each others lives for so long and the pain they went through. it just blew my mind how amazing these characters are and how deeply i can relate to each of them. no one will fill they void like they do. i loved that both these characters grew from their past and learned to love each other the way they did. their character development was absolutely beautiful and i am so glad that they got their happily ever after. i am never getting over this book and the pain that comes with the experience. emily henry, i would like to truly thank you for this.pre-reviewthis book has changed my brain chemistry in the best way possible and i want to hold on to this feeling forever. rtc <3pre-read reviewidk a better way to prepare myself for happy place other than to reread one of my comfort books 🧘‍♀️
