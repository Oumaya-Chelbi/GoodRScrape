✨...I would…take the vasectomy over this✨To get it out in the open:No this is not a bitter rivals book at all, no she’s really not an ice queen and it’s literally not a secret, no he is most certainly not Roy Kent (even accidentally), and no the romance isn’t ultimately central to the story. I found this to be more of a sister relationship story with a romance subplot. The romance/relationship was basically reserved acquaintances to quick fondling friends. I thought I could love it but I just couldn’t keep making excuses or trying to convince myself that the next page would have the moment I’ve been reading for.If I was really trying to start something, I’d call this Frozen fan fiction.I mean seriously the word frigid is used enough, and the amount of ice/ice queen/frozen/ice in my body/I’m literally a block of ice with eyes language is astounding.I honestly don’t foresee many people having my same reaction to this book. I think it’s a fine, easy read but absolutely nothing special. Emily Henry’s name attached will make it special to a lot of readers and that’s fine. Sally Thorne is that kind of author for me. I thought it had potential, a lot of it, but it ultimately fell so flat. That disappointment made me the most upset. I gave it 2.5 stars for the “fine” easiness of it, but I didn’t round up because I think it could’ve been more than fine but it wasn’t and that’s the boob punch.Full review below. Sorry if I’ve wrecked your dreams of this one. Personally, I didn’t like it but I’ve been told I’m petty. This is the part I should say “but I hope you love the book!” But my previously established petty ass will forever and always choose to write about how misery loves company and that I’m saving you a seat.✨Overview:I was hopeful. I read the first 67% of this book super fast. I was t h r i l l e d that I was enjoying my time. I love to love books. I want to love books. It’s so much easier to love books. But I think looking back on that first two-thirds of the book, I was ignoring small and irritating things because I r e a l l y wanted to love this book. The relationship was cute, if surface level, and while the book was absolutely not rivals to lovers, I still liked the set up.But I was waiting for that spark to happen. That b i g revelation in the relationship when tensions are high and trust is fragile. The “I have a l w a y s loved you” painted bedroom or even the errant vasectomy (iykyk) big reveal. Something shocking or surprising or different.My kingdom for s o m e t h i n g.Anything. I really thought we’d get one. Instead I got a whole lotta Libby (main heroine’s sister), a weirdly placed Hallmark “Big City Person turned Small Town Person and Local Store Savior” moment, and book metaphors. So many book metaphors. (Thinking about it now, the “something” twist was here I guess…but it’s not regarding the romantic relationship so no dice and it wasn’t even interesting. It made a could be interesting plot point uninteresting.)✨Steam:I knew the last third of the book would feature their inevitable sex scene, but before we got to the Big Penetration Sensation, the moment that would wrap this book up with a bow, I was finally trapped by too many irritating things. They piled up to a height I couldn’t ignore; a height that cast a m o s t a g g r i e v e d shadow over the nice and tidy nothing special five-orgasms-in-one-sex-scene sex scene.Since I was already annoyed by the time we got to The Sex, the language was just way too flowery and metaphorical for me. I don’t care what the idea of Charlie feels like. Or just how much he resembles a book. I just want to know how he feels in your v a g i n a.The phrase “we fall into each other” made me want to gag. Just say you fucked goddamnit y’all are falling into each other all over the place! Ya topsyturvy mofos.I will say the sex was definitely more than I thought we’d get. There were three almost sex scenes prior to the Rolie Polie Olie fan fiction. The language went to the extent of “nipples” and “erection” but they did their jobs. The three prior scenes were each hot because the locales were super hot: front door, midnight pond, library. I think this is Emily’s hottest book. I would be fine with this sex/steam level in another book… with the one caveat that I actually like the rest of the book.✨Characters:Libby pushed me too far with her not being able to understand that Nora had a job and couldn’t just take three weeks off from work. Nora only worked until 5PM and took O N E phone call and Libby just had to puppy dog eye it. Nora was so self-sacrificial when it came to Libby. Yes I was annoyed at Libby, but goddamn girl take a hint and stop trying to help! She kept *covertly* throwing money at her sister it was weird. She gave up a lot of things and was about to do it again! She got some huge news and was like “but I’m so selfish for even wanting this during Libby’s midlife Hallmark crisis.” And when Nora finally got to lay into Libby, we were interrupted in such an eye roll way. Literally for fuck’s sake. It was my Rocky montage cut short by an untied shoelace and a face-plant into a bunch of stairs.I thought Charlie was pretty okay until he took a stab on the now communal blade of self-sacrifice. Out of nowhere, and only for the sake of previously non-existent tension, ol Chuck just had to fuck up his entire life for zero reasons. Nobody asked you for this rite of stoically unhappy passage sir. It was too much.This book was supposed to be a bloodthirsty shark and her grunting, broody nemesis. We got a minnow and a dude in a hoodie.She wasn’t really frigid, icy, or unfeeling at all. He wasn’t Roy Kent. He wore black once and I grunted more than he did. They had one semi-bad lunch two years ago that apparently made them rivals (it didn’t).I get that “underneath it all” she wasn’t supposed to be frigid or icy, but literally her exterior was just as nice and normal as her lukewarm inner self.✨Plot:He was an editor; she was an agent. He rejected a book (about an old man’s dog dying, fun!) she pitched. Two years pass and now that profound dog death book is a best seller. Her sister is having a Moment and wants to travel to the real town of this—thankfully—fictional dog death book. A book described as if that Sarah Machlaclan commercial just ended with a basket of dead puppies. The agent finds the editor is also in the obscure small town, a big *shock.*She shows him the die-puppy-die author’s most recent manuscript and it’s so good! brilliant! fucking amazing! perfect! for no reason at all because it’s frankly quite bad!(You really don’t get any actual details to turn the idea of that manuscript into a plot that makes sense so… gotta trust their Midas touches there I guess.)Since the author is *fragile,* frigid shark lady (?) must make sure the mean stormcloud dude (?) isn’t too mean. Yes the shark is actually being nice because she’s literally a nice person who rides a Peloton because she likes it. She was nothing at all like Margaret Tate—I love Margaret Tate. There’s nothing beneath the surface of either of the main characters, at least nothing intriguing. You get the basic plot points that check off the basic plot point list (including a great love for lists!). Her peloton is shoved so far down your throat you’re basically training for the Tour de France. The author seemed to think that owning a Peloton is the hallmark of a bitchy person so if she just! keeps! mentioning! pelofuckington! we’ll have to start to believe Nora is an unfeeling ice cube with thighs of steel.Of course, it’s really supposed to show us that nice people can be blonde and ride Pelotons too, but it was just… poorly done.I thought the concept was fun at the beginning: Nora is the Big City girlfriend that the Big City boyfriend in a Hallmark movie dumps for the Small Town baker/Christmas tree farm heiress/struggling bed and breakfast owner because the Big City girlfriend is too blonde and too toned from the stationary bike she wants to fuck more than him. Cool but just so… not about that at all? How can that character be so boring??? Nora never proved to me that she had ever been a poisonous bitch worthy of Bob Spaulding’s scorn. Although she did declare herself “Heathcliff”…but I also think she likes Heathcliff…so back to square one.✨Conclusion:By trying to subvert so many tropes, this book just reverted back to every other trope.Congratulations ya played yourself. I think parts were definitely meant to be tropey, butI don’t think the book really meant to be so wholly predictable and unsurprising.There was nothing about this book that would make me pick it up again or anything that makes it stand out from the crowd. The relationship was so…blah by the end. Maybe I’m the frigid wench because I felt nothing akin to warm and fuzzy.Again, I liked this book for a lot of the book, but that was basically allhinged on the assumption that the relationship would go somewhere interesting and I’d be naming him the honorary mayor of my vagina.Once it was clear I wasn’t going to let Charles anywhere near a large pair of ceremonial scissors, the shiny, bright ribbon fell away and I was pissed. All the small annoying things just snowballed into Heat Miser territory and I literally broke into a musical number. So sorry family.That emotional and romantic payoff ending (and the big “I love you” “prove it” scene) was sacrificed for pages and pages of Libby and her bookstore charity case.The relationship got like the last two pages. Of course, more than a few pages were devoted to their “gut-wrenching” but oh so “righteous” split up. I initially said this was Emily Henry’s most romancey romance but I take it back. It ended up being way more about Nora and Libby than about Nora and Charlie. It is evident in the scope of the ending.Just go watch The Proposal instead.⭐️⭐️.5/5 🌶🌶.75/5Spoilerish idfk: P.S. Really, when a character hasn’t cried for over a decade, there are certain expectations in a romance. Just saying. You don’t wait the whole book to cry and then cry over something other than the penis attached to the love of your life. You don’t make it your entire character trait and then wait until cry number four to cry over him. Ya just don’t.*Thank you to the publisher for an advanced review copy! I really thought we had one bois I really did.
