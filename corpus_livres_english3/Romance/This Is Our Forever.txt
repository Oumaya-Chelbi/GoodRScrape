I wouldn't call this much of a story as it's more of an "insta" everything & not much depth, story or plot.SPOILER! STOP NOW IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE ENTIRE PLOT!So MCs were in love 3 years prior and MMC was all set to propose to FMC but never got the chance because she had just found out she was pregnant and came to his place to tell him but instead got the surprise of her life when she found a naked woman in his bed who made it seem that MMC was cheating on her when he was not.The OW in his bed was actually his BFF's. He used MMCs apartment and apparently his bed to hook up with women. So he was the one in the shower when FMC showed up and thought he was cheating on her.So devastated, she leaves and goes to her home where she gets a text from supposedly MMC's phone that states he never wants to see her again and that it's over. (This plot with the phone was never resolved BTW because even though we know it must have been the BFF who hated the MCs who did this, it was never brought up how he was able to get a hold of MMC's phone. Nor the angst with FMC & her Father was ever resolved either since he was ashamed of her single motherhood status).Anyhoo, FMC disappears and in the present she is an Event Planner and has a 2 year old son. MMC conveniently shows up at this event she is managing which he apparently & unbeknownst to him, had hired her.So they see one another and before they can even say a word, they are having sex. Then the coward FMC smacks him & leaves, he follows, they talk, he finds out he has a son and is all in, the BFF gets some comeuppance, all is forgiven and HEA. That is it. The entire story.Safety:It was mentioned that FMC was celibate during separation but nothing about the MMC. Only thing that was stated is that his BFF tried to get him to party with him but he never had the inclination as his work was a priority.No OW/OM drama other than the BFF getting fired and out of their lives.HEA a few years later with marriage and 2 more kids.
