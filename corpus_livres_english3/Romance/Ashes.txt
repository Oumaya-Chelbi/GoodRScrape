★★★★4.5 Ashes Stars ! ★★★★Oh Shit! Can't believe I finished the whole read in a short span of 3-4 hours ! But then again,Yes I can since I usually read all SW's books with the same vigor...My God..This book was unbelievable.I mean wow I expected this one to be a great read..But I didn't expect it to be such an anxiety inducing one ! Ugh! I can still feel my heart racing like a racehorse trying to pop out of my chest !Not gonna lie.I love this author and I LOVE Knox & Harper (in fact their actually my favorite SWright couple so far closely followed by Sam & Jared from herDeep in your veins series.So to say that I was excited for this book would be a understatement.But bloody hell ! This book really surpassed all my expectations with all its unexpected plot twist that came at me,one after the other.I've got to say though..I truly did not see the author choosing too turn the seriesthisspecific way..(Bare with me,I'm trying really hard to explain things without giving away the plot.) And to say that I was surprised would defiantly be an understatement...In fact I still don't know how I feel about...umm...thatthing.Yeah.In fact after the book hit about 50% the plot started to remind me a LOT of another book in a series that I know..But to mention that know would be me giving away the spoiler...So I won't do that.I actually thought about sliding a gif that kind of hints at the spoiler very smoothly here but then decided to go against that idea cause I'm pretty sure you guys would just figure it out.The only reason I did not give this a full five star was because I wished that the author had penned down the ending a bit differently....I meandoes Harperhaveto be kidnapped every single time in ever single book just to create the climax ?! I mean why can't the danger just come to them instead of Knox going to random place in every book to save Harper ?But nevertheless overall, I was in no way left feeling unsatisfied.Especially after the last chapter/epilogue...In fact I can't wait to see what next in store for them ;)Thanks for such an amazing ride SW ! You should know by now...Your one amazing author <3
