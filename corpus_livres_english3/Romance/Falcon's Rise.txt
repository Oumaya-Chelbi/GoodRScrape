In past books we saw glimpses of what was to come in this one. So getting to read all of it was fun and not. Fun because yeah, but not fun due to what Collins was going through. I hate that anyone has to go through something like that, let alone a little kid.I loved how Conleigh stepped up and wanted Collins the second she heard about her, no second thoughts at all and did it when she was 17. The mother/daughter duo was so cute together, very down to earth and all about praising each other. Even the cancer didn't cause that many waves with them, they did what they needed to to figure out the best way to fight.Gage was cute with both Conleigh and Collins. He quickly stepped in to help and more. I loved how he introduced them to the MC and how now there was all the more support. Even better was when there was a need every single member stepped up to see if they could help, so glad that one of them was able to.I hated the drama with Hazel towards the end, so happy with how that turned out on a couple of levels. Nice to see the family just living their lives happy.
