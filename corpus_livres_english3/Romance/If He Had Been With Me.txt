I see the dancing light and green leaves. Finny and I hide under bushes or in trees. Autumn is our birthdays and walking to school together and a deepening of that golden light. He and his mother spend Christmas at our house. My father makes an appearance. His father sends a present that is both expensive and unfathomable. A chemistry set. Custom-made golf clubs. Finny shrugs and lays them aside. Winter is a blur of white and cold hands shoved in pockets. Finny rescues me when other kids throw snowballs at me. We sled or stay indoors. Spring is a painting in pale green, and I sit watching from the stands while Finny plays soccer.Believe it or not, I think I must be the only person who didn’t see the ending coming even after the first chapter. Maybe I was delusional, maybe I was hopeful, but the truth is I just didn’t get it. I read the paragraph about him being untouched amidst shards of glass and the whole world going still, and I thought that Autumn was dreaming, or that she was mentally ill and the reality was vastly different. But I was wrong.I’ve loved him my whole life, and somewhere along the way, that love didn’t change but grew. It grew to fill the parts of me that I did not have when I was a child. It grew with every new longing in my body and desire in my heart until there was not a piece of me that did not love him. And when I look at him, there is no other feeling in me.After TFIOS, I’ve come to despise the trope where one of the main characters dies at the end of the book. Even if the character’s death makes the story heartbreakingly beautiful, I firmly believe that many authors do this partly for shock value and probably partly for memorability.🩵 PROS:✿₊⊹ Reading this book was like reading a teenage girl’s diary, and once I accepted that, it was easy to breeze through; I never once felt like picking up another book while reading this.✿₊⊹ Autumn was pretty alright. She didn’t annoy me too much, unlike most teenage main characters who are usually too self-entitled, edgy, shallow etc… You get the point. Yes she was quirky (what's with the tiaras lol?) and maybe a bit too try-hard. But overall Autumn was a pliable, down-to-earth and unassuming person.✿₊⊹ Depression was a topic which was very sensitively and well written in this book. Autumn's mother has depression, and it's highly implied that Autumn has it too as a result of genetics. In some chapters, I really liked the way Laura Nowlin portrayed Autumn's melancholy.I lay on my bed in late afternoon, watching a patch of light move across the floor, my throat tight, my body still. This is the saddest part of any day, when too much time has passed to create happiness while it is still light out. It’s too late. The daylight has been squandered on my immobility. The patch of light falls still; it begins to fade. It will be better when it is gone. This is only one day, I remind myself, and it is very nearly over.✿₊⊹ Autumn's teenage angst was surprisingly relatable, because she reminded me of myself in high school. Her relationship with Jamie reminded me of mine with my first boyfriend.Sometimes I am disappointed with love. I thought that when you were in love, it would always be right there, staring you in the face, reminding you every moment that you love this person. It seems that it isn’t always like that. Sometimes I know that I love Jamie, but I don’t feel it, and I wonder what it would be like to be with someone else.I love him the most when we fight and I am scared that he will leave me. After we fight, I want so much to be close to him, and the next day I want his hand in mine every minute. Sometimes he loves me more than I love him, and he wants me to pay attention to him, but I wish he would leave me alone so that I could go back to reading or talking to Angie about Mrs. Adams. Sometimes we both love each other a lot and it’s hard to hang up at night, and I wish it could always be like that.✿₊⊹ I especially loved that Autumn was a voracious reader. We love to see girls who read featured in books 🥰I can feel the printed words seeping through my skin and into my veins, rushing to my heart and marking it forever. I want to savor this wonder, this happening of loving a book and reading it for the first time, because the first time is always the best, and I will never read this book for the first time ever again.🩵 CONS:✿₊⊹ If I’d known she was going to refer to him as “Finny” the entire time, I NEVER would’ve gone near this book. Please all I want is to erase this name from my mind and never see it again.✿₊⊹ I didn’t see Finn’s (I absolutely refuse to call him Finny) appeal at all. Everyone raves about how well he treats Autumn and how much he cares for her, but the book is honestly just a chronicling of Autumn’s high school life with her group of misfit friends. Finn barely features in it for the majority of the book, except for some awkward moments. Also every time she called him Finny, I just kept imagining he was 10 years old and it probably diminished his attractiveness significantly.✿₊⊹ The fact that Finn cheated on Sylvie (since they were still together when he slept with Autumn) was so sleazy. I’m sorry I don’t care if him and Autumn are soulmates or whatever because it's so hypocritical. It completely ruined the romance for me. How can Autumn get so upset that her boyfriend Jamie cheated on her with her best friend, and then turn around and do the exact same thing to Sylvie? And how can Finn be so angry that Jamie treated Autumn that way, and then turn around and do the exact same thing to his girlfriend? It makes the both of them two-faced and despicable if you ask me.✿₊⊹ I've seen people saying this book is juvenile, and it's true. I couldn't connect to the characters as much since it's been years since I left high school, let alone middle school.In the end, reading this book was like reminiscing about a chronicle of my high school life, with its inherent friendships, relationships, heartbreaks, losses and joys.And I love him. For all of my memory, I have loved him; I do not even notice it anymore. I feel what I have always felt when I look at him, and I have never before asked myself what it is exactly. I love him in a way I cannot define, as if my love were an organ within my body that I could not live without yet could not pick out of an anatomy book.And finally, I have to acknowledge the truth of this line, which is simple yet evocative. Just like Autumn and Jamie, I was never truly in love with my first boyfriend, and he was not my first love. In fact, I met my first love later — but spoiler alert: we didn't last. After that relationship ended, I went on to fall in love again with other people. Yet there has always been a small part of me that wishes we were together again."Because everyone always says that you never get over your first love. She loved Mr. Rochester first, and she loved him so much. Even if she fell in love again, I think part of her would always be wishing she was still with him.”1.5 stars‎‎♡‧₊˚ PRE-REVIEW:It seems all I have been doing is reading disappointing books lately...‎‎♡‧₊˚ PRE-READ:I'm ready to cry 🥹🥹🥹
