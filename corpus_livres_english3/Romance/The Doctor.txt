4.5 stars Finally- I read a book with true doctor kink in itI’ve been craving a Doctor kink book for months now. I’ve read a few books with a doctor H, but this one really brought in the Doctor kink, and more than once- chef’s kiss in the kinky doc department 👏🏻.Cassidy is 19, almost 20, and has been in a relationship with her boyfriend for a few years now, but things have gone stale. They rarely see each other and don’t have a meaningful connection like they used to have. For a while now, Cassidy has been seeing her boyfriend’s dad in a different light, in a more carnal light. Dr. Greg Lowe is 40 and a very busy man; as a trauma surgeon, he’s on call a lot and doesn’t have time to be in a relationship or even to see women casually. Either way, he’s been interested in Cassidy for a while, but she’s his son’s girlfriend, so she’s obviously off limits, until she’s not 😈.Cassidy breaks up with Preston, but when she does it, he doesn’t take her seriously. He leaves to go to work in the middle of this conversation, again, not prioritizing their relationship or what she has to say. But guess who’s home when Preston leaves- yup, his father 😉. When Cassidy tells Greg that she and Preston broke up, they can’t help but indulge in the chemistry that’s constantly sizzling around them. The kiss they share is enough to solidify their connection, so when she comes back a week and a half later and gets brushed off by Preston yet again (she went to once again confirm that she was serious and they’re not together), all bets are off- let the sexy time begin 🔥🥵.The secretive rendezvous was delicious🤤… although they hesitate (for obvious reasons) they can’t help gravitating towards their baser, primal instincts of being intimate and having lots of smex😅. True, Cassidy isn’t a v, but Preston was a selfish enough lover that she never knew what true passion was like, until Greg showed her exactly what she’s been missing 🥵🔥😅. It’s primal, raw, passionate, and even emotional when they have sex. He becomes such a delicious alpha and she melts every time. And the kink I was missing in the other Doctor books comes out 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻. Not only in his office 🥵 but at home too 😉😅💦🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤. I very much enjoyed all the fantasies they recreated🔥🔥🔥.Although they’re basically 20 years apart, I still found their HEA believable ❤️. Plus, he was always about her, even towards the end when things got tough and decisions had to be made.I wish it was longer and it had more relationship/sweet moments, but hey, I knew what I was getting into when I read this 🤣.Overall, I loved it⚠️safety squad⚠️-no cheating*/sharing/owd*-mild omd- well, the h was with the H’s son in the beginning 😬. They kiss, but this is all before the H and h are together. OM2 hits on the h, but she shuts him down quickly and the H rescues her from the situation-OW has been sending baked goods to the H in order to get him to notice her- he doesn’t and isn’t remotely interested- and then she catches the H and h in a compromising position (she’s his neighbor and she was being a creeper by trespassing and watching them through a window) but the H puts her in her place ��he’s all about the h-the H and h’s mom see each other at the store and the h’s mom overhears the H asking for restaurant recs in order to take his gf out- the mom tells the h about this “girlfriend” of his and h thinks the worst, but the H was talking about her the whole time 🙈-condoms/it’s been a while for the H-HEA/epilogue/4 months
