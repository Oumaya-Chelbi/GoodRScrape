Ellis has a girlfriend and only sees and uses Maggie privately, making her the side chick.Maggie is a sweet lady who is OBSESSED with her boss (IDK WHY), and he can treat her like crap; & she is okay with it until Ellis announces that he is engaged, and Maggie loses her 💩 and quits. Ellis isn't happy about that because he still wants Maggie.Ellis is unhinged when he realizes he is about to lose Maggie for good he does some crazy 💩. Like offering to knock her up and put her and the baby in an apartment and have them set for life. He even contacts the pharmacy and puts a note on her account to ensure they don't refill her BC. When she runs away from her house because he keeps calling and showing up, he stalks her and tries to get her to come back to him.LOL, this guy was crazy as 💩𝑰𝒕 𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒏𝒔 𝒐𝒖𝒕 𝑴𝒂𝒈𝒈𝒊𝒆 𝑪𝒐𝒍𝒍𝒊𝒏𝒔, 𝒕𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝑰 𝒅𝒐 𝒏𝒆𝒆𝒅 𝒚𝒐𝒖.I love novellas.
