Sooo… this is one of those reads that’s nostalgic for me.Back in 2014, I FLOVED it. I was obsessed. I cried when the book ended because of the damn Cliffy. Then I read books 2 and 3 when the pandemic hit. And y’all know, we don’t judge ourselves during the pandemic 😅🫣.This used to be a book that I reread many times. Then I reread it in 2021 when I started adding safety info. And, well, I was shocked 😭. I forgot some stuff 🫣😅So…2020 Sonia and before 5 starred the ISH outta this book.2023 Sonia? Umm… maybe like 3 stars lol again… the nostalgia is making me biased 🫣 (the ow scene is making me downgrade it).Spoilers ahead:Prologue is 20 years in the past. Alexa and Antonio Falco are next-door neighbors and she can tell he’s getting abused. He’s bleeding and this little Alexa uses a band-aid to try to help his cut 🥹 (which actually needs stitches). This interaction left a huge impression on little Antonio- but not necessarily for a good reason. She made him think people could be good- that they’re not all bad. And he faces reality when Alexa ends up moving away and he continues to be abused ☹️.Decades later, Alexa’s in Australia working with troubled teens. On the way to her car one night, she gets assaulted, but then she gets saved by a man… a man she’s seen before, a man wearing a hoodie… a dangerous man 👀, one that’s been stalking and spying on her for a while. There’s this connection she feels for him; she can’t explain it, but it’s there.She asks him to stay with her that night, and then she needs him to sleep; he’s “willing” to stay with her, but she needs to keep something in mind: he f’s dirty 😅.Little does she know that the little boy from her childhood is the man that’s been stalking her for a while now 😬😅.What I liked:—the nostalgic feeling I get when I read this—how obsessed Twitch is with Lexi. He knows everything about her… and he can’t stop stalking her. This man finds ways of forcing himself into her life. He starts becoming involved with the organization she works for (he also has a vested interest since he was an abused child/teen).—the 🔥. Oh LAWD. It’s 🥵… a few of the 🔥 scenes from this book have lived rent-free in my head for YEARS 💦. There's the very first sex scene, the office scene (she has to talk to him while he satiates his hunger 😉), the CNC scene... I could go on... I'm not gonna lie; I don't mind rereading these scenes specifically lol—CNC 🥵. This is the first book I ever read that had CNC in it, and you know what they say, you never forget your first 😅🤷🏻‍♀️😉—the lengths he goes to for her... this man will do anything to protect her; he will sacrifice himself for her (and... well, he does)—how OTT jp he is. He's so possessive... any man that wants or touches her are gonna feel his wrath—touch her and die 😅😬🫣 (related to the previous bullet)—the side characters: I FLOVE Happy, Nikki, Dave… also Michael 🥹 and Tahlia❤️. Her best friends (Dave and Nikki) are sooo damn amazing... and Happy too! Gah!—the LGBTQ+ aspect. It’s subtly done, but it’s here. I loved that people don’t need labels to love other people 🤷🏻‍♀️❤️. A person is a person regardless of what gender they identify with 🥰. Plus, I wouldn't mind being in the same room as these people 👀—the OMD. Look. There’s owd throughout the whole damn book, I’m gonna take all the OMD I can get 💅. I usually like a better balance (OMD versus OWD), so in order for me to stomach the OWD, I needed the OMD—the few soft moments we get. Knowing how much of a shitty life Twitch has had, any time he showed his soft side, I took it...—the angst... (not all of it). Man, I criiiiiied so many times! Ugh...—the Cliffy was terrible. TEEEERRIBLE! But it made me cry. A LOOOOOOOT! I can’t believe BA wasn’t planning to write their HEA 😭 (if anyone read this when it first came out, she had a note at the end of the book saying she wasn't going to write a sequel to their story- which is why I was such a mess after 😭) I’m so glad she did.What I didn’t like—the OWD!!!! 🤬 Ling… 😤 I hated HATED her!! The scene where she “sits” on Twitch’s fingers (yeah, you know why 🤬) and he doesn’t really do anything to push her off PISSED ME OFF!!! The things I overlooked in 2020-Sonia-and-before 🤬. I consider this cheating in my book 🤷🏻‍♀️. She’s using his fingers to get herself off… and he doesn’t stop her… equals….Cheating 😐Lexi and Twitch were basically a couple; sure, not completely official (with a man like Twitch, it's not like he's going to ask her to be his girlfriend), but they were both obsessed with each other. Twitch couldn’t get tiny little Ling off of him? PU LEASE 🙄 GTFOH with that ish 🙄. I DGAF that she was his previous F buddy and they had a history... SHE'S. NOT. A. GOOD. PERSON!!!!—I wanted some soft moments with Twitch and Lexi. I know- it’s a dark read, but considering how obsessed he is with her, I was surprised we didn’t see more of this 😏—how quickly Lexi caves into Twitch. There’s push/pull, but I would’ve liked her to make him suffer some... ESPECIALLY after the Ling stuff 😐—considering how obsessed Twitch has been, why was he such a damn manwhore, especially when he orchestrated the attempted SA 😐? I get it. He’s reluctant to have anything pure or good in his life…Sigh 😑. The only saving grace for this is that Lexi wasn't pining for him (or a virgin).Overall, I still enjoyed it but I was definitely very VERY annoyed by the ow stuff⚠️ safety squad ⚠️-no sharing-toooons of OWD!!! The H works with his previous f buddy who causes lots of drama. She’s a b to the h and feels extra salty because the H isn’t willing to f her anymore-cheating? Eh depends on your definition. I think it is 🤷🏻‍♀️. The MCs were already intimate and obsessed with each other (but some can argue they weren’t “official” yet 😐) when the following scene happened:-OW goes to H’s office. She touches/feels H and he doesn’t react- She grabs his fingers and uses them to masturbate when she straddles him 🤬. He tells her to hurry up and doesn’t move his fingers to help her get off and she stops when she realizes his fingers are just there 🤬😤-OMD: when h is under the influence, she’s dancing sexually and grabs a OM and puts his hand and puts it on her p. Then she grinds her ass all over him. The H comes in and kicks his ass😅. Later she goes to a bar after H says the h is just “one of his girls” and flirts with OM2. She says she’ll F OM2 and then the H pulls a gun and threatens to kill him 😬-violence/bloodshed/torture/deaths-death of a side character-child abuse is recalled-attempted SA- the h is being assaulted when the H comes in and saves her-drug use-perceived death of a main character-CLIFFY!
