——— ☆re-read #2: welcome to clown-ville: population - 1 (phuong) ☆ ———UPDATE – 29/03/22Not one second after I hit publish on this review, I went back to the beginning to re-read Tristan’s first meeting with the boys and guess what? 5 hours later I’ve re-read this whole book again and updated this review by maybe one third, before I got distracted again and now I have no motivation to finish the rest lmao i'm sorry why am I such a mess. Third time’s a charm. 🤡——— ☆read #1☆ ———28/03/22I've readThe Takeoverin March 2021 and now we have March ... 2022, meaning I've been sitting on this half-written construction of a review for one year. 'I'm going to write the review tomorrow' turned into 'I'm going to finish this review someday' ahem. Normally I'd just rate the book and let the review rest in the pit of hell (34 draft reviews are looking very judgmental at me right now), but for once I actually love the formatting for this review. Also Tristan's meet cute with the kids is too good to not share.☆ BOOK REVIEW ☆TROPES: single parent, crazy kids, older woman-younger man, enemies-to-fuck buddies-to-friends-to-lovers, billionaire romanceSONG:Unsteady – X AmbassadorsI'm so happy I didn't give up on this author after reading The Stopover, which I found very meh, and seeing not so great reviews for some of T.L. Swan's other books, because ILOVEDThe Takeover.☆ ——— Short Plot Summary:Claire Anderson(h) andTristan Miles(H) had a rocky start. Both of them work in the media business under their media family company. When they meet for the first time, Tristan offers to buy Anderson Media off Claire, because their company is struggling and Tristan is known for his takeovers (duh). Claire doesn't react to the offer too kindly, since Anderson Media is her and Wade’s (her dead-husband) baby and she doesn't want to give up Wade's legacy. Six months later they meet again at a seminar, where Tristan holds a lecture and they start a fling, knowing that it can't be more since Claire has 3 children and Tristan, the manwhore that he is, doesn't want to settle down especially not with a whole bunch of kids.───── ⋆⋅☆⋅⋆ ─────I ADORE....───── ⋆⋅☆⋅⋆ ─────➵TRISTAN MILESHe is so hot... even if he came the first time after 5 pumps, but hey Claire just has a magic pussy who can blame him. Nothing screams 💫 love of your life 💫 more than when the Hero comes after 10 seconds, because he can’t control himself. The best part is when he’s gaslighting her that he couldn’t help himself, cause it’s actually her fault by being too irresistable. My favorite kind of gaslighting King <3no, but for real Tristan was just .. perfect. He was possessive, HOT, charming, witty, attentive, HOT, petty, smart. He’s the whole package deal. Sir, step on me. Please and thank you.(to be updated upon re-read #3)➵FIRST MEETING W/ THE BOYSWhen Tristan meets Claire's boys for the first time I CHOKED. That scene is hands down one of the funniest things I've read in a very long time. I was lying on the floor for a good 10 minutes, because I was crying so hard.What happens if your oldest son finds men underwear in your suitcase after your work trip and said man comes to visit you at your house? Well let me summarize the events for you:(1.) Fletcher threatens to kill Tristan with his bare hands(2.) Tristan takes a step back, steps on a skateboard and tumbles down the stairs(3.) Fletcher runs towards Tristan and starts whipping him with Tristan's own underwear(4.) When Fletcher asks Tristan if that's his underwear and Tristan doesn't answer, Fletcher gets so angry that he tries to suffocate Tris by sticking the underpants in his mouth(5.) Then Tristan and Claire get inside the house for his swollen ankle, Harry (the second oldest) comes and makes crazy eyes at Tris, begins to choke himself and falls to the floor and pretends to be dead.(6.) As if that’s not enough, Harry goes and gets a teddy bear and some kind of rope to tie it around the teddy bear’s neck and hangs it.I'm honestlyNOTblaming Tristan one bit that he wanted to get out of that unhinged household as fast possible and started to believe Claire when she told him that they're at two different points of their life and that he wasn't ready for kids. My man just wanted to get the fuck out. LMAOO TRISTAN WAS SHAKEN TO HIS CORE.😭🤚now here comes the best part: Tristan goes to work the next day and look who is coming for an interview for an internship at his company? FLETCHER FUCKING ANDERSON, Claire’s son who tried to choke him with his underwear lol. When Fletcher applied for the internship at Miles Media he didn’t actually know he would work for THE Tristan Miles lmao. Safe to say they were both not very happy with this encounter. ✨ Fate works in mysterious ways, doesn’t it? ✨➵2 DEVILS (FLETCHER & HARRY) & 1 ANGEL (PATRICK) FOR TRISTANI love how Tristan stepped up and filled in the missing father role for each of the boys. Tristan has such a special relationship with each of the kids and they are all so different.➵MY PROTECTIVE DARLING FLETCHER(to be updated upon re-read #3)➵MY WILD CHILD HARRY(to be updated upon re-read #3)➵MY SWEET LIL BABY PATRICK(to be updated upon re-read #3)➵DEAD-EX HUSBAND TROPElisten. I know the dead-ex trope is really hated and I usually hate it too, but for different reasons than others. I hate this trope, because every time it appears in a book, the dead husband/wife turns out to be a cheating/abusive/*insert everything negative here* asshole to make the Hero/heroine look better and not like a second choice and I, personally, hate that. Just let these people rest in peace.So I actually really liked how the dead-ex was handled in this book, cause Wade (the dead husband) seemed like a decent guy, good father and Claire loved him, but is ready to move on after 5 years. The author did a good job making it believable that Tristan is Claire’s love of her life without diminishing her love for her first husband.───── ⋆⋅☆⋅⋆ ─────0.5 STAR LESS....───── ⋆⋅☆⋅⋆ ─────➵CLAIRE ANDERSONthe only reason why this book is not getting the perfect score is because of the heroine. I like Claire, but I don’t love LOVE her and it’s bc she has some really annoying moments where she got on my nerves, especially at the beginning and towards the end with the ‘conflict’. I remember, when I read The Takeover for the first time, I struggled with the beginning a little bit, bc Claire was so rude towards Tristan. When guys are assholes and annoying it’s not as bad as when women are and I’m sorry cause I know that sounds fucking sexist. Not only is she 38, has 3 kids and is leading a media company, now she’s rude too?? There was literallynothingthat made me relate to Claire as a character.Claire freaking out at the end about Tristan wanting to buy a new house for them and wanting to adopt the kids was a bit unnecessary, even tho I can see where she was coming from, but since I’m 100% Team Tristan and he didn’t deserve to be hurt like that. Other than the beginning and the conflict thing I liked Claire. She was a good, hard-working mother and had such a cute relationship with all of her boys. Claire was the main reason why I rounded down the first time I read TT, but I wasn’t as annoyed with her on the reread and still loved everything else the same if not more I decided to round up.➵LOGIC WHERE???one scene at the end bothered me: when Harry and Patrick appeared at Tristan’s hotel in PARIS. how in hell did two under 14 year old kids managed to fly from NY to Paris ALL ON THEIR OWN? Which airline worker lets children fly across the world on their own? That just didn’t make any sense to me how these two managed that. Apparently Claire birthed two geniuses.( 🤡 rest to come upon re-read #3 🤡)┍━━━━━━━━»•» «•«━┑THE MILES HIGH CLUB SERIES#1 The Stopover – 2 stars (Jameson x Emily)#2 The Takeover – 4.5 stars (Tristan x Claire)#3 The Casanova – 3.5 stars (Elliot x Kate)#4 The Do-Over – 2.5 stars (Christopher x Hayden)#5 Miles Ever After – tbr (extended epilogue book for #1-#4)┕━»•» «•«━━━━━━━━┙
