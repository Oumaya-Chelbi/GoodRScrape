“I love you.” I feel his words in my heart and it begins to accelerate as excitement courses through me hearing those words fall from his lips. “Is that what you want to hear?” A smile finds my lips as he leans down and drags his mouth slowly across mine. “That I am so in love with you that it consumes me?” He presses his body against mine, lowering himself to press his knee between my legs and against my mound. “That you consume me?”QB Tyler....Miss ma'am*sigh*The way i was waiting for this book with my whole ass spread.-_-PLOT:Shay is a big actress and Damien is her big old bodyguard who loved her from the start and vice versa and he keeps her safe and he saves her from her crazy "stalker"And he saves her from the dangers of the weirdoAnd he saves herAnd he saves her from godAnd he saves her from goddamn everyoneYes, I’m attracted to him and I’d purposefully put on my tiniest bikini and strutted around him like I was presenting food to a starving man. Yes, I’ve always had a tiny crush on him that’s never gone away.Shay:She's so lame 😭See....I cannot form any opinion about her because she wasn't all that.She loved him and she came on too strongThe only thing i could tolerate about her was the fact that she was the reassuring type.Damien:Big block of sex who liked to keep her safe.Also was okay in communication.The book wasn't bad per say but it was.For a book being sold as forbidden, they fucked before you could blink.I couldn't even see forbidden because they were just being together in all time I've known.And i didn't like how they admitted that they loved each other,Because AGAIN it felt like it didn't build up at all.The book really stayed on a single wavelength from start to finish with no turns or upcourses.The "big twist"????A blind man could've seen it from a mile.I'm so sorry but oh my god i didn't like it at all.It was everything that i didn't expect it would be, in not a good way.ALSOThe INSANE amount of sex???NOT NEEDED. UNNECESSARY.THEY ARE MEANT TO BE FORBIDDEN SO KEEP IT FORBIDDEN“Do you prefer daddy?” I bite my bottom lip and his blue eyes darken giving me my answer. “Oh, daddy it is then,” I say, raising an eyebrow at him seductively.DO NOT use the word daddy if the book doesn't need it just for the sake of making it kinky.This book did not need the usage of the word daddy and that is coming from the whore herself.It threw me the fuck off when she said daddy because why would she say it.“I—I think I’m ready,” I tell him. “Your fingers can only prepare me for your dick so much.” I turn around and meet his eyes. “Nothing feels like your cock.”Please. Please. Please. Can we stop talking THIS much in smut scenes???They talked more than they fucked and it wasn't a good dirty talk.All in love.Not it for me
