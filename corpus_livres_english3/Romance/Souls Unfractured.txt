5 my babies ⭐️sSong :Dust To Dust“I used to wonder how two people—one broken girl, and one broken boy—could ever move on from their dark and tortured pasts. But now I know. Together, that’s how. They fight their way through… together.”My Google search historyHow to kill fictional characters?How to get inside a book and what weapons can you bring?How to revive dead fictional characters to kill them again? Slowly and painfully?The government agent monitoring meFlameandMaddiehave captured my heart from the very first book and I’ve been dying to get to them. And nowStory time AKA let’s talk about ✨me✨I’m a sponge first and a human second. One of those annoying people that absorb every emotion around them until they’re saturated with it. Those who are happy when people are happy. Who are sad when people are sad. Who spend sleepless nights thinking about every injustice, every wrong miserable painful thing going on in the world. Who stop watching the news because they can’t handle what’s being reported. Whose hearts constantly bleed for all those who just need a littlehelping hand, a littleloveand somecompassion; who just needsomeone.Flame’s flashbacks had me sleeping on my bathroom floor for an entire night, depleted of tears and energy.Rachel, I wouldn't have been able to do it without you. Thanks for being an amazing person and going through these ups and downs with me.🖤Knowing this is happening to millions of children out there?It kills me.Maddie and Flame’s storyReading this book was like walking into a war torn field. Every way you look, there is chaos, death, destruction and pain. The scene is so vivid, you can almost hear the echo of screams, smell the metallic odor of blood, see death take over and feel, feel as all hope is lost. The heavy cloying smoke surrounds you, and as you follow one of the delicate tendrils as it rises above- as if yearning to slip away from the horrors it witnessed down there- you realize that upon escaping to the vastness of the sky, it starts to depict a scene. To tell a story. You were too busy looking down at the results of a war raged between countries and nations, that you missed the one up there, fueled by the cruelty of one human towards another, on a lesser scale but no less significant.As you look closer, you see thousands of scenarios playing every single horrible thing humanity is capable of. You see it all and you can’t look away. You can’t look away as the father rapes his child, as the mother ignores hers, as the innocent prisoner is directed to his death, as a person is prosecuted for his race, color and beliefs while another dies from hunger, thirst and cold.The tendrils keep on ascending until they set in the sky, as if finally home. That’s when you understand that every star in the night sky is a pained soul who has left earth. The shinier the star, the more the soul has suffered. They’re there to comfort those in suffering, to light up their dark nights and tell them they’re there. They see them. They feel them. They’re looking out for them and they invite them to wish upon them.The realization brings you to your knees, and that’s when you see it. Underneath the dust and debris, sprouting from the slaughtered soil, standing delicately but fiercely in shining gold and spotless white, is a daisy. What is it doing there, and how has it survived, you wonder. How can something so beautiful, so vibrant, so pure, grow in a place so dark, so stagnant, so hopeless, you ask yourself. How can such light exist in such darkness? How can such beauty exist in such ugliness?Let me tell you, my friend, that daisy in the middle of a war torn field, illuminated by billions of stars is the union of two Souls Unfractured :Flameand hisMaddie.FlamePeople said I was a fucking freak. All my life they’d told me I was born wrong.“She would never want me. I’m a fucking retard. I don’t think right in here. I’m fucked up—I don’t get people, they don’t get me. And I ain’t ever gonna be able to read people. Why would someone as perfect as her want someone as fucked up as me? Someone who isn’t right in the head?”There’s nothing I hate more than hugs, but if I could find a way to get in this story, I would wrap myself around Flame and nevereverlet go.The things his piece of shit sperm donor did to him and made him feel.I held up my wrist to show him I was trying to get the flames out. That I didn’t need the church, that I could do it myself. I could get the flames out myself, if he would just let me try. But he just hit my wrist down, then struck me on the back of my head.He was angry with me, again. But I didn’t understand what I’d done to make him so mad? I tried. I always tried to make him happy. But it never worked. He just got madder. He just hurt me more and more. And I felt his disappoint deep inside me. I couldn't sleep, and all the worry made my hands shake. I… I was so confused. I didn’t mean to make him mad. I tried… I really, really tried.I have never, not once in my life, hated someone with this kind of passion. I don’t care if he’s not real, I just wannaMy baby went through so much and just going through my highlights has me sobbing again.“The flames hurt all of the time. They wouldn’t let me release them. They left me alone in a room, tied to a bed, letting the flames burn me alive.”He thinks he’s a monster with flames of evil in his blood. It’s what he’s been told since he was a child and what he believes to be true.No one ever wanted to stay. They always left. I was always here alone.Until his Maddie came along.Maddie had liked something on me? No one had ever liked me.She said she would care for me. No one had ever cared for me before.I knew she would leave. Because everyone left. No one ever wanted me for long.“With her beside me, I can sleep with no demons in my head. And she sings to me. To me. No one’s ever sang to me before.”He’s so sweet, so loving, so protective even tho he thinks his touch will hurt her.I looked at my rigid fingers. They looked just like everyone else’s, but they didn’t work the same. Because other people could touch someone else. They could’ve put their hand on her face after she’d said thank you. They could’ve felt her skin. They could’ve maybe made her feel better.But then the frustration filled my heart, and I thought, Your touch is poison. You’ll hurt her.But when he realized that he can, in fact, touch her?I didn’t want to leave her. I just wanted to be near her.I fucking just needed to be close.Evil still infused my body, but I could breathe. I panted. I sweated. But I could breathe. When I looked at her, I could breathe.“Your cheeks are blushing again. That means you liked it. You told me you blushed when you liked something. That I’d just made you feel special.” His lips rubbed together, and I could see his mind turning over. “You liked sleeping next to me. Because it made you feel special.”A smile crept on my lips. “Yes.”“I liked it too.”What the fuck were the stars and moon, when I had her?Me to him :And when he finally confronted his father??“I wasn’t a fucking sinner. I was fucking different. I am fucking different. My head doesn’t work right, like others. But it wasn’t a fucking sin, I wasn’t fucking evil, I was different.”“You owning that shit now?”“She owns me. That’s all that fucking matters.”MaddieThis girl isthe real MVP. She’s the proof that being broken doesn’t have to be who you are, your identity and your truth. You’re so much more. We’re so much more.She’s so much more.For a fleeting moment I had the silly thought that if I made myself small enough, that if I pressed myself against the wall as small as I possibly could, then the Elders might leave me alone.I instantly learned to dread that room. Then after a while, it became my life. And that’s when I died inside.I don’t think I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading about such a strong character. She’s apint-sized warrior, just like AK said.I shook with white-hot anger, incandescent at being ignored. I had been ignored enough in my life, pushed aside, thought of as weak and unimportant.Not now. Not today.“That is the beauty of freewill, Lilah. We choose our own actions. Unlike in commune, here we get to be the masters of our fate. I will go to Flame. Whatever transpires, transpires.”I think perhaps, if you are told something often enough, you end up believing it. But maybe, just maybe, someone comes into your life and makes you question yourself. Makes you believe you are worth something.”All she’s ever wanted was to feel safe, and with Flame, she does.I held my right hand in the air, and with my left hand, intertwined the fingers just to imagine how it might feel.A hand holding mine.One simple touch.A touch that said so much.I dare you to find me any hero who’s as swoon worthy as Maddie is.You are my faith awakened.“So you may think you cannot be loved. But in my heart, in my healing soul, I am begging the question, how can you not? Because for me, you are truth. My truth. My heart, is all you.”“I like you laughing.”I sighed and whispered, “And I just love you in any fashion.”Their love“We are Flame and Maddie. And we have survived.”How something so pure, so beautiful, so gentle can grow between two people who have been on the receiving end of such heinous acts, I have no idea. But it gives mehope.“Then what do you believe in?” he tentatively asked.Smiling through my tears, I said, “You. I believe in you.” Raising my head, my nose brushed his, and I confessed, “I believe in me. In us. We are all I need. All I’ll ever need from this point on.”Usually when two people are broken, one’s healing is overshadowed by the other’s. That did not happen here. These twosaved each other.“But I like you touching me. You make me feel safe.”“You cool my blood,” I replied.“For once, in my whole life, I like being me.”“Because of Flame?”“Mostly, yes. He has brought me to life. But through him, I feel more at peace with myself. Does that make sense?”It’s the little things. How she loves his eyes when everybody else says they’re dead and soulless. How he’s ready to follow her to the depths of his own personal hell, the church.“Are you ready?”“No,” he rasped.“But will you follow me?” I prompted.“Anywhere.”“I don’t ever remember being happy.”Fighting back tears, I whispered, “Then this is what we will hope for. Happiness... Because Flame?”“What?” he pushed, voice barely registering a whisper.“You are my happiness.”“I know I’m different. I know I don’t see the world like everyone else does. But I want to see your world, Maddie. Even if it’s the only one I’ll ever understand.”“I draw, and that makes me happy. I was wondering what makes you happy?”“I watch you.”“That is what makes you happy? To watch me? Does it not bore you? I am asking what makes you happy? What you like doing most?”Flame shook his head, then his eyes that I adored so much, met mine. “Being near you. Seeing you.”I can go on and on, but all you really need to know is thathe’s her Flame and she’s his Maddie. I imagine them both wrapped in gold like Japanese pottery, to highlight just how beautiful and imperfectly perfect they are. 🖤 Hopefully Flame doesn’t scream as much, because I’m afraid for my boy’s vocal chords. 🥺AK and VikingTheir love for Flame and their bond waseverything. I wish I could add quotes but I’m sure you’re cursing me by now for the long review, and GR is telling me I only have few characters left. 😭 Just know that will all my heart,I love AK and Viking. 🖤MaeUGH she gets on my every nerve, going on about how much she loves and cares for her sisters. Bitch, I’ve been in your head andRider/CainHe's too stupid to live. How he survived natural selection is beyond me. I don't hate him but he's irrelevant to me LOL.And finally, abreathtaking quoteby our pint-sized warrior queen.“What are words? Sometimes the flick of a pair of eyes or the flush of skin reveals everything you need to know. Words can wound. Silence can heal.”
