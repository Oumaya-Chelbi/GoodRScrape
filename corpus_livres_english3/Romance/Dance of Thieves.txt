I present to you -Dance ofThievesLiesAKA "The Tale of a proud Ballenger Family who gets bullied for being a proud family throughout the Entire History of the World,inc"WARNING: spoilers aheadThe Ballengers have a small landmass they have been occupying sinceforeverAncients' times. But no kingdom recognizes their right to rule and govern over their land. That's really unfortunate for the Ballengers, cuz they're located right between a few other kingdoms who all think that they have the right over Ballengers' territoryThe head of the family is a poor soulJase. A very proud family man, ready to do everything for his Family and for the people who live on his territory.He wants for his people to be safe, and for their right asthe first countryto be recognized.Doesn't want anything else.Good guy Jase.Ya know how he became theheadPatreiof the Ballenger clan? His father (ex-Patrei) has acknowledged that Jase was the best at seeing through the lies of other people. And so Jase is.... for the first 50 pages or so(and this book is atrocious 500 which reads likeat the very leasttwice as much)WhenJasemeetsKazi, he spots many of her lies right away.Then he thinks to himself:"Yes! I'm sooo good at spotting these lies! I've always been good at spotting lies! Wait a second... I wonder why she doesn't want to tell me the truth?"Aaaaaaand then he falls in love with her andBELIEVES. EVERY. WORD. SHE. SAYS. EVEN. WHEN. SHE. CONTRADICTS. HERSELF.When Kazi never wants to talk about her past, he is like:"Naaah. I'm sure it's fine". He doesn't ask Kazi why she's on Ballengers territory cuz" I'm sure it's fine".. Even though he knows that she is from another Kingdom,serves another Queen(JasethinksKaziis enrolled in the military) who doesn't even recognize the Ballengers' right to their Kingdom, it's allI'm sure it's fine, no way you and your military friends are foreign invadors.Even when he getsevidence after evidencethat Kazi or her friends are doing something dodgy, it's allfine with him.So, there'sKaziof Brightmist. A thief hired bysome Queento find a criminal man and... steal him?(???)and bring the man tothe Queenfor justice. AndKazibelieves thatJaseis hiding that man somewhere in The Ballenger "kingdom", and that the man was doing crimes onJase'sorders.Kaziis notjust a thief, but aKICKASS SUPER-MEGAthiefwho is rude, loud and super annoying.Somewhere in the first 30% of the book she thinks smth like"I'm calm. I am good at keeping myself calm, not showing emotions, nothing can surprise me, I'll keep a calm mask no matter what, like I always do"And this is Kaziliterallya page later:And every time she doesn't like something, she starts screaming, makes assumptions, and accusesthe Ballenger familyof all crimes against humanity, never giving anyone a chance to justify themselves becausescrew these guys.Kaziis aGIANT LIAR, never mentions anything real about her. She lies toJaseforthe entire book(up until the end),neverspeaks one truth about herself, about what she wants, about what her goal is. Besides that, she goes behindJase'sback to pursue her goals, goes behind Jase's family's backs, although the Ballengers seem to care about her a great deal.YETwhen she sees something that goes against her personal philosophy,when she thinks she is being lied toshe starts screaming atJase, makes accusations, punches him (likeactualfist-to-the-face), makes a scene in public without givingJasea chance to explain himself - and that has happened a few times throughout the book. Because apparentlyJaseis supposed to be a mind-reader and know what her problems are with everything...Women, am I right? Always thinking that men are some mind-readers who know exactly why the woman is upsetI mean...Jasedoes "hide" some things fromKazi,BUTsince shenever explainswhy she is in his Kingdom,never expresses interestin certain topics... can you really blame the guy for not telling Kazi absolutely every single detail of how he governs his Kingdom? So, why does Jase "hide" things from Kazi?MAYBE IT'S CUZ KAZI NEVER ASKS? MAYBE?JUST MAYBE A LITTLE BIT?Just throwing it out there....She acts like aspoiled entitled brat- which is surprising, because her upbringing is very humble..Oh, she also is aHUGE hypocrite. She accuses the Ballengers of many horrible things (most of which turned out to be either not true or simple misunderstandings)... when she herself is guilty ofthe same crimes.One of the things she accusesJase and his familyof isthievery.YEP, OUR MISSsuper mega thief Kaziaccuses someone else of being athief...This is what poor soulJasehas to say in response:"Don't. Don't even try to deny it. It's all obvious now... It's ironic, don't you think,all that self-righteous indignationyou flung at me becauseIwas a thieving Ballenger. I should be laughing, shouldn't I?"Here's another quote that confirms how badKazi and her friendsare, and how pure and poor the Ballengers are:(The situation is:Kazifinallyunderstands how stupid she is, goes toJaseto talk about bad men who were actually behind every crime she thought was the Ballengers'. This is what he answers):"You're telling me, they infiltrated my house under false pretenses, violated my family's trust, put them at risk, ate our food, slept in our beds, used us, made promises they had no intention of keeping, betrayed us....So tell me, how are they different fromyou?"Besidesthe most horrible main female character, a few other things that really pissed me off:-the book is atrociously long. It's only 500 pages, but it feels as thought it's waaaay more than that. Not a lot of things are happening, besidesKaziacting stupid.- There're about20-30 charactersin the book, most of whom have 2 syllable names, who constantly appear on the pages, and honestly, I couldn't remember who was who and couldn't give a damn about any of them.-Conversations got sidetrackeda lot. I expected the characters to talk about ABC, but they'd end up talking about smth else all together.- It's alsoan incredibly slow read. I've been sick for 3 days straight, doing almost nothing but reading the book, and still, it took me so long to finish it. I'd expect to make the same progress on a George Martin'saSoIaFnovel, but not on this poor excuse of a "high fantasy"Oh, and the reason why I even started reading this book, is because I was hinted that there was a goodromanceline here, and although I didn't have my hopes high, I was still extremely disappointed by the romance. I want to blame it all onKazi, because with a character like her, you can't really expect a healthy relationship... but I didn't likeJaseeither, since both of them are POVs in this book. I didn't really see their love, I didn't like the way their relationship were described by the author and it felt a bit insta-lovey(which is an achievement of its own bc the book is atrociously long), and their love wasblind, especially fromJase'sside.
