❌Rating amended to 1 star because I used to feel bad about 1-star-ing a new book. Well, it’s not new anymore. I also no longer suffer under the delusion that I need to lie to spare a book from a low rating.❌I’ll leave the 1 star for the writing style. Pity there’s no zero star option…🚨💯FREE ON AMAZON 8 FEB 2022🚨💯 - The true cougar.⭐️UPDATE:⭐️Thoroughly enjoyed the writing style.The age gap is too big for my comfort (even for me, considering I have five, four and three starred this trope in at least 25 books already); he’s just too young and she’s just to weary.I want to bash this book because the heroine is a pathetic (her words AND his) creep, but I’m enjoying the writing style, inner dialogue, and I want to know how this pans out.Loads of red flags:Red flag no 1:She’s bored. Unfulfilled. Horny, and not in a “you-go-gurrrl” way.8 years ago (he was 10 and she was 24) she was instrumental in putting his father behind bars.That ONE case was the beginning and end of her career as a journalist.Since then she’s been chasing the same high but hasn’t reached it.She’s now teaching because she desperately needs a change.Red flag no 2:Can’t say I’ve read many H’s who don’t immediately feel attraction to the h.Not asking for insta lust or love.Physical attraction or some sort of chemistry, yes, pls.I’m not used to lukewarm from the heroes POV:“she’s not bad-looking for a woman in her thirties. I don’t age discriminate—I’ve been with ladies her age. And if she wasn’t such a heinous bitch, I’d probably hit that.”AND“The only difference between the way I feel now and the way I felt at ten is that I used to hate her for what she did to my family—but now, as I watch her sulk out the door in misery, I realize I hate her for how pathetic she is.”AND“She was a spitfire, full of angst and hate. But now, this woman I’ve seen twice today, is just…sad”Red flag no 3:Her:“I try my hardest not to check out my scantily clad students, but it’s not easy.”Him:“Life has gotten a little boring, hasn’t it? Your job was boring, so you picked a new one. Going home alone on a Friday night is boring. Now you’re eye-fucking a bunch of college students”NTS:Edit edit edit 👆🏽👆🏽👆🏽
