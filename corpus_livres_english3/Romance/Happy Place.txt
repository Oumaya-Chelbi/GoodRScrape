➸4.25 stars”in every universe, it’s you for me.even if it’s not me for you.”— alexa, play maroon by taylor swift.can’t believe emily henry had the audacity to write a book about me!! ms emily reached inside my brain and took out parts of my life to write this book, it’s uncanny. i am constantly overwhelmed with how she can take the most deepest inner emotions of a person and articulate it in a way that is so relatable it makes the reader feel seen. i just love how she describes the complexity of adult life!did i finish this book or did this book finish me? even though this book is called“happy place”i’m just here to warn you that this book will not necessarily make youhappy.the audacity of EH to even call it that when this book fucking crushed me to pieces, ripped my heart out of chest, stomped on it 928482 times and then flung it into the ocean. this story explores heavy topics, it’s filled with love and loss, grief, hurt, trauma, change, happiness and unhappiness + friendships and family; this book was more melancholy, thoughtful and deep—this is ultimately why i loved it sm!— this story is narrated by harriet and it is alternated between apastandpresenttimeline, and explores how this tight-knit friend group met and harriet’s life since then. the parallels constantly left me in awe! we also become immersed in wyn and harriet’s past relationship and we are taken back to how they first met and fell in love.the past chapters are shown to be harriet’s “happy place” which is when her time is spent at a cottage in maine — an annual trip she takes with her boyfriend and best friends.”you are in all of my happiest places. you are where my mind goes when it needs to be soothed.”— second chance romance trope is honestly one of my favourite tropes, but only when it’s done well. i need to feel the connection between both characters, what made them fall apart and their journey finding their way back to each other, and i can say this book excelled at that. this book had me feeling all the feels. literally the PINING in this omg and the ANGSTTT and the pain, my poor lil heart couldn’t take it all. wyn and harriet were so torn up over each other, but they are so bad at communicating their vulnerability to one another. the chemistry between them is palpable despite the fact they’re not together anymore.PSA: this book relies heavily on past miscommunication/lack of communication so if you’re a miscommunication hater like me, be aware. these two are so broken and damaged, i couldn’t hate on it. harriet has a tendency to push everyone away, including wyn; and wyn has a tendency to worry and overthink things—which in time ended up clashing together but it was handled so immaculately, i found it bearable and i just wanted to see them both get their happy ending.➳harriet kilpatrick:harriet is me, i am her. she puts other peoples needs and feelings before her own to keep the peace. the way she has an inability to show others her emotions, especially during the break up bc she fears she will be a burden really hit close to home. her character was frustrating at times, but nonetheless she was so loveable and understandable bc her upbringing and family dynamic affected her as she grew up. she was never taught how to fight with the ones she loves and that took a toll on the way she communicates in relationships. but i just constantly wanted to grab her by the shoulders, shake her and scream “YOU ARE ENOUGH” i love her character sm, it was definitely bc i related to her in an unnerving way *cough*i also hate my job.her love for wyn was devastatingly beautiful, the way she loves and feels is so deep.➳wyn connor:wyn, wyn, wyn, oh how i love u. when his love language is physical touch 🤭 i died at that. my soul left my body and descended to heaven, not even joking- he’s my baby boy fr. we see his character as very self conscious and never believes in himself, we can see that he feels he is not enough for harriet and his self doubt instincts always take over but he loves HARD. on that topic; i didn’t understand how he can love so hard, but walk away so quickly without fighting for harriet, but it makes sense since they’re so bad at communicating 🥲— ms henry wrote another swoon-worthy character who is deeply flawed but loveable at the same time. i just love the way EH handles mental health topics and always manages to give so much emotional depth to her characters.꒰wyn and harriet:꒱i love both of their characters and i was rooting for them the entire book!! the witty banter and sarcasm between them had me giggling fr. you could feel the connection between them both, they are soulmates!! they both ache for each other and you can feel it all pour out of the pages. harriet and wyn are so different from each other—yet so similar, this is why they instantly connected with one another. i just love how EH made their conflict realistic and not forced and dragged out. we see them both focus on their self-growth and healing, but seeing harriet go through her self-discovery journey and then finding her way back to wyn has me in my feels rn, it just felt so real. 🥹“i thought i made you […] just by wishing.”➷ the friendships and connections in this book is so strong, but it also tackles how friendships can change over time as adult friendships can become so difficult to maintain as you age with everyone being in different stages in their life. i loved seeing this group navigate through it all, i crave a friendship like what they all have even though it’s dysfunctional and the conflict would be over lack of communication was juvenile but it made it feel so much more real. my main take from this was thatfriendships are love stories too. i just love platonic love!! also, the theme of found family runs so deep in this story, she executed it so perfectly >>>— overall, this book was phenomenal and i absolutely adored it, EH writing is just *chefs kiss* if you’re looking for a romance galore book i’m sorry to say this book isn’t for you, this book explores more about a friend group and their dynamics, growing up and letting go. i will keep saying, HER BOOKS ARE 100% MORE WOMEN’S FICTION, THE ROMANCE IS JUST A PLUS!!— but, i wasn’t a fan of the ending honestly.. it was really rushed and it didn’t fit harriet’s character; the decision she made fr left me shocked lmao. she threw all that away for a hobby, in this economy?? girl- 😳🧍🏻‍♀️──────────────────────────damn, she got me again!! no thoughts, just tears rn. EH, i will hunt you down for making me endure so much pain. rtc 😔❤️‍🩹──────────────────────────happyhappy placerelease day to my emily henry girlies!! this is a big day for us all. now bring me the angst, pain and tears.
