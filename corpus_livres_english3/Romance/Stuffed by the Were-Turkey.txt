Note:Some of my goodreads shelves can be spoilersOverall: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (Judge me)Readability: 📖📖📖📖 (It’s short!)Feels: 🦋 (I can’t say it gave me any good feelings)Emotional Depth: 💔💔 (It’s very short)Sexual Tension: ⚡⚡Romance: 💞💞Sensuality: 💋💋💋Sex Scene Length: 🍑🍑🍑🍑 (It’s basically the whole book, but the book is very short)Steam Scale (Number of Sex Scenes): 🔥Humor: Come on, the whole thing is hilariousPerspective: Third person from the heroine’s POVCliffhanger: No, but it doesn’t really end completely or on a happily ever after or happy for now. But I don’t think there’s more to come. I hope?Epilogue: NoWhen mains are first on page together: 8% in (a page or two into the story)Format: read e-book version through kindle unlimited(Descriptions found at end of my review)Should I read in order?This is a stand alone.Basic plot:Just read the title!Give this a try if you want:- ‘monster’ romance??- vegan heroine- were-turkey hero/human heroine- instalust- Thanksgiving vibes- you’ve read every other book on the planet and have reached this point- mid to higher steam – it’s basically one scene but it’s almost the whole book (12-13 pages?)Ages:- I hope that turkey was old enough to consent!First line:“Stop senseless murder! Animals deserve to live too!" Josette yelled, waving her sign in the faces of everyone that went into the turkey farm.My thoughts:I like to keep my historical romance followers on their toes by throwing stuff like this in there 😂Did I hate it? No! Of course I discovered all sorts of things I never want to read again, but still I laughed, I cringed, I had self reflection on what points got me to this point in life...4 stars!Cock/Hero Stats:- I mean...he’s a turkey- but he changes...he shifts into having a cock and hands. No nipples or belly button- he has tiny feathers on his body that look like fuzzy hair- HE KEEPS THE TURKEY HEAD NOOOOOOOOOOOO- huge cock “as big as a coke can at its thickest”Quotes/thoughts:(Any mistakes are my own)But those strong hands gripped her breasts, kneading them as strongly as she had the quinoa meatless loaf earlier.Content warnings:(This should be taken as a minimum because I could have missed some!)- I mean isn’t this whole book a content warning?? 🤔 Content warning for turkey man sexLocations of kisses/intimate scenes:Safe sex?Oh not in any way35% - some humping from the turkey man, then she escapes, he chases her down and doggy styles her on the floor, then they move to the table – her ass in the mashed potatoesExtra stuff like what my review breakdowns mean, where to find me, and book clubsFull break down on what my ratings above mean here:Overall:How I felt about it everything considered!Readability:How ‘readable’ was the book? Did I fly through it? Did I have to tell myself to pick it back up repeatedly? Were any passages confusing? (I will probably score like (1) is literally unreadable due to formatting/typing errors, etc (2) There were lots of errors that made it difficult to read OR It was extremely confusing and I had to reread passages to make sense of it OR I disliked it so much I had to bribe myself to keep reading (3) I didn’t really want to keep reading and would have preferred to abandon the read and start something else OR some minor continuity issues/confusion (4) I liked it fine, maybe a minor error or 2. I was happy to pick it up when I had time. (5) I never wanted to put this down. I thought about it when I wasn’t reading it. I hid in the bathroom from my kids to read. I threw inappropriate food at my children for dinner so I could read instead.)Feels:Totally subjective to each person but did the book give me any tingles? Any butterflies? Did it rip my heart out (in a good way?)Emotional depth:How well do I feel I know the characters at the end? How much did I feel their emotions throughout the story?Sexual tension:Again, subjective, but how strong was the wanting and longing to me between the characters? A book might have strong sexual tension without a single touch.Romance:Was there romance? Did romantic things happen? This can be actions/words/thoughts of the characters and again is subjective.Sensuality:This is how the intimate scenes are written. Kisses and sexual scenes – how sensual were they? Were they on the mechanical side? Was there emotional pull tied in? Were the details explicit or flowery? These are subjective but generally (1) too short to get a good judgement (2) not all what I'm looking for - very vague or flowery prose (3) either not explicit enough or not enough emotional pull (too mechanical/physically descriptive without the emotions) (4) what I love in a scene (5) absolute perfection - perfect balance of emotional longing and explicit descriptionsSex Scene Length:How long the bedroom scenes are (generally (1) is 1-3 sentences (2) is a few paragraphs to a page-ish (3) is about average, a few pages (4) more well developed scenes, quite a few pages with descriptions (4) the majority of the book takes place in the bedroom. This is always hard to tell for me on audio!Steam Scale:Generally, each flame is a scene. If scenes are super close together I sometimes combine them. If a scene is super short or so vague I don’t know what’s happening, I don’t count it. There’s some levels of grey but generally the number of flames is how many sex scenes there are (I max out at 5 so I’ll put a + after if there’s more than that)Find meInstagram||The Storygraph||BookbubBook ClubsThe Ton and the Tartans(Historical Romance)Upturned Petticoats and Undone Cravats(Historical Romance with Steam Requirements)A Love Less Ordinary(Science Fiction, Paranormal, Monster, Fantasy Romance)Modern Manuscripts(Contemporary Romance)Words for the Wicked(Contemporary Romance with Steam Requirements)Vintage Romance(Old School Romance – published 2000 and prior)
