Drama. Llama. 😩This was a lot.I wanted Lee to make Kyle grovel, but after a bit, I got really annoyed. I don't understand Lee's motivations most of time. Her choices don't make a lot of sense. 🤷🏼‍♀️And Kyle? 👀 Poor guy. He's trying, but either he gets tripped up or he f*cks up... He makes some really perplexing and maddening choices as well. There's a scene were he once again chooses to deal with OW, rather than telling her to eff off and go after the h... and that's really where this book lost a star. His actions made no sense to me, and his reasoning in his head made me furious. He doesn't cheat on Lee, but his priorities are all askew.The ending is a heartbreaker. 😭😭😭😭😭Bottom Line? The back and forth and stupid decisions by the MCs really dragged this book down. I still enjoyed the ride with all the fun drama and b*tching to my book buddy... but at the end of the day, I would expect these idiots to have learned from their past issues.... and they haven't yet, and that's real frustrating. 3.5 stars.⚠️SAFETY SQUAD SPOILERS⚠️- no cheating or sharing- OW drama in spades. She's straight evil and she pops up every time Lee and Kyle seem to be pulling it together. I'd like to see her die a slow painful death.- OM drama - the h keeps inexplicably running to the the H's sh*t stain brother... even though she's well aware of his role in their misery- no dubcon- death of important side character- MC's are actively grieving the twin that was miscarried in the first book
