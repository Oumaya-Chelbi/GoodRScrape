Reread 2021 - I feel like my heart has been through a blender. 😫😫😫This book is just filled to the brim with all the drama and angst, and ends on a sh*tty cliffhanger.I whined through the whole thing. B*tching and moaning to my long-suffering reading buddy. 🤣Random observations:Kyle is such an @$$hole!This Rachel b*tch is the wooooorrrrrrrst! Die! Die! Die!Oh poor sweet Lee. You darling dumb-dumb. Poor lamb.*Clutches Pearls* Well, DAAAAAAAMMMN, Kyle! 👀 look at you with the jealous/ possessive *dir-tay talk* 🥵🥵🥵Oh nooooooooooooo!!!! 😱😱😱😩😩😩😩😩😭😭😭I can’t take it.I can’t.My poor tortured baby, Kyle. 😢😢😢🥺Bottom Line? Did I want to DNF every other chapter of this REREAD? Hell. Yes. Did I love it? Also, yes. Will I reread the next book? Absolutely. After I give my poor beat up heart a rest. 💔 🤡⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 1/2 — I could take everything except where he left Lee to walk home from work alone for WEEKS after he took her v-card. I know he was avoiding her, but that was a step too far for me. 😬 He could have at least followed her like a sad sack to be sure she got home ok. 🤷🏼‍♀️ Sorry, Kyle, you lose half a star. 😅⚠️SAFETY SQUAD SPOILERS⚠️*DEEP BREATH*- cheating? Ummm… no-ish? Really depends on how you define it. If you require absolute fidelity after they meet, this isn’t for you. This situation is *complicated* The H kisses the h and has several heavy petting sessions before they are committed and he is still whoring around… for *reasons* - he’s trying very hard to resist her 🤷🏼‍♀️ it’s not a black and white situation.- no sharing- aaaaaallll the OW drama - there’s an Evil Cackling Whore who has him by the balls, basically blackmailing him… it’s all but rape 🤷🏼‍♀️ - he is also sleeping with OP… as both a middle finger to the psycho OW, but also in a desperate attempt to stay away from the h… *REASONS*- OM drama - H gets crazy jealous over anyone who looks at the h. 😍😍😍😍- no dubcon - besides the H being coerced into sex with OW- h is a virgin- H is a manwhore — HOWEVER - he always wraps it up. It’s an important plot point. 👌🏻- domestic violence against the h by OP (flashbacks)- attempted sexual assault against the h by OP (flashbacks)- miscarriage - on page
