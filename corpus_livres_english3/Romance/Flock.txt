4.5/5 ★’s“my rainy days are yours, dominic. if you want them.”rereading this trilogy is something i told myself i would never do, but i’m so happy that i changed my mind (with lots of help from my pookie, bru hehe this reread is for you🫂and to convince shei and sel to read this immediately🔪). it almost feels like my first time reading it because i seriously don’t remember a whole lot about this trilogy and i think those who have read it can understand why. the first time i read flock, i gave it 5 stars. as much as i enjoyed it the second time around, there were just some minor things that prevented me from giving it 5 stars again. revisiting these characters (one in particular) is something i didn’t know that i needed🥹if you’re questioning yourself on whether or not you should pick this series up or even reread it yourself…i 10/10 recommend!!<3♡ the plot:captivating. if you know me, you know i will always recommend going into a book completely blind. i don’t want to say any specific details about the plot. i just want to say that it’s very cryptic. i remember my first time reading it and being kind of confused with what was going on so you really just need to go with the flow because everything will get explained eventually, i promise. you’ll think the plot is going somewhere, you’ll think that you know what’s going on and then it’ll make a complete 180 and go in the opposite direction. it’s the kind of plot that keeps you wondering what the hell is going on and even my second time reading this book…it still had that same effect. i’ll leave you with this, if you’re looking to read a reverse harem romantic suspense set in a small town then this is absolutely the trilogy for you🤭♡ the writing:live, laugh, love words. so so good. i don’t know how a lot of the quotes didn’t stick with me when i first read this trilogy. kate has a way of making you feel all different kinds of emotions. i definitely appreciate an author’s writing a lot more than i used to. back then, i used to just read for fun. i still read for fun of course, but to me it’s much more than that. i read to feel something…to feel everything because feeling so deeply makes me feel so alive and i crave it more and more everyday. the fact that simple words written on paper have the ability to do that!? it’s the most beautiful thing. so yeah i absolutely love kate’s writing style hehe 10/10, absolutely consumed<3♡ cecelia horner:༻“i expect passion and butterflies, and one or two fairy tale moments. when we fight, i want it to hurt. when we fuck, i want to feel it with every fiber of my being. when a man confesses his love to me, i expect him to mean it. i don’t want to question the words’ authenticity. i want to be claimed and owned and ruled and possessed by love. is that expecting too much?”༺i absolutely adore cecelia. i love her heart. i do feel that she had some flaws, but that’s what makes her character development throughout the trilogy so good🤌we start by seeing cecelia at age 19 and then see her at age 26 and let me tell guys…her story is definitely one you want to read about! she has all of the good qualities you want in a fmc🥰♡ dominic king:༻“so what, i'm attracted to dominic. of course, i'm attracted to him. he's got that beautiful asshole vibe thing that makes women stupid.”༺as some of you know, based on my updates…i am a slut for dominic king🫦this man could break me in half and i’d ask him to do it again. there’s always something about a fictional man who is an absolute asshole to the fmc, but then turns soft for her later on that will always win me over. it’s my favorite thing ever like yes baby, peel back those layers so i can see deep into your core the kind of gentleman you really are😩you ask me to list my top book bf’s and you WILL find dominic being one of them, always. let me just tell you all that i fell even move in love with dom this time around🤭dominic king just has that toe curling, thigh clenching, butterflies in the tummy, swoon worthy effect that every romance girly needs to read about immediately🙈you won’t regret it! this man is french AND he’s a reader🤰even tho this man is an asshole to cecelia…he still does gentleman things like open the car door for her🫦it’s giving treat her like a princess in public and like a slut in private😋usually i share my book bf’s, but sorry besties…this man is mine🤗🔪♡ sean roberts:༻“so, you hate the plant, huh, pup?” sean drawls as i watch dominic sift through his toolbox.“stop calling me that,” i say, elbowing him in the ribs.“nope, the nickname stays.”“it's just...so fucking boring,” i sigh.༺HEAVY on the sigh and the “so fucking boring”. if you’re wondering why my rating went from 5 stars to 4.5, it’s because of this man right here. the first time i read it…i won’t lie, i definitely swooned over him so i don’t have any doubt that most of you won’t feel the same way when you first read it. my second time around tho…i just couldn’t stand him. he was boring. every time he was talking about something, i just wanted him to shut the fuck up😭there was one specific scene…actually a few scenes where he pissed me off so much and i was just like yeahhhh fuck this guy😂i mean some of the things he says is swoon worthy, but idk. he’s blonde. he has a lip ring. not my cup of tea. also that nickname…i hate it😭♡ other thoughts:there’s one side character that deserves to be mentioned and that’s tyler. i heard he’s getting his own book and i simply cannot wait. i absolutely adore him🤗the ending was so unexpected even my second time reading it because i could barely remember what happened. i need to start reading the second book immediately now because i’ve forgotten so much😭the small town setting…absolutely loved the vibes hehe. please go read this if you haven’t <3 if you hate it…pls forget my name🫣♡ favorite scenes:#1:slowly, i move to get up when he buries his nose in my hair, hooking me back into him. i draw audible breaths as he finally acknowledges the bulge in his sweats and the raging current between us. clinging desperately to my will, i start to speak up when he beats me to it.“no.”i turn my head, drinking in the lust that greets me and know this ‘no’ has everything to do with my questions last night. our eyes stay locked as his grip tightens on my waist.“i know what i'm holding, i know her worth,” he whispers, his words so intimate.~~~this is so beautiful that i literally want to cry right now🥹🦋#2:“have you ever been in love?”silence.“that's not a stupid question.”“it is if you find love irrelevant.”“why is love irrelevant?”“because it doesn't interest me.”“what interests you?”“the book i was reading.”i huff and move off his lap to pick the book up before i hand it to him. he resumes his reading as i move for his door.“pick one,” he says just as i reach the handle."one what?"he nods toward the shelves.i run my hands over my face in frustration. “you drive me insane.”i move toward the shelf and look over his collection. i pause when i see a few familiar titles. “you have a whole romance section.” i giggle and pull a book from the shelf. when i open it, a receipt falls to the floor. inspecting it, i see he’s just bought ten books and spent a few hundred dollars opting for some pricy hardcovers over paperbacks. “you just bought these?”upon closer inspection, i see most of them are romance titles by my favorite indies. there’s also a few suspense and an older historical, all of them titles from a familiar list that i wrote on a bookmark in my bedroom. when he was in my house, he had to have snooped in my room while sean was distracting me.“you looked through my stuff?”he keeps his eyes on his book.it’s a stupid question. and the answer is so obvious, but i can't help myself.“you bought these for me?”silence.and again, i’m floating off the ground as he continues to read, feigning indifference. but i know differently now, and it changes everything. beneath that mask is a man who's been paying attention, very close attention to me.he turns another page and pulls an empty pillow closer to his shoulder. he wants me to read, with him, in his bed. and what better way to pass a day in stormy weather than curling up with a gorgeous man and getting lost in the words.~~~the way i would’ve begged him to take me right then and there. i- let me stop😂😂#3:i turn the radio down and he glances at me. “are we ever going to have a real conversation?”one side of his mouth lifts. “we had a good one not too long ago.”“that's not what i mean.”“want to start with politics or religion?” he chuckles darkly at my answering scowl before he shifts, pinning me to my seat as we race forward. “eggs—runny, coffee—black, beer—cold, music—loud, cars,” he floors the gas.“fast,” i say through a laugh.“woman,” he turns and rolls his mirror colored gaze over me.woman, not women. i feel that comment so much i move to grip his hand.~~~SWOONINGGGG🦋🦋#4:i feel a kiss on my stomach, my eyes drift from the page when he jerks me to the edge of the bed, spreading my legs.“keep reading.”~~~sneak peak of a spicy scene🫦🫦pls i died.#5:chapter 25 owns me, go read this book to find out why🥵♡ favorite quotes:༻ “you’re perfect.” 🦋🦋🦋༻ “i could spend eternity kissing this man. it's intense, sinful, consuming, along with a whisper of something else.” 🫦༻ “it's beautiful, this man's kiss. it's consuming and i can't get enough.”༻ “my greatest hope is to be in all-consuming love. my biggest fear is to be in all-consuming love.” so so real🥺༻ “we crave the all-consuming, soul-stealing, drama-filled romances that are destined to end badly.”༻ “you can discover more about a person in an hour of play than you can in a year of conversation.”༻ “these two men have flipped my world, made colors more vivid, made sounds sweeter, made the world as a whole more bearable.”༻ “it’s okay to want his dick, baby, i’ll watch it go inside you and fucking love the view, and the savage it’ll make me.” oh-👀༻ “they won’t touch you, cecelia. you pulled up with dominic.” period😛༻ “i don't think I've ever seen dom so wrapped up in any woman.” can he be wrapped up in me next😩༻ “my eyes close in remembrance of the past few hours of being at his mercy. i'm sore, more than sore, i've been fucked to within an inch of living.”༻ “deeply. so deeply, i struggle for air, for sanity, as he takes and takes and i open for him, my limbs going lax. in his kiss, i lose a part of myself, his words lifting me above ground while his tongue coaxes me into this moment with him.” the way dom kisses…i simply cannot😩༻ “elle est trop belle. trop intelligente. mais trop jeune. cette fille sera ta perte...” she is too beautiful. too smart. but too young. this girl will be your undoing. 🫠♡ old
