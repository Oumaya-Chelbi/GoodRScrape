Corrupt - 2.5 starsHideaway - 2.5 starsKill Swith - currently readingNightfall - tbr2,5 very conflicted ⭐️sThis rant is one big spoilerFirst of all, I would've never finished this if it wasn't forthe lovely Arena. So thank you, girl, for making this journey fun and marveling at the stupidity of some of these characters with me. 💖I hope you fall in love with Damon even more in Kill Switch. 🙈Speaking of Damon, I don’t know any Russian men in my life, but these Russian heroes are justsuperior(if you haven’t metChristian AllisterandMaksimilian Sevastyan, idk what you’ve been doing with your life but it ain’t it).Damon Torrenceis an intriguingRussiancharacter, but not only is he Russian (enough to get me on board, tbh), he’s also a villain, a tortured, broken, went-through-hell-and-made-people-go-through-hell anti-hero.Mix all of that togetherAnd you’ve got yourselfIn my mind, he’sEmmet Cullenfrom TwilightHe really is himJustoh no, Damon, nothing really. Just OUR HEARTS!!!!*room becomes strangely silent**looks around, notices everybody staring likewhat is she going on about**visible confusion**checks teeth for lettuce**remembers book* *eyes fall over blurb*Uhhh, wait a sec!!! This book is about Kai and Banks???Because it sure didn’t feel like it.To be completely honest, I’m still not 100% sure how I feel about this book.I liked some parts, disliked others, hated some and rolled my eyes at most.And y’all are trapped with me, so let’s do this.*evil laugh for the fact you just realized this review hasn’t even started yet*So this is Banks and Kai’s story*cough* not *cough*.Devil’s Night, six years ago, Kai meets Banks and feels an instant connection to her. Stuff happens (eloquent as always, as you can see), life goes on and in the present, they meet again. Luckily, “their connection” is still there.Therein lies my first problem: what connection exactly are you talking about, especially in the present?? I don’t like instant-anything (ffs he told her she was his the same night) but Itriedto get over it in the flashbacks.I even decided that when I asked “when did you connect?”, Banks answered me.The confessional. The trunk. The Bell Tower. The grave. Small spaces with him. Always small, dark spacesbut what about the present??“But not around you. Around you, I get hungry. Like I’m starving.”Okay but, like, when did this happen?Me, the entire book, looking for clues to understand how and when they connected in the presentThe Characters (warning : rant about things I didn’t like about them)➩Kai MoriWhy do male heroes in this series stand out in other books but almost never in their own? Kai didn’t hold my interest at all as a person, and his character building was flaky, IMO (but he did have his moments). So he’s this really deep thinker, strategist, silent, whatever guy and he’s such a sad puppy because he disappointed his dad. But then he’s this dark person who supposedly does dark things, that is cunning, ruthless and dangerous. You guys, he likes to watch!!!!Because he’s so scary, here’s the rule to avoid his dark side :make sure to never close your blinds.The only one, really.He compares Banks to the ✨flawless Rika ✨I’d been captivated by our Little Monster, because she reminded me of Banks.Spoiler alert : he does. Repeatedly!!He’s incredibly possessive.“You’re out of your mind?” Kai pushed in, inching into Michael’s space. “I don’t share.”2 pages later“Take off her boxers, Rika,” Kai suddenly said in a husky voice.Does Rika, like, not count as a person because she’s a woman?? What is this fuckery?HonestlyI’m impressed I even have something to say about him, tho, because he was so meh that Michael outshined him in a scene.“I love you guys,” Michael said, “but are you fucking dense? You’re my friends. She is everything. Maybe someday you’ll know what the fuck I’m talking about.”When Michael Drywall Crist stands out more than you, you know it’stime to go home.✨Pro Tip✨Don’t call a woman “kid” when your head is between her thighs, please and thank you.➩Nikova BanksBanks is a character (I loved than hated)x10 than I don’t know anymore.Here she is in a pictureIs it the shy, mousy Banks that was indoctrinated by her brother all her life, wearing baggy clothes and binding her chest to hide, only tosuddenlyget naked in front of Michael and Rika??Or it the ballbuster, sassy, strong Banks that is sooo much better than the horsemen and Rika, but one taste of their peculiar sexual activities and she’s one of them??She bitch slaps Rika (which brings joy to my heart because I dislike Rika 🙈) but uh why exactly?? Because she had a threesome with Michael and Kai? I’ll never be okay with that threesome but I’m sorry, when she does it “she’s a bitch and Michael has no pride”, but when you end up kissing her, its okay because “you’re freeing yourself and blah fucking blah” ??You’re jealous, okay, we get it but aren’t you supposed to be this good person?? What “good person” thinks this knowing what Damon put Rika through?I hate her right now for making me defend Rika, btw.but God, I hoped he was going to do everything he could to make trouble for her now.And because she’s delusionalIs she okay? Your little princess threw the first punch, asshole.Was she supposed to hug you when you said this to her?!“When Damon ties you up again, show him what a scrapper you are. It’ll amuse him.”She has her priorities straight, tho. When Damon tells her he’s going to kill Kai in the church, she runs to save Kai but instead of leaving the church, they end up fucking there.And in case you’re still not convinced she’s two people“They’re probably checking to make sure I found you. We should stop.”“No.” I kissed her neck, feeling my orgasm coming as I groped her breast.“Ah,” she whimpered. “Go harder. Please.”Her issues were so built up but not really mentioned after the ✨magical sex scene ✨How does she just move on from“I wasn’t supposed to change,” I said quietly. “I wasn’t supposed to grow up.”When Kai asks why she’s waxedtonothing?? Am I the only one who found this creepy af?!In the end, tho, I knew she neededto go home toowhen Michael gave her some facts.God, she even has me praising Michael, what is going on right now??Look in the fucking mirror the next time you want to cast aspersions on her character. All you’ll see is your own self-hate and jealousy.✨Pro Tip✨Please see a therapist, please and thank you.The RomanceI’m tired of trashing these people so i’mma just focus on the things I liked here.“Do you feel that?” he whispered.“What?”His long arms blanketed mine, my hands resting inside his. “You fit me like a shirt. It’s a perfect mold.”I smiled to myself, feeling a blush of heat my face. “For now,” I said. “I’m done growing, but you’re probably not.”Men typically kept growing a little longer than women.His breath hit my ear. “Then we’re on borrowed time, aren’t we?”“This means nothing,” I mumbled, still snuggling into his body.His chest shook under my head. “Absolutely nothing. I promise.”Can I tell you something else?You’ll never leave this house.“Sometimes when everything and everyone around me is hard to face, I look up.”The steak scene, the shower scene, the dogs and cook scene (especially Kai’s reaction to the new arrivals), those really soothed some of my frustration. I loved them.I wanted to grow up.This and her scene with her mom broke my heart.Stuff (it’s 3 am and it shows)➩ My favorite character in this book is Will. I wish he’d gotten more dialogue.“What the hell would he want with her when we have top-shelf chicks in our cars right now? Didn’t you see how she was dressed? No make-up, guys’ clothes... She’s a feminist.”➩ The existence of Alex➩ I don't even have the energy to hate on Rika and Michael, justand➩ I tried counting how many times Damon is mentioned, I stopped a little north of 123456789.➩ All that build up around Damon showing up and that grand finale was lame af.✨Pro Tip✨If you want to convince me a book is not merely a set up for another character’s book, don’t make the epilogue about him, please and thank you. 😇Water cascaded down his face, making his black hair hang over his eyes, and I knew I couldn’t ever not love him. Bleeding, broken, lost, and alone, he was back up, wasn’t he? He would always be able to take whatever anyone did to him. Twist it. Turn it. Swallow it.Final ThoughtsA quote from the book perfectly expressed my feelings for it.”He doesn’t hate you,” I assured him, smiling to myself. “He’s waiting for the better you. That’s all.”
