1,5 🌟🏈Break - Minnesota Mavericks Book 01 by A. B. Marie💔 (available on Kindle Unlimited)My rec today might fit in the "rage read" category for some, seing that the MMC is the kind that is blind to the OW’s true nature and keeps neglecting everyone that he's supposed to love, care and prioritize for her.💫Light Spoilers:💫FMC and MMC grew up in trailer parks with neglectful parents and have always lean on each other. MMC's parents 💀 shortly after he won a sports scholarship in another town and left two little girls - his 8 years old twin sister's - on his care. So FMC left everything behind to go with him and help take care of the girls.They lived together for 8 years, while he was studying she was with his sisters. Once his hockey career took off, their life's got better and he even paid for FMC's college.Being two oblivious idiots, they've been pining for each other other since they were teenagers but think that the other will never want anything more than friendship.One night after a friend's engagement party, they had smex while drunk and he didn't remember anything after.About 1 month later, she discovered that she was pregnant on the same day when he went to the clinic where she works, introduced her to his new girlfriend and asked to make STDs tests, so he could have smex without c0ndoms with his girlfriend since she was allergic to latex.Before they - MMC and OW left -, he dropped the bomb that his girlfriend would be moving in with them. FMC sees this as a sign to keep the pregnancy for herself, since MMC always said that he didn't want childrens and was head deep his new relationship.After that their relationship goes downhill. She never came back home, stayed in a hotel for a few days, rented a house and move out of MMC's house without a word to him.The twins - MMC's sisters -, essentially moved in with her short after, since the OW is as nasty b!tch and openly show that she doesn't want them around.MMC kept prioritizing the OW - for the dumbest reasons -, gradually losing his friends, bff (FMC) and sisters respect and affection.💫Full Spoilers:💫He discovers FMC pregnancy through a Facebook post and is devastated bcs everyone is sharing this with her but not him.He begs her to see him, she relents and after that they start to mend they're friendship.MMC stays with OW until 70% of the book - more or less - and their break up is a sh!t show.After selling his house, he moves in with FMC and the twins, even accepting to sleep on the couch so he can be near them.One day after he's back from a game, FMC offers her bed for him to have some proper sleep and he asked her to come with him.Some massages and a proposal to help each other relieve some smexual tension, they do the did and he goes all cave man on her saying something along the lines that now that he had a taste, she'll be only his and won't ler her go.Shortly after this, FMC feels guilty about him not knowing that the babies are his so she tells him before they're born.He acts like the jerk he is, leaves home saying that he'll be back once he cools off and ghosted her for months.After the babies birth, he shows up in the hospital, gave her some lame excuses, said that he's doing therapy blah, blah... She accepts his excuses, everything is fine.They have their HEA.It was an entertaining rage read for me and despite the premise being interesting, I don't think it was well executed.✨As always, I'm open for similar recs if you have some to share.✨https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09L6HPWGD
