THIS REVIEW CONTAIN SPOILERS AND SAFETY INFO.Let’s start saying that I am NOT the target audiences of this book.I hate hate hate cheating and I don’t buy (normally) their HEA. I always thing that the cheater should have grovel way more and I am not sure that it’s not going to happen again, normally I think more that the cheated on is going to suffer less when it happens again because they are kinda numb. I don’t know if it makes sense. Long story short I don’t buy this romances.I wrote a review before reading it with info that I read from other reviews. So I knew what I was getting on and I obviously wasn’t 100% blind. I knew some major spoilers and so far I thought the book was not going to be of my liking but I decided to give it a try because of the reviews talking great things about it. The info it’s at the end. I will update it if something different happens that I thought it didn’t and I will add more info.Things that I wanted to found in this book.-Why he cheated? A good reason. If there ever any for doing it…-Major major major grovel.-Not celibate heroine. Being sexually satisfied.-Hero suffering from mistakes.-Hero kicking ow to the curb and putting h first.-That he doesn’t love the ow. Pretty please.-Her family putting her first. And kicking him.

But I hope it focus on the cheating and they don’t jump to bed like nothing.-She moving on with her life and being happy.-A hea that I can believe.-Be 100% sure that he is not going to stray again.As you guys can read. I was asking a lot. Did I get it?Let’s start with the first sentence of the book.Any man who tells you great head isn’t as good as sex, has never had great head. I love sex as much as any man, too much probably, all things considered. There is a certain power that comes with a blowjob, a feeling unlike anything else when a beautiful woman will debase herself, drop to her knees, staring up at you in worship, all while you choke her with your cock.Obviously this is the ow, Lorelei, giving him a bj. The scene continues like this…While it feels amazing, it’s not enough to stop the memories that tease my mind back to the first time I looked upon my wife and knew I loved her. The day I knew I would want her to be my wife, take my name, grow old beside me. We were so young then. I was just seventeen. She was two years younger; not old enough to drive a car, but she drove me crazy. June was always flitting around her house when I was hanging out there with Reed, her brother. He’s my best friend, brother more like. June would storm into the room and suck up all my attention, all my oxygen, with her thick mane of mahogany hair and angelic face, always buried in a book. A deep hum of pleasure makes my dick twitch and brings me back to the present. This happens often, nearly every time. My mind reminding me of all the reasons I fell in love with June, bombarding me with scenes while I fuck my way through them. I can’t ever seem to block them out, no matter how I try. Every push, I go deeper. She’s good at this. She can take it. I move my hand to tangle it in the hair at the back of her head and guide her farther down my shaft, nose pressed to my groin, and I hold. Just a few long seconds, just a few stolen breaths, before I pull her back and set a faster pace.At this point I’m like it’s impossible that he can be redeemed. Well, this is just the beginning.It all quiets as my abs constrict. Peace as I push the head back away from my cock and spill over the flushed cheeks and pretty, swollen lips. It’s a gorgeous sight, one much needed after the hard game I played tonight and the even harder hits I took. Something like drunken double vision takes over, though I’m completely sober. One eye seeing the sight in front of me, one seeing the innocence of my wife the first time I had her in this position. A few hard blinks wash the sight away. A soft tongue licks me clean, like it’s her job. I guess it kind of is; she knows what I like, how to please me after all this time together. Once she’s done, I run my hand down her head and cup her cheek. She stands and turns to walk into the bathroom. I watch with appreciation as her bare ass bounces away.So… no condoms.“Dollface, dinner is here,” I holler into the bathroom, its open door just to my right. “I’m coming. You got cum in my hair, babe. That takes a minute to get out,” she responds. I give a little laugh. I know she hates that shit. “Sorry, next round, I’ll save it all for that tight ass of yours. I know that’s your favorite and I neglected it last time.” She walks out and wraps her lithe nakedness around me, then shoves her hand in my boxers, waking my dick back up. “Mmm, yes, you did.” She pouts. It’s the soft whimpering gasp that stops her hand. A gasp that sounds as loud as a bullet ricocheting several times off metal walls. Right before it lodges in your heart. A gasp that turns my blood cold. I know that sound. I’ve heard it before. It’s the sound my wife makes when she’s scared or hurt. The same sound she made two years ago when we received the call that her dad had perished in an auto accident. The sound she made just over five years ago when she woke up in a hospital bed, terrified, after being attacked by a man who had stalked her relentlessly. It’s the sound that marks every horrific experience of June’s life. The sound she made each time I had to wake her from her nightmares, for months. A sound that would have me rushing to her side, sliding my arms around her. Promising her everything will be okay and that I’ll be by her side as we get her through whatever the problem is.Yes… I-I don’t even know where to start. He sleeps with ow without protection. Later on he explains that he was careful because he made this ow and others sign and NDA or some kinda of document to make sure they didn’t say anything and with this one she sign that she was on the pill and is not sleeping with others. Rolls eyes. Well, spoiler: she DOESNT GET PREGNANT. Thank God because our h maybe it’s not able to have kids. I will go through that in a moment. Later, he get tested realizing he wasn't that careful. And talked about it with h.So, she founds him and leave. He follows after her but she catch a taxi before. The paparazzi (obv) take photos of this. The returns to his room and don’t follow her that day because his team leaves the next day. AND the ow spends the night there. They didn’t sleep together but we don’t know why she stayed and what they talked about. What we do know it’s that this stupid guy follows ow the next morning to make sure she catches a taxi and they look at each other and he kissed her forehead. The paparazzis took photos of that too. Where is the heroine? In their home with her brother and his bff packing a bag to leave the next day. He came and for one moment she is kinda numb and is about to give him a bj. And I was like wtf? And she said something like is this what she does for you? The heroine is pretty numb as I said and doesn’t go bitchy until later on (I love that part) she always is worrying about others and about this asshole H and later on she stopped that. So, he stopped her when she is doing something sexually.So, she remove her ring (his mother’s) and he freak out. She goes to a hotel and they start to go to therapy and to some dates. They kinda has to face some public opinions and issues. He explains that he cheated on her with 4 women. We don’t know exactly when. The first one was a bj that we know (don’t know if something more) he felt very guilty and thought he was going to be caught. All this women were found in a sex club. We don’t know if he used protection with the 3 others. The second one was one that look similar to h some months after. Then the third one was one that didn’t look like h at all and he come any way. And the fourth was Lorelei. They knew each other in college. She was a cheerleader and he was a QB. They slept together and she told him her traumatic childhood. Then she told him that her bf and her had rough sex and he hurt her. This is an important part of the story. This bf is OM, Noah. So after that H thought he was a knight in shiny armor and protect her. And started to have a rivalry with Noah, another player.Fast forward they found each other a year before h found the affair and they start an affair. No strings. Even tho he was married. They didn’t love each other but obviously he cared for her. Turns out that Ow was the one that proposed to Noah the kinky sex and he didn’t want to do it because he didn’t know how. She went to a party with H to make him jealous and after that he said yes and because he didn’t know how to do it he hurt her and felt awful about it. She told another story to H. All this happened in college. H is now 29.H has been in love with h since he was 17 and she was 15. Didn’t say or show almost anything having always women in his arms until an stalker attacked her and she almost died. She was 22. He was 24. So 7 years of “pinning”Let’s go to the attack. She had an stalker that followed her and wanted her but she didn’t want anything. She is a virgin and is waiting for H. So, one day she is attack by him with a knife and he cut her clothes and masturbate and he left her some scars. They found them before something more happened but before leaving he cut her stomach and because of that she may not be able to have kids and it’s more likely she would have miscarriages. She woke up in the hospital and H asked her to marry him. Weeks later they married.In five years, she was attack. Maybe lose the opportunity to have kids. Have scars in her body and nightmares. 3 years later her dad died in a car accident. A year later her husband starts an affair with ow but has been with others before. So, while she was grieving her dad he was unfaithful. A dad that was a parent figure for him and try to teach him to be honorable and all that. Then the affair goes public and she knows about it. Also, she stopped her career because his was very demanding. SHE HAS GONE THROUGH SO SO SO MUCH. I just want her to be happy.So, she moves out and starts a job in another state. And she is working with Noah (OM and ex of Lorelei) obv H is not thrilled by this and saw photos of them having dinner together. Get angry and called her. After not contacting with her for days because it’s trying to give her space and to grow (but doesn’t explain to her just did it)Well, the review is way too long now so long story short, she did some kissing and come for OM after being friend with him and throw herself at him. He denied her but did some stuff. I found great pleasure when H founds she wanted to be f by OM but he denied. So, after talking with therapist and all that, he is doing better. We don’t know exactly because there are not many chapter from his pov. I wish there were more. Especially since the first one is so horrible. He realize OM is a great guy and when h tells him she had a fantasy in which she suck om while H fucks her, he decide to do a threesome (kinda). The OM only comes on her tits while she masturbate him and H fucks her. He also do some oral stuff to h and H and pretty much that’s it.It’s not a hea. There are still going to therapy and they are working to do better. She sometimes get sad from this but wants to move on. I wish her mom was a little more rough with H and also we don’t really have a resolution with H and h’s brother. I think there is going to be a book about him and h’s bff. Also, I wanted more resolution with ow but again I think it’s going to be a book about OM and ow.So far I thought I was going to cry more and hate more the H. I hate him but I kinda believe he is not going to cheats again.The only thing that idk it’s that what would have happened if heroine doesn’t like that kinky sex. If would have been normal after her traumatic events and he should have love her and being loyal to her instead of search for his own needs. The reason why he did what he did it’s he could and he was selfish and didn’t have to work for h or for their marriage. They didn’t date before getting married. He knew he had her.I forgot to add that he apologize publicly. Kinda. He was doing a football interview and they talked about how he tend to compartmentalize and that that doesn’t help in the game. The rest of the team were having great things happening in their life and that made them play better. He said he was going to be a better QB being a better man and better husband. Also, he said his wife was there and prob giving him a last chance that he didn’t deserves. We don’t know about the things publicly that went down with ow. We know he talked with her after they have been caught because she told him she stopped working in her job because her boss try to have sex with her thinking she was easy. Also, the H is so stupid that after ow calls him relentlessly he answers and told him to stop calling because he wants his wife back and wants to bring her back home. She is in a hotel. Dumbass said the hotel and ow went to talked with h.Lastly, there is a final confrontation, I wish H was the one to kick her ass but h was the one standing for herself. Here’s the extract.“What the fuck are you thinking?” “You wouldn’t answer my calls. What was I supposed to do, Drew?” “You were supposed to fuck all the way off. I’m sure I’ve told you this already,” I say when I step up next to my, clearly irate, husband. “I’m not here to talk to you, June.” Her spine straightens as she tries to compose herself. “Oh, honey, I don’t care what your intentions are. You need to leave.” “Lorelai, go,” Drew drawls through terse lips. “Not until you let me explain. Please?” “Nobody wants to hear it. Leave.” Her eyes flash back to me, changing instantly from the sad, pleading ones she used to look at Drew, to white hot rage for me. “Fuck you, June,” she yells, inches from my face. Drew tries to step between us, but my hand automatically pushes him back. This is my fight. And I want it. Badly. “You have everything. Everything! You don’t even deserve it.” She laughs as I stare her down. It’s tinged with hysteria and mockery. It’s the latter that makes me seethe. It’s the direction I know her thoughts are going that makes my fists clench with anger, with all my past pent-up insecurities. I’m ready when she says it. “He’s only with you because he feels sorry for you,” she spits. I swing.H’s reply…“That was so fucking hot, Junie. I’m going to make you come harder than you’ve ever come in your life, tonight.” “You fucking better.” I laugh, letting some of the awkward tension rinse away. “And tomorrow morning, before the game, I want you to take me to see our house.”Let’s continue with their backstory. He is brother’s bff so he knows her for kinda all their live. What do he do? Sleep with ow during HS and college until he decide he wants heroine. 🙃 bro, this Hero is a Zero. I want her to find happiness after everything that she’s been going through but girl let yourself a favor. So, I think at the beginning of the book we discover the cheating. She finds him in a hotel with ow. The talked about it and he says that this has been going through for a year. She removes her rings and he panicked. Bro it’s more important the fking ring that the well being physically and mentally of your wife? Well he didn’t care that much because after this he went to ow to spend the night. Being an asshole and stupid because he is famous and paparazzi caught him kissing ow before accompanying her to a taxi. Also he defends ow instead of wife or something like that. He puts ow before wife. Also I don’t know if they sleep together before h and H get together. But she is someone who is in their life and has been for years. He believes some story that she told him and after being proved is false he doesn’t 100% believe it a first.He goes to therapy to try to know why he did what he did and why he didn’t communicate with h.She moves to another state and continues her career that was on pause because of him. Another thing that I hate about this type of thing is that she was “humiliated” on public. Now everyone will know he is a cheater and honestly I feel like the one being humiliated and being show as a dick is him but I will find more difficult to forgive if the whole world knew about my shitty cheating husband and this ow.She kinda sleeps with OM. There is a OM that is his enemy because a exgf/ mistress talked bad about OM and H believed it. And some reviews says that OM made her feel beautiful and sexy and discover her sexual kinky needs. Hope that means they have hot dirty sex. I’m that petty. It would serve him right. He didn’t communicate with his wife his needs and desires and search for them elsewhere. Now she has found them for the first time with this amazing OM. Kinda wish she would kick him in his ass and leave with OM.UPDATE: WE HAVE INFO ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE NIGHT AFTER h FOUND THEM:“He stayed with you that night after June found you two together.” “No, not really. I had my own room. When he came back from chasing June, I helped him make phone calls to try to get an earlier flight back. His coach fought him on it. By the time he convinced him, there weren’t any flights left. The more options that failed, the more unsettled he got. Until eventually he shut down. He stopped talking, wouldn’t respond to anything I said. Then he locked himself in the bathroom and screamed like he was dying. I didn’t know what to do. I curled up in a chair, and fell asleep waiting for him to come out,” I say, swallowing down the emotion clogging my throat. I’d never felt anyone’s anguish like that before. I can’t imagine I’ll ever forget it. “I was worried. I’d never seen anyone so distraught. Hours later when I woke up, he was still in there. Talking to himself like she was locked in there with him. It was the saddest thing I’d ever heard. I was ashamed that I was there to bear witness to it.” “You shouldn’t have. That wasn’t for you.” “I know, Noah,” I say, my heated voice now matching his. “But he was the only friend I had, and I couldn’t just leave him like that.” “Friends who fuck.”H never said ow name, oral, never stay the night, never kissed her, thought about h and said h name...
