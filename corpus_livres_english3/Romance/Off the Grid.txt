✩‧₊2 stars★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆⋆｡ﾟ☁︎｡⋆｡ ﾟ☾ ﾟ｡⋆Off The Grid⋆｡ﾟ☁︎｡⋆｡ ﾟ☾ ﾟ｡⋆Spencer Riggs (h) hasn't gotten his opportunity to get a seat in F1, but he knows his time is coming. When he gets the call, he knows he can't mess his opportunity up because he worked really hard to get there. The bad thing is that his boss's daughter is Camila Moretti (h), the girl he kissed on a dare, and she has the opportunity to threaten it all.⋆┈┈┈┈*⛧♡﹤୨THOUGHTS♡୧﹥ ┈┈*⛧⋆"The card was . . . real—at first—but then I ran into you and—"""And saw a woman least likely to be hit on. Way to boost your ego while hurting mine. Class fucking act."""I know. And that says so much more about you than it ever could say about me.""Riggs was a total asshole from the start.He approached her at the bar because he thought she was a woman who wouldn't get flirted with at the bar, and to make it worse, he criticized her attire; then he felt like an asshole in the future when he discovered why she dressed that way. He shouldn't have made fun of her in the first place, it's not his place to dictate how a woman should dress. If it's not flattering for him, he should continue with his business. I also didn't like that Camila insisted that he tell her why she was not appealing to him. Then, he told her, and she was upset.I don't think these two had chemistry; it was an unnecessary drama that wanted to appease the enemies in the lovers' plot line, but they had no connection.It was bad. He only regretted his actions because she was a Moretti and realized she could fuck him over and his opportunity in F1. I don't support Riggs and he took feedback as a personal attack."I had to. I was doing my job."""A marketing manager giving a driver a warning? Berating him in front of the entire fucking crew? Last I checked, that wasn't in your job description.""Cat got your tongue, Moretti?""Camila needed to act more professionally, especially when she wanted respect from the crew. Her dad was right; she is obligated to reprimand her client when he doesn't do a good job. It's her job to focus on his image, and it looks bad when a driver does not listen to his engineers or his team because it's a group effort. He could have acted a fool in F2, but he couldn't decide the strategy for himself in F1.It's a shame that he thought the world revolved around him because it doesn't. He took the criticism to the ass and would throw a little tantrum.The girl had my dream job and was about to ruin it all for a man who wasn't worth it. Riggs is a classified asshole and does not appreciate Cami, he only notices her or likes her when she changes up her appearance, and she met his standards of ideal beauty. I don't know how people think he's likable on social media; he's just a jerk. He thought it was funny to make a post about how he was sleeping with the boss's daughter when they weren't yet. That only got her in trouble, and that could have ruined her reputation. Of course, he didn't think about that; Riggs only thinks about himself. 🙄🙄🙄 To be fair, I knew he couldn't be trusted when he said she was the least likely to be hit on and didn't know she had a history of SA."I made fun of your clothes." His words startle me.""You didn't know," I murmur and mean it.""I know, but what a shallow prick. I made fun of you because you were covered up like you owed it to me and everyone else to show your body.""I don't like how the SA was discussed in the book or handled.It was assumed that Camila had undergone a traumatic event because she wore baggy clothes and wasn't comfortable dressing in a way that showed her body. She also gave up life in the Paddock even though she used to love the place, but somehow, no one cares enough to ask what happened. Did no one realize that she changed overnight? Did no one find it suspicious that she would get pale when she saw a specific person at the Paddock? I'm in disbelief that the SA was discussed in the near-final chapter, and all that happened was Riggs punched the man in the face, which threatened his career in F1 because he already had two strikes. To make it worse, he made it about himself and said he didn't regret his actions, but he needed space because he was about to lose his entire career.It's a mess, and this isn't romance.I think there could have been a better way to discuss SA and Formula 1, but this was the route I anticipated the book to take."No. Listen to me. Please," she pleads, suddenly flustered and desperate for me to understand. "It's me. I'm broken. That's why . . . that's why I asked you tonight. For this. For sex.""Broken? I don't. . . talk to me. Why would you say that? Everything . . ."I hate that she expressed that she was broken, and his first reaction was to fix the problem with sex.TALK WITH HER. LISTEN TO HER.It's also unrealistic to think that after years of not being able to orgasm because of the sexual trauma of the assault, his going down on her fixed it in ONE CHAPTER. Even so, it should have taken various times till she felt comfortable. I just wanted the conversation to be different. It's slightly strange that the topic of SA was rushed and disregarded just to prove that their connection got rid of all the trauma; that's not how it works. I hated this. I'm disappointed with the execution and how it all felt like a ploy to make it seem like a person who is good at sex can fix all your problems. Her trauma was still there. It happened. Did he even talk to her about it? No his response was anger. He punched Brandon made a scene, and left her no choice but to tell her story.She had a right to tell her family and friends on her own terms.Instead, she felt obligated to come forward to protect Rigg's F1 spot. It's a shame.How are they in love? When did they fall in love? Was it when he was insulting her fashion sense?Was it when she would instigate a fight for no reason for the sake of hating him? She couldn't move on from the bet card. She kept instigating situations, and he would be honest, then she would want to cry about it. It was a major headache. There is nothing likable about this couple. The crazy part is he cannot pinpoint a moment when he KNEW he loved her. He said it could have been when they kissed at the bar on the first night. How can that be? He was too busy telling her that she was unlikable!!!! He didn't find her appealing because he said her lack of confidence was a turn-off. He is a liar!!! Why did they get engaged ONE YEAR LATER???? I'm calling for a divorce in their future."I fucking finished on the podium, and it wasn't because I did what was right, so what makes you think it's right or wrong when it comes to being with you?"From an F1 standpoint, there is no way this man got his first podium in his rookie year.Does he think he's Oscar Piastri? He's not! He didn't listen, believed he could do whatever he wanted, and overtook his teammate. He's not a team player and he should have been demoted to F2 again. I LOVE F1, AND I HATED THIS BOOK. It was bad. I could imagine the tracks, which made it somewhat interesting, but the romance was 😵‍💫 NOT GOOD. Spencer Riggs is the worst, and Camila just needed to do her job and call it a day. Her dad should have fired her because she was too busy focusing on Riggs and not the other driver. FOLLOW PROTOCOL. The drivers don't go around doing what they want — well, Max does sometimes. However, this man was ignoring instructions left and right. He's terrible.˚ ༘♡ ⋆｡ ❀OVERALL˚ ༘♡ ⋆˚ ❀The book was a snooze fest😴💤 and Riggs, and Camila had terrible banter and chemistry. I don't like this relationship and will likely not pick up a book by the author again if this is the writing style. The dialogue was not great, and it felt forced. I'm just not happy with what I've read.
