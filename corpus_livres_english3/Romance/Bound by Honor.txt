5 stars. Rereading Cora's books brings too much joy back into my life.Love that for me. 💀💀💀This one is so funny and wholesome. I'm actually rolling on the floor reminiscing (as I write this review) about the super melodramatic scene where Aria and Luca stare into each other's eyes, Aria standing in the doorway of some faceless apartment, Luca perched on the bed with his gun resting peacefully at an arm's length while his cock is buried deep inside some whore's pussy.Luca's face:3 seconds of deafening silence as Luca and Aria just kept staring at one another is still ringing so loudly in my ears, it's almost scary. The image is embedded in my head and so vivid that I can't help wondering why it sends me straight into the orbit of Mars whenever I randomly remember about it?MY FAVORITE BITS AND PIECESJust to get some things out of the way: the plot revolves around two mafia bands that decide to forge an alliance by marrying off their leaders' offsprings:Aria Scuderi (h), the daughter of theOutfit's consigliere, andLuca Vitiello (H), a future capo of theFamiglia.FAMILY AND RELATIONSHIP DYNAMICS✂Books about trophy wives always turn out to be so endearing to me because their heroines are literally livingmydream. 🌝If the mere idea of playing dumb socialite by day and kitten by night while being pampered like a princess by a sugar daddy 24/7 soundsrepulsiveworse when compared to working9 to 5I havebad news for you: capitalism fucked with your headnothing to tell you butreconsider your lifethat most likely this couple's dynamics won't excite you much.Sometimes I do wonder what my future mafia sugar daddy (fairly young, stunningly beautiful, sinfully rich and obscenely powerful 💅🏻) is up to? WHERE THE FUCK IS THE HOE BASTARD CRASHING WHEN HE'S IS SUPPOSED TO BE SPOILING ME ROTTEN RIGHT ABOUT NOW?On a serious note, I'm just kidding, y'all. 😔 I'm an independent woman that doesn't stand by the concept of having to rely on anyone economicallysugar daddy come rescue me from this capitalistic hell. 😔✂sisterly and brotherly bonds in this series make me regret I have no siblings. Aria&Gianna and Luca&Matteo dynamics are woven so magically. You can feel how close they are: they'd bleed, kill and die for each other. 🥺🥺🥺NOT ME TRYING TO FEEL THE VOID OF BEING A SINGLE CHILD WITH CORA REILLY'S MAFIA BOOKS. SJSJSJSJSJSJ. 🤡 That bitch Cora really hyped up the institute of sisterhood and brotherhood for me. Apparently I've been robbed by my own parents. 👺✂Aria's sister is my spirit animal. Her getting on Luca's last nerve during her short visit to New York had me dying from laughter. Gianna took a metaphorical cross-cut saw and dedicated her time to sawing Luca's brain in half with precision and skill unmatched: plucking out sore spots, rubbing salt into the wounds, spitting facts only. 💅🏻😌 For some reason, characters that have the tough exterior yet the softest heart tug at my heartstrings. I loved that messy bitch. 😌I wish I had a sister like Gianna or Aria, their interactions were unbearably cute and filled with fierce sister energy. Not them already missing each other after only a couple of days spent apart. 😂🥺I felt a sort of pity for their youngest sissy Lilliana, though. She was treated like a spare tyre — stuffed in the backseat, annoying the shit out of everyone by just existing.Illustration of Aria, Gianna and Lilliana's relationship:✂When she is the tightest hole he has ever fucked, a reader knows that they're in for a ride where the main characters wind up being stuck together forever in their never-ending HEA: that is pretty much Aria and Luca's relationship put in a nutshell.:D✂I'm weirdly fascinated by the scenes where a heroine is high/drunk as fuck and a hero saves her from a creepy guy and takes care of her afterwards. All the better when alcohol/drugs (💀💀) loosen her tongue making her proclaim her otherwise secret infatuation out in the open. YES, BITCH, DROP THE L-BOMB ON HIM and let him deal with the consequences. 💅🏻✂Luca acting super tender but also horny and impatient as fuck all the time. 🤌🏻✂I appreciated that Aria both set boundaries and adapted to her situation.The reason as to why I prefer shy and reserved female characters to popular nowadays "badass" heroines at any time of the day is mostly due to how the latter are being written.Whenever I stumble upon a main female character of some mafia bookboss around people thrice her age and experience, flip off her 'dark, dangerous' mafia ass husband she met a few days ago and magically get away with demonstrating childish acts of defiance in front of big bad guys with nothing to/on her but a big mouth, I get really pissed. Immature, unreasonable,dumbbehavior and inability to read the table that get no comeuppance whatsoever thanks to aplot armorshouldn't be confused with acting like a "badass". It's tantamount to congratulating someone on their courage after they poked a tiger in the ribs and remained unscathed because the tiger had been shot with a tranquilizer a few minutes prior.I really like heroines who know how to pick their battles. Aria comes to terms with the inevitable, trying to make the most of the situation where she holds no power, and seizes an opportunity to fight for something that truly matters to her.I like them smart, not "badass".THE WRITING✂When it comes to anything but romance, Cora's books make no sense, and it's so fun to watch how she just keeps it rolling with innocent lack of self-awareness. Iconic. 😌So just watch in incredulous fascinationpampered mafia princess Aria shoot a Russian gangster in the head, not missing a shot on her first try ever, only to catch a stray bullet in her SHOULDER (🤣) from a seasoned mafia man (🤣🤣) in return (🤣🤣🤣), and don't ask questions.You can see the twisted beauty of Cora's logic here, don't you? 😌✂Some endearing absurdity issues aside, Cora knows how to create the credible atmosphere despite the fact that her writing is straightforward and not very inventive: she certainly doesn't beat around the bush nor does she aspire to receive the best purple prose award. Yet, her writing style creates images in your head even without her going into much detail. The flow of her texts is smooth: she doesn't overexplain nor does she force you to trudge through voluminous and repetitive inner monologues, leaving some things to your imagination. Which is really welcome, for some readers don't like to be spoon fed with information.I sincerely don't understand why so many reviewers shit on Cora's writing style so much (maybe it's an unspoken rule that people follow because it makes them feel better about reading and secretly enjoying trash sjsjsj) when it's, in fact, so ADDICTIVE. Let's be real, her writing is nowhere near Steinbeck or Shakespeare's level of mastery, but who would even expect that from a mafia romance author? 💀 Cora's command of the language is decent. For what it's worth:DSome romance authors do indeed write way more eloquently and inventively, managing to dish out sensible plots and credible characters, yet most of them waffle too much plunging their readers into a deep slumber. <3 And then there's Cora that writes trashy content that people consistently look down on but whenever a new release comes out, they're the first one to jump on the bandwagon. 🤡 CUTE.The argument that she's popular because her work is easy to consume is so funny to me, too. As if 100% of books in the romance genre are NOT easy to consume and digest.You know you're a very gifted writer when they read youdespiteand notbecause.😌LUCA'S CHEATING✂I'm gonna say something very controversial now, but I think thatcheating in this book made ALL THE SENSE IN THE WORLD.🌝 It fit Luca's character perfectly.If you're a reader who only cares about tropes and safety, you'll definitely hate that scene regardless.I, for one, loveviewing things in the context. Yeah, everyone knows cheating is bad (since monogamy is still one of the core values for many societies), but it's fiction and there's no point in explaining the obvious downside of being a cheating piece of shit to a fictional character. I think it's valid to judge questionable behavior not by an act committed in itself, but by how well it chimes in with a character's arc and whether it moves the story forward, adding anything to the plot and romantic relationship between the main characters.My takeaway from Luca's cheating:1) the scene was very important in terms of showing Luca's character development and the shift in his priorities. When Luca is forced to search frantically for runaway Aria, in throes of cultural shock after seeing him "in action" with OW (sjsjs), he pulls his head outta his ass and comes to the realization that he can can actually lose his wife for good. He got the message: whoring around is no future modus operandi for him.2) Luca immediately agrees to not fuck anyone but Aria when that very night she confronts him about his cheating and explains her feelings about it.The power of communication. 🤌🏻3) their conversation shed light on how most couples in the mafia operate.As in, it didn't even occur to Luca that Aria would mind him fucking around on her. Most marriages in the Famiglia are arranged between the families and normally none of the spouses harbors any warm feelings for another: most wives welcome the fact that their husbands find a sidepiece and leave them alone (they can't return the favor by doing the same because, apparently, Italian mafia societies are traditional and misogynistic).Taking into account that Aria refused to sleep with him, Luca assumed, as someone who had never had an example of a normal functioning relationship in front of his eyes, that she despises him and would be fine with that type arrangement.So even if the foreign concept of "getting to know each other before jumping into bed" didn't ring a bell to him, he still didn't mind exploring it with Aria. Once he learned what she expected and wanted from their marriage, he had no problem ditching his fuck buddy. Which says a lot about his character: namely, that he wanted to make their marriage work and was willing to make an effortand not fuck anything in skirt sjsjsj.I'm so confused by the sheer number of readers who apply standards of your normal, consensual real-life romantic relationships to Cora's mafia books when it's clear they have zero relevance to how arranged marriages in her work. 💀💀Some of you expect thisarranged mafia couple, with no love lost between them, to have a perfectly sweet, normal and healthy relationship ignoring the fact that the whole concept of arranged marriages is basically the opposite of that. These characters don't have the privilege of choosing their partner willingly like most of us do. They operate under different laws so trying to fit them into a pink box of hearts and flowers is weird as hell of you. Seeing things through different lens is fun, some people should really try it one day. 😌😌😌I'm not even saying all of that to justify Luca being a sexist pig and a whore. I'm just saying that the cheating scene makes sense in the context of Luca's character, the values instilled in him from birth, his upbringing and the world he (not me or you) lives in.More so, the cheating scene became a milestone in AriaLuca relationship, egging on a significant shift in their dynamics. It wasn't introduced mindlessly to scandalize a bunch of pearl-clutchers. Whether you like cheating or not in romance books is a matter of your personal preference that bears no relevance to the book. 😂As you can see,I LOVED EVERY SINGLE MOMENT I SPENT READING THIS BOOK FOR THE THIRD TIME. 🤡🤡🤡 BYE —
