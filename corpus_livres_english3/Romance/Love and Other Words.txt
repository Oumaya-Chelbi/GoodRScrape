(i’m petty betty, i know)— yeah, that’s LaOW for me.𝗦𝗨𝗠𝗠𝗔𝗥𝗬༄⁂This warm love story begins withMacey’s (h)dad getting a summer house that’s neighbored besideElliot’s (H)and from there they both form a heartfelt friendship and a profound bond through books and words. Over the years during weekends spending inside a closet, their sacred haven, one day an irreversible tragedy causes Macey to disappear on Elliot and leave him and their relationship at lost for 11 years.Suddenly, fate leads them back to each other to restore their faith in their love and Macey is finally forced to confront the past and give closure to Elliot’s decade of agony.*The book is told in alternating time lines betweenthenandnow.꧁𝗧𝗛𝗢𝗨𝗚𝗛𝗧𝗦꧂I’m gonna give you guys my shitty summarized thoughts bc yall already know how ifeelabout this book and plus, i don’t want to give away too much so you guys can just enjoy the cute, emotional ride.Words can never explain how much i cherish the characters in this book and adore and desire the relationship that Elliot and Macey have. The bond they've created together is so deep, genuine, innocent and all-consuming that i'm always in awe whenever i do a reread. At this point, no one can understand how desperate i am to have what they have✊🏻😞❥Elliotwas, is and will forever be my top-tier fictionalhusband. periodt.Attentive, loving, caring, emotionally intelligent, and a hot nerd?

And that’s some sad shit, man❥Macey’sa sweetheart through and through. The deep loss she endured as a child breaks my heart and i’m so glad that Elliot is her Godsend.

Don't come for them too bc I’m always ready to protecc and attacc for them*Look, read it or don’t read it, thats up to you. I’m just here to leave a review for the softest romance book to ever exist in my petty life 🥺 ♥️*———xxx———xxx———⚠️SPOILERS⚠️*for real, don’t cross this section if you haven’t read this and are interested to pick this up someday bc this section willdiscuss the last 15% which involves the ‘reveal’ of the book.As you can see at the top of this review, i originally rated this4.75 starsbecause like others, i was unsatisfied with how the book ended. it felt rushed and too convenient. I’ve seen some reviews saying that Macey shouldn’t have forgiven him but honestly, all i felt was that Elliot should’ve been given more time to digest the reason why she left him all those years ago. Bc like it or not,technicallyhe did a play a factor to why Macy’s dad got into an accident and died. But i get it, it’s notentirelyhis fault.I totally 💯% understand why Macey left him with a long-decade of silence bc by the time she realized that he deserves a chance to explain himself and that the supposedly ‘cheating’ thing was small compared to the accident, she didn’t know how to reach out to him and was afraid to face the past that wounded her deeply."I wasn’t thinking clearly—after—I wasn’t able to separate—you. And it."Ok now, did Elliot reallycheaton her?I guess that depends on ones perspective of the situation.Personally, i don’t think so bc he was shitface drunk with disappointment that Macey didn’t give an assuring response to his proposal and didn’t say she loved him back. He already explained that he thought that Emma was her when he slept with Emma (sounds shitty, i know but if you reaLLYknowElliot and where his mind and heart is solely at, you’d believe him too bc he. would.never.my KING? cheating?! nu'uh, never!' "I was so drunk, Mace. I remember touching your hair, talking to you, encouraging. And when I look back, I still see your face when she climbed on me."....I remembered what Brandon started to say, something about how Elliotwouldn’t. 'EDIT❗️:A wonderful friend of mine here on GR,Juliahave pointed out something really important on this 'cheating' matter and i feel like it's important for others to understand this and see the logic from this perspective because Elliotdid notcheat. Instead,he was taken advantage of by Emma when he was vulnerable and not sober. Can you imagine if roles were reversed and it was Macey who was in his position? Do you think it'd be fair to say that she cheated on Elliot? Would you say she 'cheated' if she were so drunk and got approached by a guy who manipulated her into thinking that he's her boyfriend, then proceeded to take full advantage of her?Think about it. Just bc Eliot's a dude doesn't mean he's any less of a victim in this situation.Anyway~On my2nd reread, i read the book following itstimeline chronologically; starting with all the ‘Then’ chapters first and then moved to the ‘Now’ chapters. Ergo the5+ stars.Rereading it this way really helped me to understand why Christina Lauren wrote the ‘reveal’ scene and left the ending the way that they did. I was able to feel the 11 years of lost time and detachment when they bumped into each other at the cafe— The decade of silence suddenly became deafening, the buried disappointments and sadness immediately felt heavier. Only then was I able to understand more on how Elliot was able move on from the past without holding any grudges against Macey for the lost time and welcomed her back into his life with opened arms.It also helped me to separate the overload cuteness from the ‘Then’ chapters and the ‘Now’ chapters which are more focused on regrets and longing for one another.So i'd highly recommend any of you torereadthis following its timeline chronologically, if you ever plan to*****************************EDIT(24/12)since i’m tooyoung, dumb and broke~to treat myself on my birthday 🤠 i knowonething that can leave me beaming and heart swelling for the entire freaking day—rereading myultimatefave book of ALL. TIME.
