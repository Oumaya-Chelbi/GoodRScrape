I had mixed feelings going into this one. I was excited for Salem because she seemed totally kickass in Cypher’s book (I read them out of order), but Riggs was described as a MEGA manwhore in the first book, and I wasn’t sure how that would shake out.BUTI LOVE crazy OW club girl drama, and Riggsy’s main squeeze Baby Doll sounded like a psycho, and I was all up for that!Salem and Riggs have an instant lust at first sight attraction, but they have a rough start. Mostly because Salem doesn’t really take any shit. She’s also not looking for a relationship and is good with hookups, but she won’t be disrespected. And I LOVED that about her. Riggs is really confused in the beginning because he wants Salem so badly, but it takes him a minute to realize what he feels is different, so he screws things up a bit, and with some misunderstandings, they take a while to get it together.Bottom Line- Riggs was probably the worst in terms of getting his shit together, but IMO Salem is the best h of the series. She’s tough, she demands respect, she isn’t afraid to push back and walk away. But she also wasn’t too proud to be vulnerable when Riggs put it all out there so they could be together. Basically, if safety is a concern this one will probably piss you off the most, but I found it the most enjoyable.Safety-The first time they meet he’s making out with Dolly, but then hits on Salem and says she’s not his gf “I don’t do that dating shit. Dolly just likes my dick.” (Salem passes) Later she throws it back at him with her male BFF Spike who he’s jelly of that she used to sex with but now they’re just friends- “What can I say? Spike just likes my pussy” 🤣🤣. After that we’re told he’s slept with Dolly but it’s all off page. Later an hour before he’s supposed to pick Salem up for their first hookup, he tries to squeeze a hookup with Dolly in, but he can’t get it up, feels guilty, and stops her before she starts, BUT Salem catches him leaving the room followed by a half-naked Dolly. At this point, they were meeting for a no strings hookup, so I didn’t consider it cheating, but loved that Salem shut it down because he disrespected her. She deserved to be treated better than a club girl and demanded it.
