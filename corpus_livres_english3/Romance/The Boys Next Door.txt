Actual rating:2.5 out of 5 starsThis is far the most lascivious book I read and it surprised me in all levels unimaginable. Reading the synopsis which I thought very simple and innocent, was actually a long and painful thing to read.The intensity of the story was actually quite good but it was all sex and I'm looking for a little story, a drama that could give me a punch to make more senses to what was going on with the twins playing“the good twin”and“the bad twin”.I like the first few chapters where the author introduced her characters to her readers. I know it was where the getting to know part should started but as I went on, I knew there's missing elements which I always looked for in every genre I read.I have waited for events that could make the foundation of the story more interesting but when all of that happened, the right for me to know more about the characters got snatched too soon, the same way how it was replaced by the explicity of all the scenes that went after. I was looking for an actual conversation which I felt very limited to Diana's screams ofaaaaah'sand‘yes'.Every chapter was like a razor—sharper, intense and engaging all at the same time which got me frustrated because honestly, I'm rooting for Ian and I could state the obvious. While I liked how the story ended, I wish the threesome hotness stopped sooner rather than later.I love how the author was able to write in a very vivid narrative.A sketch that was too detailed but an abstract painting of colors splashed into a black canvas—my only way to describe the story as a whole.I don't exactly loved it but I don't hate it either. Maybe it was just too much for me to absorb.***I received a copy of this book in exchange for a fair and honest review!Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Pinterest
