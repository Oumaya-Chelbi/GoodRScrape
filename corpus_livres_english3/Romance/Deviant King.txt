“Do you know that I feel murderous when someone touches you? Is that why you pulled that fucking stunt?”⚠️⚠️⚠️Before I even get into this I just want to warn you this is a dark bully romance so please read the trigger warnings and not for everyone at some pointsI thought it wasn’t for me it still isn’t for meBUT I BOUGHT THE FULL SERIES IN HARDBACKS BECAUSE THE COVER WAS PRETTY SO WATERSTONES I HOPE YOUR MAKING GOOD USE OF MY MONEY BECAUSE IT DEFINITELY DENTED MY BANK ACCOUNT😂💀The story hits off immediately with Elsa who’s living with her aunt and uncle because both her parents died in a fire. It’s her first day at royal elite which as youv guessed it is a private school for the insanely rich upper class. Elsa immediately becomes friends with Kim the outcast who shows her around when they stop to watch the football team she’s met with these chilling black eyes before she gets a chance to ask who that boy was Kim pulls her away telling her that that’s Aiden king the most powerful and popular guy in school but she isn’t fast enough as Aiden slams her against the wall hand on her throat with the words“I will destroy you ”which seals her fate like bro your 16 chillNow did I love this or hate it I can’t really say im leaning more towards hate… the bullying isn’t why I rated this 3 stars as that was clearly part of the trigger warnings and it’s my fault for reading it it’s the fact that I can’t really make out the plot like yess there’s something that happened in Elsa's past that we don’t know of and the accident that caused her to lose her memories but there isn’t much about it just a few flashbacks and nightmares. I feel like we just kept going back to the same point in this book which was the constant fighting between Aidan and Elsa it was just repetitive .“You looked fucking adorable.” Aiden smiles.“Uh.. go back.” Ronan stares at Aiden as if he grew an additional head. “Did you just say ‘adorable’?”Aiden’s poker face returns.“No, no, no… don’t close off. Come on, King.” He retrieves his phone. “Say it again, I need to get it on camera.”Aiden stares at Ronan’s camera and mouths. “Fuck. You.”RONAN ASTOR LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 💗💗💗I loved the friendship between what they like to call the ‘four horsemen’ Aiden, Cole, Ronan and Xander the bonding between them, the funny cute moments but also the moments where they pissed one another off was definitely one of the highlights for me. Ronan has to be my fave he was just soo funny and for what. Him I LOVED 😂😂“Then who did you come for, hmm?” His eyes spark, and it pisses me off.”“Who do you think? I came for my boyfriend Xander.”“Go ahead, sweetheart. I dare you to say that again.”“I told you, sweetheart. You’re already mine, so stop acting otherwise.”Aiden and Elsa were confusing they pissed me off but I found them cute at times my feelings for them are definitely INCONSISTENT😭 one second I love them the next I wanna push both of them off a cliff. The obsessive jealousy I lovedTypical mehow Aiden couldn’t stand anyone near Elsa and was ready to drop his childhood friends for her and the fight between him and Xander was just 😍😍 come on we love a bit of jealousy maybe i love it a little too much“How did you know that I only eat that type of food?”“Your aunt was packing a vegetarian lunch and there was a special brand of biscuits with no fatty acid on your breakfast table.” He glances at me. “Besides, you only eat your lunchboxes at school.”“You’ve been watching me at school?”🥰🥰Their cute moments were definitely adorable. Aidan knowing every detail about Elsa the way he took care of her diet knowing what she could eat and what she couldn’t had my heart he wasn’t a complete psychopath but I’m not denying that he’s not one like he’s still 99.9% a confirmed psychopath 😂😂 BUT THEIR CUTE MOMENTS IN MY OPINION WERNT ENOUGH AFTER THE WHOLE PHONE SCENE I JUST CAN'T GET OVER IT“I have a rule: Never try to understand bullies.”she really needs to re read her own rules💀😂“I called you by your stupid last name, what else are you waiting for? Hail to the king?”fully rolling 😂😂I loved elsa at the start but she irritated me as the book went along she started off so strong and indestructible not allowing aiden to break her and get his way with her only for her to give into him. The one scene that triggered me was when she hit silver like yess silver is a bitch but the whole scene gave me second hand embarrassment like if you want to hit anyone hit Aiden he’s the one with her it just cringed me out. SHE LITERALLY WENT FROM IM NOT TAKING SHIT FROM ANYONE TO PERSONAL DOORMAT .“Why do you think no one asked you out these past two years?” Xander lifts an eyebrow.”“It’s his way to eliminate competition.”“What will you do if I somehow cheat?” I’m treading into a dangerous territory, but curiosity gets the better of me.“Kill the bastard.” No hesitation.“How about me?”He cups my jaw with false tenderness. “That’s the difference between you and me, sweetheart. You’d leave me in a heartbeat if I cheat, but I’ll never leave you even if you cheat.”Aiden is definitely a deranged psycho you love her but then create these rumours about her and her biology teacher and for what to take out the competition I thought your the most popular guy then what’s the insecurity about . The fact that he brought silver on his arm to piss Elsa off to get her to admit she likes him was hilarious like drastic much .His eye twitching got me I can just imagine it every time he got pissed like hello that’s cringe but funny at the same time😂😂😂I loved that this was set in England because finally I knew the towns but out of all them Kent chose Birmingham whyy? If you live in Birmingham I swear I’m not hating now as a huge premier league fan It sucked that the team that everyone loved was Arsenal i wish it was Manchester United Well now you know where I live😭🥹Can we talk about Xander and Kim because there’s clearly something between them I want to see what the deal is with him because he’s clearly obsessed with her but such a prick to her .SPOILERS AHEAD ⚠️⚠️⚠️What I hated was the whole phone scene because there’s a fine line between bullying and assault and let’s be honest he assaulted her my guy had his hand down her top and then kissed her heart surgery scar that guy had some weird obsession with that scar it was really creepy. I’ll always hate Aiden for that it was unforgivable THE ONLY REASON WHY IM NOT LOWERING MY RATING IS BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT ITS A BULLY ROMANCE WHERE IT IS MADE CLEAR BUT WAS IT NECESSARY NO IT WAS DISGUSTING“Are you, Elsa? Because I was never supposed to like you this much. Hell. I wasn’t supposed to think about you more than I think of myself.”This is making more sense now because he can’t love the girl who’s parents were responsible for his mothers death 😭Now what was this ending that first encounter with Aiden made sense it falls into place. Was he with Elsa to get revenge for the death of his mum because if that’s the case I’m pissed for her because he even had me believing that he was obsessed and infatuated with her.This whole cliff hanger is killing me it’s what brought this book together I DID NOT SEE IT COMING .SPOILERS END HERE ⚠️⚠️⚠️This ends on a cliff hanger which I might add is AMAZING so you know what that means I’m reading the next book I hope that the second book is more interesting with a proper plot and WE GET MORE RONAN CONTENT BECAUSE I FULLY LOVE HIM 🥹💕 This book wasn't the best sooo 1 star for Ronan 1 star for the cover and 1 star for the cliff-hanger which made it interesting i think my maths is mathsing. Just a word of advice this book has quite a bit of Smutt which I didn’t read so if you like that then you’ll probably love this I say this every time as I did a lot of skipping
