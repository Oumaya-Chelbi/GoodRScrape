I didn't like this series.The first book is your typical poor girl who goes to an Elite school and the rich and most popular guys and girls hate for no reason.The second and third book is a mix of that amazing Australian soap opera called "Return To Eden" and C.M. Stunich RH series.There's some errors that could have been avoided if the books were proofread.The timeline is confusing too. Lily has her accident before the end of the first term of junior year, spends months in hospital for surgery and physical therapy, becomes a champion in diving at the same time, becomes a Diamond at the end of term 1. How? Also she says to one of the twins that she's not the same girl he met a year ago. Well duh, he didn't even know her the year before.The whole bullying has no point. Chloe disappears at the beginning of book 3, and as the epilogue says, they all spent their senior year in good spirit. You'd think Grace had a trick or two in her bag, but no.And the Lily's vengeance was so weak and pitiful. Like she decides to starve herself for no reason because all the guys are already hot for her. She also dresses like a rich girl and changes her entire personality. Like ok for the clothes but come on, you can't switch to ice queen mode because you want it.I don't understand how Lily went from cool to warm to Charlie from book 2 to 3. No explanation.The app was useless too.Everybody had the cards to know who was the villain but they were too stupid and horny to realise it. Lily should have dropped Asher like a hot potato because he was guilty af.The guys truly never apologised for how cruel they were to Lily and I didn't feel their connection at all. The worst was Liam. The man just appears one year later at the end of the book to join the harem. Makes no sense at all.
