✅✅ VERY explicit mut✅ Pace✅🆗 Characters and character development✅🆗 Funny🆗❌ Plot🆗❌ VillainI have a few issues with this book, I did not enjoy it as much as I hoped to, but the ending is promising and intriguing, so I will probably continue with the next book just to see if the plot finally moves forward and things finally start to change.This book is basically smut upon smut, with a dash of non-sexual action scenes, conversations that often are full of sexual innuendos, and a bunch of cringe-worthy sexual letters exchange.“What are your plans for this evening, Miss Finley?” Hadriel called.I paused in swinging my legs over. “Did you just call me Miss Finley?”He rolled his eyes. “I apologize. What came over me?”“Sense,” Jawson drawled.Hadriel shot him a scowl. “I was going to say I got swept up with these nitwits, but sense left them years ago.”“Keep talking, shitstain, and we’ll get to that wrestling match,” Gyril muttered.“Suck a rock, Gyril.” Hadriel gave me a grin, a twinkle in his eye. “Forgive me, my love. I lost the color in my personality for a moment. What a boring butler I would be then. What are you doing this evening?”“Sir…” Hadriel looked between Nyfain and me.“Go with her. Make sure she…” He rolled his shoulders. “On second thought, come with me. You can hold the horses. You couldn’t help her anyway.”“There’s the spirit, sir. Insult my masculinity whilst forcing me to spend prolonged time in your presence, which will likely make me shit myself before the day is through. Fantastic. I will look forward to my eventual demoralization.”“That’s it, I’m going to commission a maid outfit. I’ll be your second maid, how’s that? I’ll be with you every step of the way, doll. I won’t leave you to brave the demons on your own. You need a damsel to keep you level. I’m the best damn damsel there ever was. I scream right on pitch.”Thankfully, Hadriel was there to save the day with his funny moments. he never fails to make me laugh.While there is a plot, it's weak and does not progress much during the 400 pages of this book. This story is really more focused on the romance and relationship development between Finley and Nyfain, which is not a bad thing, but I was looking for something a little more plot-driven. Don't get me wrong, I love the smut and sexy moments, but I also wanted a more grasping storyline. If you remove all the sex scenes from the book, the plot is very thin (and the book is about 100 pages shorter). It gets much better near the end, which is why I will probably give the third book a chance, but the rest of the book is just sex, sex, and more sex (again, not a bad thing, but I was looking for a plot, not just sex).“No. It is my job to protect you. It’s my entire duty as your—” He cut off.I patted his chest. “Exactly. You’re not my mate, and you haven’t claimed me. I’ve given you plenty of opportunities, but you’ve held back because you were preparing for this moment. So let me have my moment.”Talking about the romance... Well, I am not surprised by ANYTHING that was revealed at the end of the book in the (awkward) letter Nyfain wrote to Finley. I had already guessed everything that he said while reading the first book a few weeks ago. I don't know if the author was aiming for a "big reveal" kinda moment, but it was more a confirmation of everything I already strongly suspected, and even Finley admitted that she already knew too... Also, I LOVE angst, but in that case, the whole "you're not my mate so I know we will get separated and it breaks my heart but I want to enjoy it while it lasts" coming from Finley, and Nyfain being all gruff and shady and not talking about it had me roll my eyesbecause WE ALL KNEW from the start that they were true mates.The letters are also something that bothered me. Finley and Nyfain spend the first 10% of the book staying away from each other, even though their animals are clearly telling them that they NEED to be together. They try to keep their distance, but they exchange sexy and explicit letters almost every day. Honestly, the letters were not really sexy in my humble opinion, it was more cheesy and cringe-worthy than hot and sexy (I mean, masturbating because of sexy talk in a letter? Really?!).I was also curious about this mysterious Demon King that we keep hearing about, but he showed up for the last 5%-10% of the book only, and I was not impressed by him. At All. He was not that cunning or evil, he just seemed like a vain demon hungry for power... Finley kept on sassing him and telling him that he was a dumb fuck and he just let her do it. He calmly explained that he'd strike a bargain and would take Finley with him and after a short discussion with Nyfain she just decided to roll with it because that's what they've been expecting from the start (there is logic in that decision, but I would still have tried to fight it).So... I would definitely recommend this book if you are looking for a huge load of very explicit smut, and do not care if the plot is thin and weak. It is not a bad book, but it is just not what I was hoping for. I wanted more information about the damn curse and more Nyfain (it doesn't count when he's just pounding into her). I will still probably continue with this series because I'm very curious to see how things will turn out now that Finley is going with the Demon King, and I am really hoping that the next book will be less sex and more plot.1.A Ruin of Roses⭐⭐⭐⭐Follow me on Instagram🙂
