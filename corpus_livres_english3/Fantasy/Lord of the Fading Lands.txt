Final rating: 4/5 starsFinal rating - for the whole series: 5/5 stars“Ver reisa ku'chae. Kem surah, shei'tani. Your soul calls out. Mine answers, beloved.”After readingThe Winter Kingby C.L. Wilson, I decided to finally read this series as well. It was recommended to me by one of my close friends, and she said that I would love it. She wasn't wrong, because yes, I do love it.This is the first book in a series of five, and as expected, it had a very slow beginning. The first part mainly focuses on the romance between the two main characters, while in the background, the main plot starts revealing itself.I have to say that I enjoyed the book, it made me laugh sometimes. Overall, I loved the idea for the story. Characters were interesting as well, especially secondary characters (there were many of them), because they weren't one dimensional, but rather, nicely developed as well. I loved that the author added POVs of the enemies as well, as well as of other secondary characters.You might be scared by the number of the characters that appear and their names, but don't worry, you will remember most of them while you read.This is a story of Mages, humans, Fey and Tairen. Fey and Tairen races are connected - they cannot live without each other. Tairen are large winged cats and sometimes a Fey which can shapeshift into Tairen is born. They are called "Tairen Soul" and they are masters of all elements: air, fire, earth, water and soul. But the problem lies in the fact that Tairen race is dying out, and because of their connection, the Fey race is dying out as well. Mages, however, are the natural enemies of Fey, and they want to destroy Fey, once and for all. The humans do not believe that they are in any danger from the Elden Mages, because they don't feel the rising power of the their darkness.____________________________________________CHARACTERS:____________________________________________♦Rain Tairen Soul:Rainier vel’En Daris Feyreisen, the Tairen Soul, King of the Fading Lands, is an ancient Fey, having lived for thousands of years. His mission is to save his race and Tairen race from dying out. A long time ago, while the Fey had been in war with Elden Mages, his mate Sariel died and Rain almost destroyed the world. Now, the evil that had calmed down is raising again, and only he can feel it - the Elden Mages are regaining their power but he has no proof of it. If they rise, it will be hard battle to win and there will be a lot of fatalities. But that is not all - Rain, broken and hopeless, as well as the last Tairen Soul - hears the call of a woman who turns out to be his truemate - literally another half of his soul. And she is the only one who can save them - or at least, that's what he saw in the visions by The Eye of Truth (basically a large magical crystal ball). If only it were easy to bond with her....Rain was interesting and loveable character, and considering what he went through, I understand his protectiveness over other people and his truemate. Having lost his mate in the War, it almost destroyed him. I love that he started out slow and didn't force anything, he was patient, caring and nice.♦Ellysetta Baristani:Ellie is just a commoner, living her life like an ordinary human, or so she thinks. Sometimes, things happen, that even she cannot explain - so she just ignores them and moves on (like having very scary nightmares). She thinks she is just a human, but what she doesn't know is that she is unconsciously using magic (she's adopted). Ellie loves the stories of the Fey, read many books and poetry about them and is generally fascinated with their race. Her parents, Sol and Lauriana, found her abandoned in the woods but they think of her as their own daughter. But now, they are getting worried because she is still not married and she is getting older.Ellie was kind and interesting heroine. Her life was turned upside down and she still managed to stay on her feet.♦Other characters:Den Brodsonis the guy who wants to marry Ellie. He is not an idiot, he noticed that Ellie is special, and he wants to possess her, no matter what. While Ellie's parents thought it was a good idea, they didn't know that Den is a very violent man. But what Den doesn't know is the fact that immortal Tairen Soul claimed her as his truemate (or soul mate if you prefer).Baristani familyconsists of Ellie, the adopted daughter of Sol & Lauriana and their twin daughters Lillis and Lorelle. They are a very nice, functional family, and they all care for eath other. They listen, they do what they think it's the best for their family and they are supportive. Lauriana though, fears magic. Sol is the woodcarver and protective of his children, but he also puts a lot of trust in them. The twins were just adorable.Selianne Pyersonis Ellie's best friend. Her mother, Tuelis, is Eld by origin and both of them are scared of what would happen if Rain and his people found that out. Except for that, she really likes Ellie.Queen Annoura and King Dorianare the rulers of Celieria, and they have a problem - should they indulge the Fey, or should they continue their trade with Eld. They are put in a very difficult position, because whatever choice they made, they might go in the war with other country - and Eld and Fey do not cooperate. Queen Annoura though was one of the queens who loves to use her position to her advantage, ordering around. What can I say, except that she was overjealous and irritating queen. Dorian, however, listened to reason, made good decisions and was rational king.Among the other Fey that appeared, there wereDax and his truemate Lady Marissya, a shei’dalin, a powerful Fey healer and Truthspeaker. Belliard, Kieran, Kiel, Rowan, and Adrial are the Fey sent to protect Ellie and guard her with their lives.Belliard vel Jelaniis the oldest Fey warrior, and Rain's friend, as well as master of Spirit.Kieran vel Solandeis the son of Marissya and Dax and master of earth, as well as the last child born to the Fey people.Kiel vel Tomaris a master of Water magic.Rowan and Adrial vel Arquinasare brothers. Rowan is a master of Fire, and Adrial of Air.Kolis Manza and High Mage Vadim Maurare the antagonists of this series. Being Mages of Eld, they want to bring down the Fey and destroy them once and for all. Preferably make them a very hated race as well.Dahl’reisenare the lost souls - unmated Fey warriors who have been banished from the Fading Lands - "for breaking Fey taboos or for choosing to walk the Shadowed Path rather than committing sheisan’dahlein, the honor death, when the weight of all the lives they have taken in defense of the Fey becomes too great for thier own souls to bear". Among them is the brother of Marissya brother,Gaelen vel Serraniswho couldn't get over his twin's death.And in the end, there areSian and Torel, Fey that were given the mission to find out Ellie's origins.____________________________________________OVERALL:____________________________________________Even though it's one of the Soulmates stories, i really enjoyed it. Why? Because nothing was rushed, and while they are soul mates, they have yet to understand each other and make a proper bond - meaning, they need to slowly fall in love with each other. So, nothing is done in rush, and that made me love it even more.It was a nice beginning for the series, a bit slow, with a very detailed world building, which sometimes makes it hard to process. I was a bit confused at the beginning, but after a while, I understood everything. Anyway, a nice start for the series, although very slow, therefore only 4 stars.____________________________________________● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ●____________________________________________MY TAIREN SOUL REVIEWS:◉Lord of the Fading Lands (Tairen Soul #1)◉Lady of Light and Shadows (Tairen Soul, #2)◉King of Sword and Sky (Tairen Soul, #3)◉Queen of Song and Souls (Tairen Soul, #4)◉Crown of Crystal Flame (Tairen Soul, #5)
