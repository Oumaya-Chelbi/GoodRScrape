**Update to review on second readthrough**I have to say, I still adore this series, I do think that the second one is better than the first but now being able to see all the foreshadowing of things to come and the set up I think that there is so much to be excited for and I look forward to continuing my reread of this series.I think this book really builds on the Gavin/Daizen conundrum and the intricacies of the politics start to show themselves a little. Gavin is forced to make some harsh choices and along the way he struggles with his own demons and problems too.I hate Liv and her naive way of looking at things, really she drives me mad.Kip continues to take all the beatings you could think of and remain cynical and silly and funny and positive all at once. I think you just have to root for him still.My rating remains a 5*s**Update to review on second readthrough**This book was SO much better than the first one. I did enjoy the first book in this series and I gave it a 4* rating, however considering that all the previous Brent Weeks books I have read have been instant 5* reads I was hoping that the first in the Lightbringer series would be too, but of course that wasn't quite the case.The biggest niggle or issue that I had with book 1 of this series was that I felt as though there was a lot of focus on explaining the magic and this meant that the characters and plot were not quite as awesome as I would have liked. This book blows the first one away with the complex but action-packed plot and the growth of the characters.I really loved learning about the different Chromeria politics and intricacies. We see a lot more of the political players and manoeuvres in this book than we got hints at in the first and Kip (the main character) is right in the centre of everything. We get to follow Kip as he tries to integrate into the Chromeria despite the challenges that his past brings, and we also follow him as he battles with becoming a Black Guard.I absolutely loved learning about Andross Guile and the game of Nine Kings. The scenes between Kip and Andross were a lot of fun and wonderfully constructed so that I was always intrigued as to what the outcome would be. The cards of Nine Kings and Nine Kings in general were all beautifully described and the game sounded awesome for sure! (maybe we'll see that sometime in the future, who knows). I loved how this game was a platform for betrayal and manipulation of our characters, and how there's a lot of crafty tricks that you can employ.Some of the other newer characters or characters I particularly enjoyed seeing more of include:Kip - the main character who is rather self-depreciating and fat, is a slightly irritating character at points of book 1. By book 2 he seems to know a lot more about what he wants to do with his life and how to get there so even when he fails he's trying, and that counts. He's a great character because he starts with a large weakness and slowly he learns the advantages of his body and mind and plays to these. He's certainly one of those who comes the furthest over the course of the book.Andross Guile - the secret and closeted Red Saitrap who keeps himself to himself but is pretty much pulling all of the strings. He's a manipulative genius with a lot of flair for fiery outbursts and crafty manoeuvres. I loved seeing the interactions he had and how he used Grimwoody for his evil purposes, and they made a creepy and nasty (but wonderful to read about) pair.Teia - is a wonderful new addition to the story and comes in the form of a slave. She is being kept by a pretty nasty woman, and she's being moved like a player in the game against the Guiles, however, when she soon befriends Kip and sees him training alongside her to become a Black Guard, well loyalties get tested and resolve is difficult. I found Teia and her struggles to be one of the best storylines and also one of the most intimidating. She's been through and goes though a lot in the book, but she's a great character with a lot of personality despite all that. Certainly another character whom I was watching and interested in!Gavin Guile - is the Prism for the Chromeria and he's a wonderful character with a lot of the plot in this book focussing on him also. He's certainly a little unpredictable and this makes him someone whom it's fun to follow as you're never truly certain just what may happen next. He's also got a lot on his plate and when unpredictable and scary things come into his plotline he faces them head-on and continues to do what he believes is the right thing.Liv - is a young girl now in an entirely different situation to that of the first book. She's separated from her earlier friends and family and is instead focused on the enemy. Her plot gives us glimpses at the 'other side', which was interesting, yet she is a character I didn't particularly care for and I think the only one who I am yet to grow fond of in any way.Karris and Ironfist were also both wonderful, although a little more minor, and I think they're both great characters in their own rights too!The plot itself is largely focused around the battle for power and control between gavin and The Chromeria against the Colour Prince. We get to see both sides, although Gavin and Kip's sides are the focus, and the constant battle is always prevalent in the plot lines. However this book has a whole lot more going on than the first in terms of multiple plotlines and various weavings of the story all coalescing together. There's a lot of smaller character plots which are highly interesting and these feed into the overall story.We also see an awful lot of magical expansion both in the form of our main characters learning more about their own abilities, and also in terms of learning about new weapons, ideas and colours we didn't know of before. A WHOLE LOT of stuff is always going on, and that does mean that you have to pay attention. However, this is great as it means Weeks is not assuming that his audience are dumb or can't follow it and he gives us lots to chew over and think on, with hints at what might be coming in book 3 interspersed too.Basically this book was wonderful and even though it took a while for me to read it all (due to uni work and the end of the year) whenever I did get a chance to read it I thoroughly enjoyed it and didn't want it to be over. I already own book 3 and fully plan on starting it sometime very soon :) I can't wait!!A wonderful 5*s!!
