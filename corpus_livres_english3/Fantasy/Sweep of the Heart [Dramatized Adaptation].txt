2/26/24 rereadAgain the graphic audio was a wonderful way to experience this world. I really enjoyed the whole spousal search with all the sound effects and different narrators. I highly recommend this series in graphic audio format.________________________________Series:Innkeeper Chronicles #5Rating:4 stars - It was really goodDina DeMille and Sean Evans life gets very chaotic when Wilmos, Sean’s werewolf mentor, gets kidnapped. But to find him they have to first survive hosting an intergalactic spouse-search for one of the most powerful rulers in the Galaxy.This was wonderful. From the very beginning, I didn’t want to put this book down, but I also didn’t want it to end. Dina and Sean are hosting a huge group of people, all of which live to kill their enemies. I don’t enjoy spouse searching shows, but Andrews made this whole situation exciting and intense. I think it helped that the aliens who are participating in this spouse-search were all very interesting and deadly. We also get to see the return of the vampires, the Otrokar, and the Merchant Clan.We finally learn more about Caldenia and why she has to stay at Gertrude Hunt. It was great finally getting to learn about this lady who has been a constant present throughout this book. I was very surprised by what we learned about her. Dina also finally gets some information about her parents' inn and I really can’t wait to see how she deals with that information in the future.“Sometimes you say things that make me wonder about you.” “No need to wonder. I’m a simple man. I love you and I will protect you. And the inn. Even if I have to murder Caldenia and everyone else to do it.”My favorite part of this book was seeing Dina and Sean work together to host this event. They have always had a strong connection but in this we really see them work in harmony to create with Gertrude Hunt and protect their residents. I just loved seeing them work together and lean on each other during the hard times. I really want more stories of these two hosting aliens and dealing with difficult cases.My only complaint was that I wasn’t a fan of the recaps at the beginning of each chapter. I can understand why that was handy when this was a serial and coming out every week but for a novel format, I think it was just useless. I skipped it after the first chapter.You can also find my reviews atRed-Haired Ash Reads.
