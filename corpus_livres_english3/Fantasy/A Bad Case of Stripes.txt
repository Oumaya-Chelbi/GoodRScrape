Camilla Cream is so frustrated on the first day of school. She feels that she has many people to impress and feels that she has to look her best. In the mid of all this stress, she breaks into a bad case of the stripes. She is covered from head to toe in stripes and does not understand the reason why. The doctors check her put they cannot think what may have caused the stripes. She goes to school and is considered a distraction to the rest of the class and is asked to stay home. So many people try to help her and cure the stripes but each time it only gets worse and worse. Until an old sweet lady offered her help and she gave Camilla lima beans which cured everything. Camilla was too worried about always fitting in and impressing others that she began to put aside what she really wanted. This is a great book to have students realize that it is ok to be different.This is a good book to use at the beginning of the school year. We need to let our students know to be theirself and not do things to please others. Students should accept theirself. This is also a book that can be used as a strategy of showing students how things are put together (even themselves). Students can work on a puzzle and verbalize the strategy used to put the puzzle together. This can work to show students that we can begin the story in different parts or event that it is okay to be different.
