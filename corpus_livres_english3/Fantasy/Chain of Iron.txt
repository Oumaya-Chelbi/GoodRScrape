My reviews of 'The Last Hours' trilogy:- Chain of Gold:⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐- Chain of Iron: ⭐⭐⭐⭐- Chain of Thorns:⭐3.75 rounding up to 4 stars- because apparently I'm too attached to the charaters and can't seem to bring myself rating the book lower than 4 stars.I think the title 'Chain of Iron' would have been more suiting if it were actually named: 'Chain of Miscommunications and Keeping Secrets'.Attention! This review includes:⁃	Spoilers⁃	Unpopular opinions⁃	Rant⁃	Me babbling over characters⁃	Fanarts⁃	And many moreWas this better or worse than Chain of Gold? Neither, because both of them are completely different from each other with different plot lines despite the characters being the same.But if I have to compare with 'The Infernal Devices' or rather 'Clockwork Prince' in this case (unpopular opinion time) I’d say this was better, yet again. TLH characters are behaving more like teenagers, obviously - because they're in fact are teenagers, meanwhile TID characters behaved like adults, and for me that is bothersome and a bit unrealistic to me.While I was going through my book and searching quotes that I kept tabs on, I realized that The Last Hours espeially Chain of Iron focuses so much on love and more romantic love as a matter of fact than other plotlines.Relationships:-Blackdale/Ghostwriter:I wanted to start off with these two, because they've become my ultimate OTP! Lucie and Jesse are literally Edwardian version of Romeo and Juliet (No! I'm not a fan of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet). Lucie and Jesse's romance was not rushed I see that a lot in reviews people find their relationship rushed or even toxic because of the age gap, which is only 7 years and in the 20th century that used to be normal, but we all know that Jesse is stuck at the age of 17, after his death he hasn't aged, at all. Don't forget that this book takes place 4 or 5 months after book 1 and in book 1 they slowly becoming fond of one another, plus in the past 4 or 5 months after the events of book 1 they hung out almost every night so naturally it was going to happen. It was them who had the best communication when it came to express their feelings towards one aother.-Gracetopher- (I know, they had literally one or two scenes together but I'm already shipping them): I Would love to see more development with Grace and Christopher together and as individuals, these two nerds has so much potential to become a couple. Not to mention I have a soft spot for science geek couples.-Jordelia:If only these two weren't stupid enough to realize that both parties are indeed madly in love with eah other. There are a lot of moments between these two that I found very swoon-worthy.''He is not yours. He is mine. He ismine.''Art by lita.fleurWhat I didn't like:- Elias’s death wasn’t discussed enough. I know he was not the best person and he kind of deserved that death, truthfully I didn't even bat an eye when he got murdered. But him dying felt as passive as the other unimportant Shadowhunters.- Cordelia needed to stand up more for Alastair. I mean she literally met the Merry Thieves gangand she chooses them over her own brother, just to ''please'' them. I really like Cordelia, but I found it horrible on her part that while Alastair did everything to protect his little sister and his families reputation ever since he was young and Cordelia seems so blind over his actions.Cordelia and Lucie's friendship, because I think this needed to be discussed:Cordelia and Lucie may not have been as close as they were in book 1 or as I was anticipating them to, but the friendship within the group is fantastic. It’s the kind of the friendship that everyone desires to have and experience at least once in their lifetime. It is also obvious both of them care deeply for one another, but it's understandable how they've grown apart from each other, since both of them are consumed with their own problems and secrets. I see that how many people blamed it on Lucie on how she is the one who ''ruined'' their friendship or the fact that they aren't as close as they used to due to her teaming up with Grace to resurrect Jesse, but that blame should be put as much on Cordelia, as well. Their Parabatai(to be)bond was a bit off and I guess I just don't like seeing female friendships getting ruined because of guys.I'm rooting for them to be better friends to one another and trust each other more in the final book. It has been their dream to be each other's Parabatais and I would hate to see if they keep more secrets from each other.“You cannot save people who do not want to be saved," said Magnus. "You can only stand by their side and hope that when they wake and realize they need saving, you will be there to help them.”Characters I want to talk about a bit:-Alastair:He deserves someone that’ll truly love him and not mistreat him like Elias or Charles did. Now I do like him and Thomas together very much and they fit together, but Thomas in my opinion is still isn't comfortable enough with his sexuality and I don't want seeing Alastair getting hurt yet again. I started appreciating Alastair more in this book. When I read Chain of Gold for the first time I didn't pay much attention on him. However that changed entirely when I re-read the first book, now that I've read the second book as well he has easily become a favorite character of mine.-Grace:I know Grace is a disliked person and others portrayed her as being one of the villains of The Last Hours trilogy, but we have to look at her life from her own perspective and in a non judgmental way. I think Cassie made a great choice on adding Grace chapters in this book. I never hated Grace, neither in book 1. I always saw her as a complex character, I mean she has got to be one of the most well written and developed morally grey characters in YA literature. Her actions are understandable (yes, at times also dislikeable), she has been both emotionally and physically been abused ever since she was a little girl by a woman that hasn't even adopted but BOUGHT her!!!I think the best way to look at Grace's personality is to compare her to the Ying Yang sign; There's a little badness in every good person just as a little goodness in every evil character.-Ariadne:I wanted to see Ariadne/Kamala on her own when she wasn’t obsessing over Anna or wanting her to get back it’s like her entire arc revolved around Anna. I know she has a big room for more developement and I loved how in the end she ended her ''fling'' with Anna and chose herself for the first time. This does not mean I don't want Anna and Ariadne to be together. I just hated the direction both of them book relationship wise in this book.-Charles:I don't understand all the hate that Charles gets, I mean yes, he's annoying, and arrogant, but look at it this way: His entire life he wanted to be a politician and a part of the counsil, because Charlotte also inspired him. But he is in that period of time where being what he was was not acceptable and he has to hide by faking engagements and relationships with other women.-Tatiana:How petty and messed up can you get?! Just because once upon a time when you all were barely teenagers Will Herondale rejected you, you decide to turn your own kids against them? Even if I do a teeny tiny bit sorry for her, I don't see her redeemable at all. I hope she wouldn't survive in the last book, meaning: she dies in Chain of Thorns!-Lastly:I think we can all agree that the most unproblematic character was Oscar the Golden Retriever.“If I must fade,' he said, 'I would like to fade remembering this as my last waking dream.''Don't go,' she whispered. 'Hold on, for me. We are so close.'He touched her cheek. 'Only promise me one thing,' he said. 'If I do go, give us a happy ending, will you? In your book?''I don't believe in endings,' she said, but he only smiled at her, and faded slowly from view.”Art by lasq.draws“When I am with you, I imagine that my heart is beating, though it has not beaten for seven years. You give me so much, and I can give you nothing at all.”Love triangle/square:The entire James, Cordelia and Matthew love triangle has overshadowed the rest of TLH cast's romances, character arcs and developements. Most of them felt rushed because of that unnecessary love triangle.Unpopular opinion alert!!!I think if Cassie wanted to add a love triangle (since its her specialty) she should have done it between Matthew, Lucie and Jesse. That would have made much more sense. Since Matthew has been in love with Lucie or at least had a crush on her most of his life, even though she constantly rejected him, because she only sees him as ''brother'' or brother's best friend.While this trilogy till now mainly focuses on the love triangle between Matthew Cordelia and James and it is boring and there shouldn't have been a love triangle between those three in the first place, if anything it's a love square since Grace is included in it too, even if it's beacause of the bracelet, but both books began with Lucie so Lucie is once again being overlooked again despite having a major roll in one of the most important plot lines.Also a theory of mine is that Matthews and Lucie’s friendship/possible romance in the next book. Let's look at it this way, whenever someone asks Matthew about Lucie and where their friendship/relationship stands he always seems to find a way to change the subject on that matter. While I may be overthorizing everything, but I think this may be a future reference or foreshadowing to their relationship in the last book. I hope matthews feelings/crush he has/had for Lucie will be more explored because everytime someone speaks for that topic he somehow avoids it. That must mean something, right?“When you want something very much, you are willing to accept the shadow of that thing. Even if it is just a shadow.”Last chapter aka the most hateable chapter of all time:The last chapter was overly dramatic and anticlimactic, ridiculous yet angsty all at the same time . It was awful and I hated it.If the ending were only that James could catch Cordelia from the train, tells her about Lucie and how she has been kidnapped by Malcolm she would’ve left the train and go with James to save her future parabatai. And that way Matthew could've stayed in the train instead amd went to Paris on his own. I think he needed to figure all his feelings alone without any more drama near him. We all know Cordelia doesn't love him romantically nor she ever would, because for her it has always been James and no one else. So him going to Paris with Cordelia will only hurt him more.Here's the thing, Matthew was at wrong for doing what he did at the end, I don’t hate him and while Cordelia was at wrong here too. She was under a lot of pressure, she wanted to become an ideal daughter/wife, but at the end she saw that everyone disappointed her, so she decides to run away from all that, that was very understandable. But with your husband's parabatai? That was just plain stupid on her part.Art by Laira BlogEpilogue:When Belial saying Jesse has done an excellent job then he winced. I know I’m overthinking but why did he wince or does all of this have other secret meanings too? I love Jesse Blackthorn, he's so kind, caring and precious. However, there comes times, even when I read Chain of Gold for the first time that he's faking his friendship with Lucie and is using her, but the reality is that he's working with his mother and Bellial. I alway get the feeling that he somehow he would turn out to be a villain working along with his mother and Belial and has been using Lucie all along.Also, this is the second time that the epilogue ends with Belial and Tatiana. Obviously because they’re the main villains of this trilogy. But think about it, the Blackthorns are playing a major role in this trilogy it’s just that basically everyone is being overlooked because of the unnecessary love triangle between James, Cordelia and Matthew. I think the last book is going to focus more on Jesse, Grace and Tatiana. Not to mention that the title itself has the word Thorns in it and Jesse's pendant has thorns on it too plus their house was always surrounded with thorns.“...sometimes you cannot reconcile with someone else. Sometimes you have to find that reconciliation on your own. Someone who broke your heart is often not the person who can mend it.”In conclusion:Was this book flawless? Of course not! There were so many good moments as much as moments that made me angry. Although this doesn't need to sound too surprising, since it's the second books in series, especially if it's a trilogy. They (middle books) tend to be the most bizzare installement in the most bizzare way (and good and bad).The book itself didn’t blow me away. It was adversitied to be more scandalous and dramatic, but hey to me this was the perfect Jesse and Lucie book and I love them a little too much and if it weren’t for their sweet and overly tender moments together I don’t think I would’ve given this the rating that I gave, despite the fact that I enjoyed most of it, except the last chapter.While I do understand this doesn’t quite as good as the previous book, it keept me on the edge of the seat almost during the entire time. I myself am not the biggest Shadowhunters fanatic since I haven’t read the most important sagas, however, 'Chain of Iron' wasn’t as bad as I saw everyone was describing it.I don’t know how is Cassie going to be able to fit all of these characters’ plot lines into the last and final book and it’s going to be a humongous book for sure. I just hope she is going to give each and every single character their own time to shine and that there would be no plot holes.********************************************Did I finish this book or did the book finishme?!*****************************Am I...finally reading this book? Yes!!!Let's do thisAlexandra.********************************************************I'm in agony right now. Why? Because my copy won't be arriving anytime soon. I have to wait from 2 to 3 weeks. 😭😭 In the meantime I'm going to read the novellas that are about TLH characters, because I need TLH content like right now.***************************************************By the angel!!!!! Only one more month till we have to endure for torture, heartbreak and lots and lots of sobbing (I'm sure).I have never been moreterrifiedexcited for a sequel than I am for Chain of Iron.*Impatiently counting down the days...********************************************ADSVDHVDJINJFDW I JUST SAW THE COVER AND i'M FREAKING OUT!!!!!My favorite Herondale is on the cover and Lucie is finally getting the appreciation that she deserves. 🙌🏻🙌🏻👏🏻👏🏻I though the Dark Artifices has the best book covers among the shadowhunters series, but the Last Hours is breaking that record.Also, can we talk about the cover. I mean there are so many details to observe. (But I’m tagging them as spoilers)Alright, here are my theories regarding the cover:⁃ The moths: I know they’re Grace’s favorite animal/insects, so maybe it’s represents Lucie’s alliance with Grace about resurrecting Jesse. Also moths may symbolize as bad omens? Which means Lucie will definitely be in so much danger.⁃ She’s holding Jesse’s locket. THE FREAKIN’ BLACKTHORN LOCKET!!!! Which means we get to see a lot of Jesse.⁃ The place on the cover looks like the forest where her and Jesse first met.⁃ It seems to me that she’s kind of floating. I’m 100% sure that she’ll explore and gets to know more about her powers and why she can see not just regular ghosts but every kind of them, I’m not sure about this but maybe she’ll have ghost-like abilities?⁃ Her rune is glowing. I don’t know much about the runes, but can it mean anything?⁃ Also, I can’t decide if her dress is yellow or golden, because if it’s golden... we all know what a golden dress is used for when it comes to shadowhunters. 😱😱That’s all I have to say about the cover for now, but oh boy am I terrified of what’ll happen in this book. Oh, and the synopsis has left me SHOOK!!!!!
