— 4.5 Stars ★“Men want power because it makes them feel good. Women want power because it lets us do things.Carissa did it again! She again proved she can never write a bad book in her life.Because ascended fucking above this book was amazing.The story, the plotline, the twists and the characters. Everything was amazing. Though the first half of the book is slow because of all the world building and characters introduction but the second half had me in a chokehold. Because so many things were happening and all the pain that Max and Tisaanah went through was too much 💔😭“It begins with two souls who find themselves suddenly, utterly alone.”╰┈➤ Read this if you like➛ Amazing world building➛ Thrilling action sequences➛ Power and Magic wielders➛ Strong, resilient and powerful MCs➛ A very slow burn and tender romanceThis book is more about Tisaanah's journey and how she survived in Threll when she was a slave for Esmarisand how she tried to bought her freedom from him and how it led her to realise what her powers are. I hated how he treated her when she always treated Esmaris as her family even though he is the one of those people who were responsible for what happened to her homeland and her family. Later Ti arrived at Ara, a land where no one knew her, a language she never knew, just read in some Ara books.It was beautiful to see her language journey, her power wielding journey and everthing in Ara and how she thrived in Ara all on her own and also with Max's help.Romance is a very small part of this book but it still was mesmerisingly beautiful.“Our bodies asked and answered, ceded to each other, moved with unhindered intuition. Together, we burned.”“It’s easy to die for someone,” I said, “but it is so much more valuable to live. I do not give you permission to fail if I fail. Do you understand me?”When he didn’t answer, I pressed, “Do you understand?”“Yes,” he whispered.I've always loved Carissa's intricate and exquisite writing and her storytelling is incredible. Its just flows that you can't help but read more and more. Also this one is action packed and I enjoyed all those thrilling fighting scenes and they were written so well and perfect intricate details that kept me on edge. The way Carissa described Ti's powers and those butterflies of hers, it was incredible and the last fighting scene of Max and Tisaanah had me crying but it was just 🔥“I was too young to know the truth then. That victory meant another’s defeat, and sometimes our own defeat. That winning meant sacrifices, and sometimes ones that even our own people were not willing to make. That in war, someone always paid.”“Every moment in life was a coin with one dark side and one light. They fell on the ground with one side facing up, but the other always lay beneath it, there, but hidden.”✦ Tisaanah VytezicʻThe daughter of no and all worldsʼA fragmented girl who has no home and no family except a friend Serel in threll and she is determined to set all the slaves free from the cruelty of the world she lived in and where she gave all of herself to the men who never knew how incredible she is. She is intelligent and a badass with relentless determination who always fights for whats better no matter what. I loved her so much and her character development in this was amazingly written. I hope she kills all the people who gave her those battle scars and ahe deserves all the happiness in this world and Max ❤️‍🩹“I never allowed myself to be seen as a threat. There was power in being underestimated.”✦ Maxantarius FarlioneNo matter how handsome and hot he was in the beginning I just couldn't like him then. Because when Nura took Ti to Max for his help he denied and was behaving like a cocky and a self centered asshole. It took me some time to love him but honestly he is the best and tge way he cared for Ti and helped her with everything was just beautiful 💘Also he is the softest and sweetest grumpy MMC Carissa has ever written which made me love him more.He is grumpy, intelligent and strong and loves to being left alone. And the moment I learned about his dark past and what that monster Reshaye made him do that I was sobbing for him. He deserves so much better and I'll protect with everything 🥺“If this wasn’t the end, then I was ready to write a better fucking conclusion this time. Whatever it took.”➙ Tisaanah and Max's RelationshipAt first they both disliked each other so much but the more they spent time together, the more they tried to know each other and they tried to understand their choices and their behaviour. I loved how their friendship developed from a trainer-trainee relationship to friends and then to lovers. They both always helped each other no matter what situation is andMax gave Ti a home. A home she never knew she needed. Everything about them is comfort ❤️‍🩹“Still, I didn’t realize. Not when I agreed to let her into my house, or my mind, or my past. Not even when I realized that every time I was without her, I found myself collecting little stories and oddities to tell her about when I saw her again, like stones that I slipped into my pockets.”“I have nothing else.” And there was no hesitation, no pause, as he stepped closer and said, “You have me.”He tipped my chin with his finger, turning my face toward him, and said it again.“Are you hurt, Tisaanah?”They bantered and teased a lot each other but somehow it was all tender, sweet and comforting. There was palpable tension and forced proximity between them which just made all the slow burn in the end worth it! This is the slowest slow burn so be prepared to be burn with them in the end ❤️‍🔥“I was no longer looking at a woman. I was looking at a fucking goddess. A goddess of death and vengeance and utter, indiscriminate destruction.”“Honestly? I thought he was breathtakingly functional too. He was the most breathtakingly functional thing I had ever seen.”And I loved how slowly their friendship developed into love. It was such a beautiful thing because they never forced their feelings on each other but were just going with the flow until they both realised they were in love. I love them so much 💘“I figured you should have something both beautiful and functional, like you.”He said it so quickly that it almost didn’t register.I whipped my head around to look at him. “Max,” I breathed, touching my heart with exaggerated awe,“you think I’m functional?” A dancing smile glinted in his eyes.“I think,” he said, “that you are breathtakingly functional.”✦ NuraFor me she is the most difficult character to understand and interpret. Like one minute she was cruel and cold and the other she had been so gentle with Ti. She had also helped Max a little before but I still don't like her work tactics and how she is working with Zeryth. Hope we get her redemption arc or something in the next books.✦ SammerinI loved his character so much and how he is caring and helpful to Ti and Max 🥺💘 he is one of the best character in this and Carissa you better not do anything to him or I'll bring chaos 🥰✦ Zeryth AldrisHe can die and rot in hell for all I care. Actually no I want Tisaanah to kill him rot his flesh the way he deserved for what he did to her and Max.✦ ReshayeWhat is it? A presence, a monter or something else?We got no answers but I have a feeling it is going to create much bigger problems in the future especially for Max considering its creepy obsession with him.The ending.No that was a lot and I was so scared for Max and Tisaanah what they had to do 😭 they still have wars to fight and so much more and the upcoming plot is going to be very interesting. I really hope so because Carissa left it such a perfect cliffhanger ending 👀“My name is Tisaanah. I am a free woman and yet still a slave. I am fragments of many things but a whole of only myself. I am a daughter of no worlds, and all worlds. And I am not done yet.”To bestie Krys💗 my best buddy, conspiracy and screaming partner 🫂 you are amazing and I loved reading this book with you sm and making all those murder plans 😌 I'm ready to kill them if you want to!!
