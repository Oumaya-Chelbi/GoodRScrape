Classic fantasy with a twist - can't wait to sink my teeth into the next book.Final Rating: 4.3/5🌕🌕🌕🌕🌗Malice is a fantasy saga that's both classic and yet refreshing. Sure, it's got the usual good vs. evil setup, and a whole heap of fantasy tropes (blacksmith's son, with a pet wolf, dark tidings on the horizon, coming of age etc. etc.). But here's the thing: it's the deep and complex characters that really make this story stand out. They bring something new to the table, lifting the story above the usual fantasy fare.Gwynne's world is a blend of the eerie and the captivating, packed with mysteries that unspool in such interesting ways. It's like taking a walk through a familiar forest and finding hidden paths you never knew existed. The characters, young and varied, give a fresh twist to those fantasy tropes we all know. And the way Gwynne plays with ideas of right and wrong, through characters who are both innocent and not-so-innocent, adds real meat to the story. Throw in a climatic ending and *boom* I'm already looking forward to the next one.Plot SummaryMalice is the first book in the epic fantasy series The Faithful and the Fallen. The story is set in the Banished Lands, a world filled with warring kingdoms, ancient prophecies, and magic. It revolves around the age-old conflict between good and evil. The central plot follows the lives of several key characters, primarily young Corban, a blacksmith's son. His life changes drastically as he is swept up in the growing conflict. Corban dreams of becoming a warrior and is unknowingly tied to an ancient prophecy foretelling the coming of a Bright Star & Black Sun. His life will never be the same.World Building: 4/5The Banished Lands, scarred by a distant God War, serves as a rich backdrop where an ancient prophecy foretells the return of this catastrophic conflict. This world, inhabited by a diverse cast including humans, giants, wolvens, draigs, and a knowledgeable talking crow, is meticulously crafted. Despite its reliance on familiar fantasy tropes, these elements are presented with a refreshing twist. Central to the tale are two prophesized champions, the Black Sun and the Bright Star, embodying the classic struggle between good and evil.“I shall stay and tell my tale, hope that it may serve some purpose, that eyes shall see it and learn, that the future will not repeat the mistakes of the past. That is my prayer, but what use is prayer to a god that has abandoned all things . . .”While I thoroughly enjoyed exploring this world, I wouldn't say that it blew me away. Although engaging, it weaves around some rather tropey ideas – tropes that I personally love, but which might feel familiar to seasoned readers of the genre. Gwynne's world-building is both expansive and intricate, yet it treads a path well-worn by fantasy predecessors, striking a balance between the comfort of the known and the allure of a new take on ancient myths.Story Telling: 4/5The story starts off with familiar fantasy vibes - think young teens with big responsibilities, like the classic village boy and the often-ignored youngest son. But Gwynne isn't just playing the same old tune. He takes these typical characters and adds his own twist, making them more intriguing and less predictable.For me, the book's pace was a bit on the slow side. It's heavily focused on character development, which is great for depth but means it takes a while to get into the thick of the action. That said, the mini-action scenes sprinkled throughout are a treat—really well done and add some needed excitement. When you reach the last part of the book, things really pick up, leading to a finale that's all high-stakes and intense action.“Both the brave man and the coward feel the same. The only difference between them is that the brave man faces his fear, does not run.”The ending ties up the storylines in a satisfying way, giving you a good sense of closure without any major cliffhangers. And it's emotionally impactful, too—some of my friends were even brought to tears by it. While the slow start wasn't entirely my cup of tea, I can see how it sets the stage for what promises to be an excellent plot moving forward. Gwynne has a knack for taking the familiar and spinning it into something both comfortable and refreshingly new, making Malice a unique blend in the fantasy genre.Characters: 5/5In "Malice" by John Gwynne, the slower pacing might detract a bit from the plot for some, but it's a boon for character development, which is executed brilliantly. The narrative unfolds through seven to eight points of view, all in third-person perspective. This diverse array of viewpoints allows readers to grow alongside the characters, experiencing their development organically over time rather than through rushed exposition or info-dumps.“Storm. I shall call her Storm.”Among the standout characters, Tull, Storm, and Envis particularly resonated with me. Tull's journey of bravery and Envis's descent into something more unhinged are just two examples of the rich, multi-dimensional character arcs Gwynne crafts. The book's strength lies in its ability to present a wide range of complicated personalities—some are immediately likable, while others remain shrouded in mystery.Characters like Nathair, Cywen, Maquin, and Camlin, among nearly 50 others, are skillfully portrayed, each leaving a lasting impression. Gwynne's talent for creating a connection between his characters and the readers is noteworthy. You'll find yourself becoming attached to these characters, and yes, it might hurt, as their journeys and fates are as engaging as they are emotionally impactful.Writing Style: 4.5/5John Gwynne's prose style that is both dynamic and richly textured, making it a standout in the fantasy genre. The action scenes are particularly notable; Gwynne writes these moments with a visceral intensity that is both thrilling and remarkably clear.“History is of value. If more of us took heed of the mistakes of the past, the future could be a different thing.”For me as I read I got strong whiffs of fantasy legends like David Gemmell, J.R.R. Tolkien, and especially Raymond E. Feist in Gwynne's writing. The detailed world he builds and the way he develops his plot and characters have that epic fantasy feel, reminiscent of Feist's style. That's about as high a compliment I can pay John.Enjoyment: 4/5This was a ride with both highs and lows. The ending absolutely nailed it for me, and the characters were a standout – they made the journey worthwhile. I also loved the unique twists throughout.My only real negative was the pacing - which as I've already mentioned was just a little too slow for me. Also, while I enjoyed the familiar tropes and the comfort they bring, the first half of the book did feel a bit too familiar, leaving me craving something a bit more groundbreaking. I do wonder if I'd read this book before Shadow of the Gods (Gwynne's more recent series) if would have liked this more - because that book just set up a lot of expectations in my head as to what his original series was going to be like.With all that said, what really speaks volumes is that I auto ordered the second book in the series after finishing this book. And so maybe my actions are speaking louder than my words.Final Rating: 4.3/5🌕🌕🌕🌕🌗My favourite books of 2023 in preferential order🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕:1.The Shadow of the Gods-(My Review)2.The Grace of Kings-(My Review)3.The Lies of Locke Lamora4.The Forgetting Moon-(My Review)5.The Justice of Kings-(My Review)6.Kings of the Wyld-(My Review)🌕🌕🌕🌕🌗:7.Morning Star-(My Review)8.The Blade Itself-(My Review)9.Red Seas Under Red Skies-(My Review)10.The Escape Artist: The Man Who Broke Out of Auschwitz to Warn the World11.Empire of the Vampire-(My Review)12.Assassin's Apprentice-(My Review)13.Malice-(My Review)14.Golden Son🌕🌕🌕🌕🌑:15.Leviathan Wakes-(My Review)16.The Winter King-(My Review)17.Gardens of the Moon-(My Review)🌕🌕🌕🌗🌑:18.Deadhouse Gates-(My Review)🌕🌕🌕🌑🌑:19.The Song of Achilles-(My Review)20.Red Sister-(My Review)🌕🌕🌑🌑🌑:21.Babel: An Arcane History-(My Review)
