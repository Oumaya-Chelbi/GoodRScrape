Owl babies is a story about 3 baby owls, Sarah, Percy and Bill. The three baby owl live with their mother in the hole of a tree. One day Sarah, Percy and Bill wake up and their mother is gone. She is nowhere to be seen. The owl babies start wondering where their mother has gone. The babies miss their mother very much, especially Bill. There is a memorable sentence said by Bill in the book ‘Where is my mummy?’ young children can relate to Bill’s anxiousness. Mother owl finally appears at the end of the story and she says to them they should know that she will always come back. This is a lovely story and can be used to help in transition when young children start nursery or school. The illustration in the book are very nice and Bills memorable sentence can encourage young children in joining in when reading the book to a child or group of children. This can be used in the early years foundation stage as the book of the week especially in the first week when children feel the separation from their parents and to ease their separation.My favourite character was Sarah as the eldest she made her siblings feel safe. ‘I think we should all sit on my branch.’ Sarah said. The owl babies sat on one branch so they will not be scared and feel safe. This book is suitable for 3-7 year of age. The book has sad moments, and happy moments that we can all relate to. It encourage us to think and this book can help children to think what they would do in Sarah, Percy and Bills situation. This book can be used for curriculum support especially PHSE (personal, social and health education).
