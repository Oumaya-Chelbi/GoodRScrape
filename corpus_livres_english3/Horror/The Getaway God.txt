So. This series is gloriouslydark, this series is beautifullyfished up. This series is overpopulated withdeliciously shrimped-up characterswho are most splendidly lacking in the moral compass department. Also, this series isviolence, blood, horror, gore, spilled innards, severed limbs, the works, YUM. Also,also, this series is brilliantliterary and cinema referencesheaven.

We're back inJimmy's an Irreverently Ruthless Smartass with a Bad Attitude Land(JaIRSwaBAL™)! Pure bliss and stuff. Not to mention that Jimmy got his groove back just in time to save the world from a bunch of ancient, pissed off, scrumptiously vengeful,slightly deranged gods.“Wisdom comes from knowledge. Knowledge begins with theories.” “I don’t want wisdom. I want a bazooka.”That's my boy! 🤩🤩A good thingthe Admiral's tender loving care got Jimmy back in tip-top shape, too.
