This is the way the world ends.Not with a bang but a whimper.-T. S. EliotFrom childhood's hour I have not beenAs others were - I have not seenAs others saw.-Edgar Allan Poe, "Alone"A fitting end to the year that just keeps on giving, ODD APOCALYPSE features surprise Guest StarsNikola Tesla and Alfred Hitchcock.Since it's release in 2012, I've read Odd Apocalypse every presidential election year 2012, 2016 and 2020.For several years I've said Odd Apocalypse was one of my favorite installments in the Odd Thomas series. After re-reading in 2020, I've changed my mind. I still need to re-read Deeply Odd and Saint Odd, but I'm confident in declaring my favorites in the series:1. Odd Interlude2. Brother Odd3. Odd Thomas2016 Thoughts:I had been looking forward to revisiting Roseland - I did enjoy the trip. This is one of my favorites in the Odd Thomas Series. The story is mysterious and interesting. In reading about "The Freaks", scenes from the 1970's futuristic cartoon, Wizards, flash through my mind. I like the inclusions of Tesla and Hitchcock. However, I still think Dean presents a better time travel novel inLightning.2012 Initial Reading:I finally read Odd Apocalypse as part of the Autumn 2012 Reading Challenge for the Dare to Dream Group. This title meets the task of reading a book with an orange/yellow cover as well as the task of reading a book with where at least of the characters is a ghost :-)I really wasn't sure I was gonna like this installment of the Odd adventures because it started out with too much repetition, but about the half-way point in the novel, the intriguing story had me.I love time travel so this brought back the good old days of Lightning and also From the Corner of His Eye, while also similar to a more recent work, 77 Shadow Street. On the subject of time travel, I highly recommend a recent film release called LOOPER, and at the same time highly recommend the 1980's classic BACK TO THE FUTURE :-)Odd Apocalypse touched on some ideas from the earlier Odd books. I like how the dark room from the first book was mentioned. I also like the scientific element which was reminiscent of Brother Odd. Enjoyed the information on Tesla and I thought the ending was beautiful.Favorite Passages:Bareback on the Friesian, the barefoot beauty wore white silk and white lace and wild red ribbons of blood both on her gown and in her long blond hair, thought I could see no wound.______I looked into a sky where the sun had not quite yet gone down, as if some celestial timekeeper had wound the cosmic clock backward a few minutes.That impossibility was exceeded by another. Yellow from horizon to horizon, without the grace of a single cloud, the heavens were ribboned with what appeared to be high-altitude rivers of smoke or soot. Gray currents streaked through with black.______When the air shimmered and the yellow light was replaced by red, I stumbled, fell, and rolled onto my back. Raising my hands to ward off the ravenous horde, I found the sky familiar and nothing winging through it except a par of shore birds in the distance.______After the woman, the horse, and the yellow sky, I didn't think I would sleep that night. Lying awake in low lamplight, I found my thoughts following morbid paths.______"Please don't let anyone kill me by shoving an angry lizard down my throat."_______Duty doesn't need to call; it only needs to whisper. And if you heed the call, no matter what happens, you have no need for regret._______In the wild fields around the periphery of the estate, through which I had rambled on other days, snowy woodrush and ribbon grass and feathertop thrived among the majestic California live oaks that seemed to have been planted in cryptic but harmonious patterns._______Like any mentally healthy citizen, I am overcome by the urge to strangle a mime when I happen upon one in full performance, but a mime who's already dead is unmoved by that threat.Turning in a full circle, in seeming solitude, I nevertheless said, "Hello?"The lone voice that answered was a cricket that had escaped the predatory frogs._______Between birth and burial, we find ourselves in a comedy of mysteries._______"'Nice weather for February,' What's that supposed to mean?" Before I could reply, he said, "What the" - imagine an ugly word for copulation - "is that supposed to mean, butthead?"_______"You think I'm dumb enough to eat crap on toast?""No, sir. Not on toast."_______"Hurts like a sonofabitch.""What're you doing for it?""Nothing you can do for a sonofabitch canker. Sonofabitch has to heal itself.""That's not a canker. It's a cold sore.""Everybody says it's a canker.""Cankers are inside the mouth. They look different. How long have you had it?""Been six days. Sonofabitch makes me want to scream sometimes."_______Full of crooked dark-yellow teeth, his cold-sore grin was as appealing as a possum run down by an eighteen-wheeler._______"Ass," he declared, managing to hiss and growl the word at the same time, while thundering it out loud enough to rattle the stable windows. "Keister means ass."_______We make so many of our own troubles, from mere mishaps to disasters, by dwelling on the possibility of them until the possible becomes inevitable.. . . .Quick now, here, now, always, if we are in a condition of complete simplicity (as the poet said), hope and trust will more reliably keep a man afloat, while fear is more likely to sink him._______I sensed that not only the land sloped form east to west; within the grounds of this walled estate, reality also was tilted from the norm and was being steadily levered to an ever more severe angle, until Roseland would abruptly slide to ruin, reason would slither down to madness, and everyone here would cascade to death.The sun was hardly risen, but already time was running out._______Stocky, barrel-chested, thick-necked, antisocial, Sempiterno would have been a classic strong-and-silent type if he could have shut up for a minute._______No one knows better than I that reality is more complex that the five senses can discern. Our world with all its mysteries is a moon to another bigger and more mysterious world unseen, orbiting so close to the larger sphere that perhaps sometimes the curve of one passes through the curve of the other with no damage to either, but with strange effects.Not daring to take the time to look back again, I ran toward the horse and rider._______The vaulted ceiling of the cathedral of oaks was reminiscent of church windows, although there was more leading than stained glass, more darkness than light, in the sun-gold and leaf-green patterns that might have been an abstract depiction of Eden._______The golden morning sunshine twinkling in the gaps between the leaves became yellow-orange as its angle of origin shifted east to west._______All in white and immense, like an array of taut mainsails and topsails and staysails, Chef Shilshom seemed about to glide away wherever the wind might carry him. But the kitchen, of course, was windless, and the chef was intent upon adding to a pile of eyes on the cutting board beside the sink, where he was blinding several pounds of potatoes before peeling them._______"Their faces melt off their skulls. And their skulls turn black when the air touches them, and all their bones black. And then the black blows away like soot, there isn't anything left of them."_______I walked among the crowded oaks, where the shade was so deep that no underbrush or grass could grow. Gold coins of sunshine were scattered on the dark woodland floor, and on that bare and stoneless soil my footsteps were as nearly silent as those of a sneak thief._______From the crest of the hill, the land in general descended. But the ground fell and rose and fell again in a series of waves, like a golden sea frozen in one moment but the swells remained formidable and the troughs were still deep._______"I have seen you - "I turned, but found no one." - where you have not yet been," he whispered.When I turned again, I saw a man with a mustache standing at the farther end of this service aisle that led between spheres and flywheels. Tall and gaunt, he wore a dark suit that hung loosely on his bony frame. By his appearance and solemn attitude, he reminded me of an undertaker.Louder than before, he said, "I depend on you," and he crossed the end of the room from this aisle to the next, disappearing behind the spheres._______Sometimes it seems that I am dreaming when I am in fact awake, my reality as unreal as the lands I walk in sleep._______Instead of grasping the hand that I reflexively held out toward him, the man passed through me, as if he were a ghost. For the brief moment that we occupied the same space, an electrical current seemed to surge form the core of my body to every extremity, neither painful nor thrilling, but making me acutely aware of the neural pathways by which I felt pain and pleasure, hot and cold, smooth and rough, sound and sight and smell and taste. The routes taken by every nerve in my flesh were as clear in my mind's eye as were the highways on any map I'd ever read. No ghost could ever have such an effect._______"I'm not afraid of you.""Maybe not," I said, "but I'm afraid of me."That was too true. With the excuse that I am a defender of the innocent, I have done things that curl in my memory like worms in an infected apple. When I sleep, they squirm and wriggle forth to crawl the dreams from which I wake in a sweat._______For most people, reality is as simple as a painting, hanging before them in their frame of reference, understood and unquestioned. I live with the awareness that under the apparent painting are countless layers, previous scenes that have been painted over. Any physicist well-schooled in quantum mechanics or chaos theory knows that reality is a beast of mysterious dimensions and potentials and that the more we learn, the more we realize how much we don't know._______An apocalypse is a revelation, and this was an apocalyptic sky, in the sense that it revealed what humankind, by its arrogance and reckless certitude, would bring down upon itself._______These acres were an island of the irrational in the sea of everyday reality._______"I saw you and said, 'That crazy little sonofabitch is going to run into a bunch of sonofabitch porkers,' and you sure enough did.""I thought they were called freaks.""Maybe here they're freaks, but there we call 'em porkers, though I call 'em porkers here, there, it doesn't matter to me.""Consistency is a good quality in a man."________"I didn't go to any sonofabitch college, you know. An I don't hang out with a bunch of candy-ass techno geeks. Whatever the nano swarms were, the sonofbitches ate themselves in the end."_______"He was standing naked in the driveway, as pale as a ghost in the moonlight. We saw him with his rifle just a moment too late. I never saw him kill my mother that time, because he shot and killed me first."_______I thought "let us go to the chromosphere" sounded like it should have been an old David Bowie song. Even in moments of peril, my mind takes curious detours._______Every corner was a danger, every doorway a threat, the silence pregnant with peril._______"Haunted by the future."_______"Great Caesar's ghost! I am a carbon-copy Tesla, rolled through the platen of time's typewriter! Spun off in one of the first experiments with the chronoshphere, ricocheting through the years, belonging nowhere, effective nowhere, useless!"_______"Give me baby," the thing said.. . . ."Give me baby," it repeated.. . . ."We kill," it said. "We eat baby."_______The best part of a Mr. Goodbar is not the wrapper, is it? No, and the best part of a Coke is not the can. On those nights when you lie awake, either man or boy, wondering about yourself, peeling away one layer of oddness after another, you should remember and always be grateful that the woefully imperfect person that you are, will all your contradictions and unworthy desires, is not the best of you, any more than the wrapper is the best part of a Mr. Goodbar.
