A bit of a let down from book 1. In book 1 we see hard men trying to kill each other. Here the survivors have returned home but they have given the werewolf "elders" cause to kill them. The MCs, however, aren't certain the elders will attempt to kill them and are too busy lying to themselves and each other to take that threat seriously and act intelligently. One of the MCs, Morris, is at least paranoid enough to be suspicious of were, Bailey, that shows up unannounced to hunt on his land. Bailey is himself an elder and so is much stronger than Morris. Morris escapes, barely, and, in a fluke, Bailey gets his head blown completely off. Werewolves don't die from decapitation but a werewolf that regenerates a head becomes a mindless killing machine, stronger even than typical werewolves. Therefore werewolf "wardens" are called in from all over Canada to stop Bailey.The problem with this book is that Kirk and Morris come across as stupidly indecisive. Kirk is for much of this book an out right wuss. The author makes it abundantly clear to the reader that the elders want the MCs dead but why the MCs refuse to understand this is never convincingly related.Bottom line: Good book that could have been great if the author would have made his main characters a bit more intelligence and decisive.
