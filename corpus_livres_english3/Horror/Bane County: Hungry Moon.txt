I have very rarely enjoyed a series this much!What a fascinating take on the Werewolf genre I read books 3 and 4 twice well i just started my second read of the 4th book. The first started out with horror in mind not so much science and such with even a hint of the supernatural but as the series progressed so many genre's got mixed in and what a wild bag and the author actually does something very rare he made it all work. He makes Stephen King look like a 4th grade writer he's just that good. When reading the 3rd book for the second time there where things written in there that scared me to death. Without giving away spoilers if anyone who reads this review and has read the books especially the 3rd one if hearing tap tap tap on a window doesn't scare the shite out of you nothing will! I literally threw my tablet down and had to recatch my breath because the tension the author created in that scene was terrifying only a few books has ever done that too me. I highly suggest people spread the word on these book's. Read them yourselves and get the word out this author deserves a life of luxury and should already be a top seller. Good job to the author please write another one and another and another. Show the Hamilton's and King's of the world this is what scary stories really look like. One complaint I do have there's no audiobooks to go with these. Hope someday that will change would love to hear a good reader read these books on audio also one last thing would love to know more about these Werewolves and what there drive and perspective is. They are an ancient species in these books and highly intelligent what would there history be? I love imagination
