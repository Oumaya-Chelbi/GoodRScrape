Star Rating:—>4.5 Stars🌟⭐️🌟⭐️ plus .5 stars![ARC Buddy read with my bbyDarceyyyyy]ThisBRILLIANT novelwasABSOLUTELY HORRIFYING, diverselyQUEER AS F*CK, & oh hell, did I freaking LOVE it!!![Honestly, I had quite the struggle to just… write this review, because I just feel that no words can express just how amazing it was, &I mean that with all of my pan & neurodiverse/ neurodivergent (though I prefer the term neurodiverse because it has more positive connotations ! ) heart.]“In what world was their God ever a benevolent one?”This novel boasts such incredible own-voices autism spectrum rep, trans rep, gender non-conforming rep,all sortsof LGBTQIA+ rep, and yet is also everything a horror novelshouldbe at the same time. It was so very terrifying, but I COULD NOT turn away!The MC, Benji, a trans, gay boy, is just my precious son! I would do anything for him. His character arc was FANTASTIC.Considering he has a presence put inside his body, by a neo-fascist, extremist & warped Christian CULT, called Seraph—a six winged, clawed, flesh-deteriorating beast thought to be holy, that is supposed to bring about the end of times—but never stops fighting to LIVE, is so very inspiring… which despite all of the beyond awful, hellish things (when I say hellish,I mean HELLISH; the erm, terrifying AF images portrayed through the author’s vivid prose are something that probably will haunt me forever, in the best way possible, if that makes sense?) that this kid has to go through bring me to a theme that stands out in this novel—perseverance.When Benji escapes the confines of the cult, he thinks it is only a matter of time… he thinks that he is doomed. I mean can you blame him? He was Made by this disgusting cult to potentially finish off the rest of the survivors after the the “Flood” wiped the earth of the “sinners” (aka, frankly, mass genocide), The Flood is a body mutating illness, that either immediately, painfully kills you, or turns people into walking horrific versions of themselves that are called “Graces,” by, and used by, the cult. Along with the human, sadistic, cult member death squads, who go by the name “Angels” (PLS, Angels my freakin’ ass! Ugh. They APPALLED me & made me SICK, to put it lightly, which I know was the point, but hell—it was like a punch to the GUT to bear witness to their atrocities, fiction or not, because these sorts of things HAVE and DO happen in our world. Maybe not on this scale, but does that REALLY matter? NO. They had me, no joke, experiencing tremors from my anxiety over this!) these Graces are forced to hunt survivors of the Flood & kill anyone in their path.Given that he is Seraph, a great ending doesn’t seem possible for Benji, butfor me to root for him, to LOVE him, & never doubt his beautiful character arc, SO much… this is, plain & simple, the mark of an EXTRAORDINARY debut author.Everything changes when Benji finds the local LBGTQ+ center for teens, known as the ALC.“We’re not going to hurt you. The ALC was built to help queer teenagers, and that’s what it’s always done. It’s just that the specifics have changed in the past few years.”Everything,everything, changes. Benji for the first time in his life feels like he BELONGS. Which is such a pivotal point in the novel, because it increases his self-perseverance and he finds true friendship, & a found family, plus a bit of non-conforming romance—for the first time in his life, he has people that love him & he loves back, immensely, to protect, and he will, at ANY cost.Another protagonist, Nick, a gay teen on the autism spectrum also has stolen my heart, & his autism rep was INCREDIBLE. He always carries beaded lizards that he makes when he is alone to help relieve his, for lack of a better term, discomfort in social situations, and again for lack of a better term, symptoms, like needing repetitive behavior (his amazing, precious beaded lizards being one of many) to soothe & help him just get through LIFE, damn it! My heart goes out to him, fully & wholly. By no means does this make him weak, or “other,” he handles himself with (TRUE) grace, but also keeps his guard up so he can be the rock the ALC needs—their no shit taken, hardened, but just, & so very kind at his core, leader. Nick’s character arc was also extraordinary… getting the rare treasure of his POV had me in TEARS. I may not be on the autism spectrum, but I AM neurodiverse, with ADHD, multiple anxiety disorders, OCD, and Bipolar II (depressive bipolar), so I felt for Nick in my very SOUL. Because this is an own-voices novel, the author absolutely amazed me with his strength to write based upon his struggles (don’t get me wrong, the autism spectrum is vast & wide, and I have no idea what HIS personal struggles are, but still… just… I am in awe of Andrew Joseph White, either way). Nick & Benji form quite a connection, and it is wonderful to see. 🥰“In exchange, he gives me the trans bead lizard he finished last night. I cradle it in my hands, admiring the pale pink, baby blue, and gentle white. All I can manage is “thank you,” even though I want to say,This is the first time I’ve gotten to hold something with my colors.”🏳️‍⚧️ALL of the members of the ALC were so absolutely ALIVE, withall sorts of LGBTQIA+ rep, and such a wide range of beautiful pronounsbut thisNEVER, EVER, felt like preaching, or forced, it felt REAL—which is EXTRAORDINARY; an author who can represent so many amazing LGBTQIA+ characters, plus autism spectrum representation that felt so, so full of life, like it just jumped off of the page of this apocalyptic novel, & into the world we live in is just so, so RARE.When I started this… I didn’t know that it was aTRUE HORRORnovel, but BOY,DID I FIND OUT. I look forward to reading more from this author! No author has ever scared me like this, AND I LOVED IT, HOLY HELL (pun intended 😂), did I adore it— I love horror because it scares the living hell (I need to stop with the puns, BUT I CAN’T, hahah) out of me, which I LOVE because it makes my TRUE anxiety fade away, & gives me a respite from it.🥺**WARNING**:This book is NOT for the weak of heart! Body horror, cult horror, apocalyptic horror, gore horror… first book to ever truly, wholly SCARE ME,TERRIFY THE HELL OUT OF ME(again, pun intended 😉),from beginning to end, &you have no idea how hard that is—I do not scare easily ! Especially when it comes to books, the author has to be a MASTER of horror so AGAIN a shit out to White is TOTALLY INCREDIBLE🫣! Mad respect to them, truly. This is a MASSIVE feat—MASSIVE!!!.**Also: Look out for triggers that include abusive relationships, deadnaming, & misgendering. And… probably, definitely, NOT a book for serious Christians.**AN ENORMOUSThank Youto NetGalley, Peachtree Teen, & the to the author,Andrew Joseph White, for the e-ARC!
