My copy is an advance uncorrected proof, part of the Cemetery Dance Early Readers Club 5.0The Kellar family has a chance to start over when Jenna inherits her father's house. It seems like the perfect answer. But before they've even fully unpacked, things start going awry.Tension builds as some kids are noticed playing on the vine covered swing set out back. Different family members see these kids and even hear them, but each feels afraid to admit what they have seen. Because what they have seen should not or could not be. One of the boys, seen by Jenna, leads her to believe he might be her recently dead son. Of course, Josh only gets a cameo at the beginning.And then Miles is seeing a fat man coming out of his bedroom floor late at night filled with malevolent intent.This family has enough to deal with just starting over after their son, Josh, dies. Soon, they are learning the difference between psychics, mediums, and clairvoyants. And we all get to see what happens when fakes are faced with a real problem beyond their capabilities. I loved the final scene of the defrocked Catholic priest.This story reads well, the characters are all very believable, and the writing is cinematic. This is a really good ghost story; one which has the bad guy, in death, pay for his evils in life.As I do with every ARC, here are some problems I noted:On page 265, after the scene break, it says: "Come follow us to the house, Father," Lily said. That can't be Lily saying that, she's not in the scene. It has to be Mavis or Jenna.After the next scene break on page 265, it says: Across form her... That should be from, not form. (I do this all the time and spell-check won't catch it) This same word bumble happens again on page 290 where it says: "Okay," he called form the dining room.I still haven't figure out the second to last sentence on page 299. It's as if two sentences were jammed together.Thanks Ray, for a great ghost story.
