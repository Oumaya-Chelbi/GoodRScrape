I have read a few books from this author, and she seems to carry through with a "woman-is-superior" theme throughout them all. Rilsin is by far the most overkill and cliche of this standpoint. The story itself is very interesting, complete with twists and political intrigue. But Rilsin is so annoying! Little do-good-ing, swashbuckling, prize-winning, number one hottie, justice-girl. It's a little difficult to swallow. I was waiting for her to do something wrong--because people usually do...Online cliche character test results were off the charts.But I really liked the subtle tension that grew into a competition with Sithli, as well as the growth that we saw in Sifuat. Sifuat turned out to be my favorite character. I found his flaws lovable, since he was the only realistic and believable character in the book. Everyone else was just too starchy and perfect...like braid-boy...what was his name? Sofa? (Sola...) Solar Panels. There you go. He probably invents those in book two.
