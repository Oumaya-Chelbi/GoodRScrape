Re-read rating: Brilliant!!! *** 5 ****** 4.65 ***A Buddy Read with my Fantasy Fanatics @ BB&B! Because we love ALL FANTASY!!!I need to start with one of the best quotes from the book, which I find eternally true and very current!!!"... “Do not seek to find hope among your leaders. They are the repositories of poison. Their interest in you extends only so far as their ability to control you. From you, they seek duty and obedience, and they will ply you with the language of stirring faith. They seek followers, and woe to those who question, or voice challenge. ‘Civilization after civilization, it is the same. The world falls to tyranny with a whisper. The frightened are ever keen to bow to a perceived necessity, in the belief that necessity forces conformity, and conformity a certain stability. In a world shaped into conformity, dissidents stand out, are easily branded and dealt with. There is no multitude of perspectives, no dialogue. The victim assumes the face of the tyrant, self-righteous and intransigent, and wars breed like vermin. And people die.”...Amen!!!In the end of the previous book, the Tiste Edur Trull Sengar decided to tell his story to his undead companion. This book is that story.Midnight Tides connected with me on an intellectual level much more than the previous couple of tomes. I had a visceral emotional reaction to "The Chain of Dogs", which was book 2, I really enjoyed the other three books, but this one spoke to my current state of disillusionment with the world around me very cerebrally. We would like to be able to compare the fictional and fantastical empires of Malazan and Lethar to long dead empires of ours, but Lethar's problems were very closely related to our Western powers of today. The systematic destruction of the middle class with the growth of both groups of the very rich and the very poor, is becoming the perfect growing field for all that the majority of us find deplorable and unthinkable, but it starts insidiously creeping up on civilization and it cyclically destroys it from within... Rich and poor with no vast middle class for stabilization, is a revolution waiting to happen. And we once again never learn from history's lessons.... But the best way to make the point of this book I will let my very favorite character of the whole Malazan series up to now, Tehol Beddict, lay it out the way only he could!!! :"... “As they walked, Tehol spoke. ‘…the assumption is the foundation stone of Letherii society, perhaps all societies the world over. The notion of inequity, my friends. For from inequity derives the concept of value, whether measured by money or the countless other means of gauging human worth. Simply put, there resides in all of us the unchallenged belief that the poor and the starving are in some way deserving of their fate. In other words, there will always be poor people. A truism to grant structure to the continual task of comparison, the establishment through observation of not our mutual similarities, but our essential differences. ‘I know what you’re thinking, to which I have no choice but to challenge you both. Like this. Imagine walking down this street, doling out coins by the thousands. Until everyone here is in possession of vast wealth. A solution? No, you say, because among these suddenly rich folk there will be perhaps a majority who will prove wasteful, profligate and foolish, and before long they will be poor once again. Besides, if wealth were distributed in such a fashion, the coins themselves would lose all value—they would cease being useful. And without such utility, the entire social structure we love so dearly would collapse. ‘Ah, but to that I say, so what? There are other ways of measuring self-worth. To which you both heatedly reply: with no value applicable to labor, all sense of worth vanishes! And in answer to that I simply smile and shake my head. Labor and its product become the negotiable commodities. But wait, you object, then value sneaks in after all! Because a man who makes bricks cannot be equated with, say, a man who paints portraits. Material is inherently value-laden, on the basis of our need to assert comparison—but ah, was I not challenging the very assumption that one must proceed with such intricate structures of value? ‘And so you ask, what’s your point, Tehol? To which I reply with a shrug. Did I say my discourse was a valuable means of using this time? I did not. No, you assumed it was. Thus proving my point!’ ... "If the Malazan Empire is the mirror of The Roman, then the Letherii society mirrors the Byzantine Empire in its most decadent. Rome and its military structure, together with their laws, engineering, and religious Pantheon, were a power which conquered, took everything, but also propped-up the peoples it enfolded into their empire. There were taxes in money and people, but overall, they worked under a set of rules which were pretty reasonable (this is speaking as a person of today, I am not sure the people at the time perceived it the same). Byzantium drowned under the wight of its arrogance and greed. Their sense of "destiny" and belief in supremacy made them entitled and incapable of correct objectivity when it came to their military power, their enemies and the internal decay that was eroding the core of their culture. It is sad, because they had gone complaisant, soft and fat, but the arts, literature, music and intellectual culture were flourishing. It would take centuries for them to reach the same levels, until which humanity in that region had lost most of its soul..."... “Progress... is the belief from which emerge notions of destiny. The Letherii believe in destiny - their own. They are deserving of all things, born of their avowed virtues... Destiny wounds us all and we Letherii wear the scars with pride... We have a talent for disguising greed under a cloak of freedom. As for past acts of depravity, we prefer to ignore those. Progress, after all, means to look ever forward, and whatever we have trampled in our wake is best forgotten’ ... "Everything in Lether exists only as far as its value goes. Gold can see a person and his family live well, or the lack of it can turn a family for generations to come into "indebted" = slaves. The ruling King, his Queen and their child, the Prince, are secure in the military and magical power of their kingdom, and see themselves as the fated rebirth of the foretold Lether Emperor and kin. The ruling class and the army leaders are so sure in their military prowess, that they start wars in order to gain more slaves and ultimately gold, with not a care for the people they conqueror. The poor are just a fother for the front-lines, to absorb the losses and perform the clean-up and manual labor. They are just throw-away lives, not real... Unless you are that poor person or their family... Udinaas is one of those indebted, who has been captured by the Edur and is a slave to them at the moment. Even as slaves, the Letherii continue segregating among themselves according to their status before being captured..."... “Udinaas well understood his own kind. To the Letherii, gold was all that mattered. Gold and its possession defined their entire world. Power, status, self-worth and respect—all were commodities that could be purchased by coin. Indeed, debt bound the entire kingdom, defining every relationship, the motivation casting the shadow of every act, every decision.’ ... "The Tiste Edur tribes live in the shadows of legends which paint them as the victims of betrayal, while denying them the greatness they see themselves as deserving. However, the distinct and warring Tiste Edur tribes have now united under the Warlock King and are preparing to claim their destiny at the head of the Letherii Empire. Theirs is a tribal culture where coins have value only as decoration of the body of the fallen warriors. They have trade and slaves from the people they conquer, seeing no point in gold as a commodity. Being barbaric in the eyes of Lether, they are vastly underestimated and the inevitable clash, which the Letherii provoke, is bound to be much more contested than the refined and arrogant royals and army expect. After all, the Warlock King has made some very powerful and angry new allies...So, we have very traditional clashes of cultures, but the book is much more than just that. It is layer upon layer of stories, human fates, political intrigues, economic plots for collapse of the money market, and most of all, we have the various g-ds starting to really show their hand in manipulating the pawns of their choosing. Old, Elder, New, not-completely ascended and forgotten G-DS are starting to steer and the hapless humans, as well as other races and creatures, they use and abuse, in most cases are left bereft of a choice or having say in any of their participation on the game board of the all-powerful. Some of those G-DS arose some sympathy in me, but most of them are petty and selfish, and I wanted to smack or destroy them, if possible both! However, the mortals, or mostly mortals, we get to meet in this book for the first time, were endlessly entertaining, however pathetic, non-to-bright, undead, powerful or genius they might have been. On the Edur side I was very partial to Trull Sengar, whom we met in House of Chains. However, both of his brothers were very memorable, each in their own way, as well. On the Lether side, well, the list is longer, but I am completely in love with Tehol Beddict, the middle of another three brothers, who lives as a failed destitute businessman, with his faithful man-servant Bugg, who is much more than he appears. His philosophical musings made this book a pleasure for me to read. Seren Pedac was also interesting, although her path is very difficult to read about... Great characters who delivered comic relief are the undead Shurq Elalle and her amazing makeover, the three ladies business partners of Tehol, their bodyguard, the complete opposite of Karsa in everything but physical appearance, Ublala Pung, and all the members of the Rat Catcher Guild!!!! I was particularly partial to every moment the Guild's "inspector" was on page:):):):) This multitude of the character ensemble made the massive book fun to read and easy to follow. The story was very linear and flowed in a manner not typical for the previous books. However, it was paced perfectly and I was very, very pleased with it. As always, I would highly recommend this series to all those who love Epic and Military Fantasy and do not expect romance or rainbows to come with it. The author once again shows the ugly face of war and the crime that it perpetuates on the individual as well as humanity as a whole. Brilliant!!!"... ‘Destiny is a lie. Destiny is justification for atrocity. It is the means by which murderers armour themselves against reprimand. It is a word intended to stand in place of ethics, denying all moral context.’ ... "Now I wish you All Happy reading and may you always find what you need in the pages of a Good Book!!!
