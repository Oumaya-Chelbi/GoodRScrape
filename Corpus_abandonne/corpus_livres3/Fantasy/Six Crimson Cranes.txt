Her life turns upside down when her stepmother curses her and her brothers. She is separated from her family, struggles alone in an unknown place, and is now determined to find her brothers. She has become selfless throughout the months, and her character development is something I came to love in this book. I wished I could give her a tight hug for all the pain she had to go through🥺🫂❤️‍🩹“Emuri’en, be kind. Let us survive the trials that await us. Don’t knot our threads together, only to sever them.”Takkan~lord of Iro, betrothed to Shiori, a thorough gentleman, a man of his words and down-to-earth person. He is an artist, and a storyteller (he might have written many stories in form of letters to Shiori which she never read🤭) He never gave up on finding Shiori🤧 He protects Lina aka Shiori without knowing she is the princess. I love him so much and can't wait to see him in the next book😩💘“I would tell you stories from dawn to dusk if it meant filling your eyes with happiness.”“I’m bound to you first. I always have been.”“I would not have you be alone, Lina, not in your joys or your sorrows. I would wish your strand knotted to mine, always.”Raikama~aka'the Nameless Queen', is the most misunderstood villain of this book. She is the type where you hate in the beginning due to the things she does to Shiori and her brothers, but in the end, you can't help but love her. She deserved better😭💔 I would be lying if I said I didn't cry towards the end of the book.“Your curiosity will be the doom of you one day, little one.”“I wanted to give you memories of your mother. Memories that would make you smile, even when you came to despise me.”“You are my daughter, not of my blood, but of my heart.”“Learn from my mistakes, and learn from my joys. Surround yourself with those who’ll love you always, through your mistakes and your faults. Make a family that will find you more beautiful every day, even when your hair is white with age. Be the light that makes someone’s lantern shine.”Kiki~the paper bird who was given life by Shiori through magic, is her guide/companion/friend bird. I wish I had magic to get a kiki too🤧 She was brutally honest every time, makes the funniest remarks, gives wise advice even tho it's just a paper bird, and protects Shiori. If it wasn't for kiki's friendship, I don't think Shiori would have survived those months. All the more why she is the most favorite character for me from this book😍“Generous of Radish Boy. I’m starting to like him already.”“Suit yourself. All I’m saying is, he doesn’t seem quite like the barbarian you pictured.”“Do you want me to poke her eyes out for you?”“When you die, I die. If you’re not afraid, I won’t be either. I’ll stay with you to the end, Shiori.”“Ignorant brute, I’d pay good gold to see his face when you tell him who you really are.”Side characters I loved the most: Kiki (the wisest paperbird😇), Megari (the cutest😍, takkan's little sister), and Seryu (the jealous dragon🐉🤭)Side characters I loathed the most: Hasege and Zairena💀🔪❥ 𝓢𝓸𝓶𝓮 𝓸𝓯 𝓶𝔂 𝓯𝓪𝓿 𝓶𝓸𝓶𝓮𝓷𝓽𝓼 𝓸𝓯 𝓢𝓱𝓲𝓸𝓻𝓲𝓣𝓪𝓴𝓴𝓪𝓷💞~“I owe you my life, from now on, Lina is my guest here, free to come and go as she pleases.”“I’m glad I finally met you, Shiori’anma.”“I wish you would speak to me, sometimes, the way you move your lips, I swear that you can. Even if I’m wrong, I wish I could at least see your eyes.”“Just know that I care about you, Lina. I couldn’t be there for Shiori, but I will be there—for you. Whether you need me or not.”“You almost got yourself killed, rushing into the fire like that.”“I would do it again without hesitation. To hear your voice. To finally see your eyes.”“What are you doing?”“What does it look like? I’m coming with you.”“I don’t—”“You can’t expect to steal my horse and take off without me. Besides, I have a story I think you may like.”“If you think that there is anything you could say to dissuade me from coming with you, then you are sorely mistaken.”“But the demons—”“Would have to rip me from your side. I’m afraid you are stuck with me, Shiori, even if you don’t ever wish to marry me. I pledge to protect you.”“You know, you’re even bolder when you can speak, Princess Shiori.”“I have many months to make up for.”“The odds of death were high, but not assured.”“You courageous fool.”“If that’s what you call me now, rather than ‘that barbarian lord of the third rank’ —then it was well worth it.”“My brothers aren’t going to put you in the dungeon for giving me a hug,”“I know, I only worry that I won’t want to let you go.”ˏˋ°•*⁀➷・❥・𝒫𝓇𝑒𝓋𝒾𝑒𝓌・❥・ˏˋ°•*⁀➷⛄02/10/24My thoughts are too mixed up, RTC soon💌it's a crime there is no crane emoji⛄02/02/24Not me doing another br now🙈 I don't think I'll finish my current read anytime soon🤸🏻‍♀️Doing this br with ma prettiestlila🥰💘lila said it's good, so I'm trusting her, because if we suffer, we suffer together🤭
