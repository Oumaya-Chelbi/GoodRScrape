Now I realise that Dan Santat'sThe Adventures of Beekle: The Unimaginary Friendwon the Caldecott Medal, and that judging from the for the most part very positive reviews, many readers do seem to really really love the illustrations (that they are considered expressive, imaginative and even rather magical). However and all that having been said, I for one have not at ALL enjoyed either the illustrations (their Caldecott Medal designation notwithstanding) or the accompanying text, the presented narrative ofThe Adventures of Beekle: The Unimaginary Friend. Sorry, but for my own aesthetics, Dan Santat's illustrations, while indeed bright and imaginative, are simply not even remotely visually pleasing to and for my eyes, with especially the main character, with especially Beekle, reminding me rather painfully of a marshmallow like Pokemon type of creature (and why he has to be wearing that crown on his head, I will never really understand). And furthermore, as someone who has always had issues with contrast, the fact that Beekle is almost entirely white in colour has made him rather massively difficult to even adequately see and detect at times (for especially in those scenes ofThe Adventures of Beekle: The Unimaginary Friendwhere the surroundings are washed-out, are whitish or of a pale yellow type of hue, Beekle often simply seems to just blend into the environment, necessitating squinting on my part, even if I am wearing glasses, and causing an annoying bit of eye strain for me).And as to the actual story, as to Dan Santat's accompanying text (for he functions as both author and illustrator here), while the concept ofThe Adventures of Beekle: The Unimaginary Friend, while the general idea of an imaginary friend type going travelling, going out to find a child to be its companion is indeed novel and an interesting twist (and while I have to a point actually enjoyed the ending ofThe Adventures of Beekle: The Unimaginary Friend, with Alice arriving and noticing Beekle, and both of them slowly becoming friends and companions), I cannot say that I have found either the general set-up or the specifics of how Dan Santat moves the plot along all that engrossing or in any way engaging. For while story presented inThe Adventures of Beekle: The Unimaginary Friendis sweet enough, I guess, for me personally, there certainly has in no manner been any kind of a "wow" or a "yes" factor, just a bit of a tedious yawn and even, and sadly, also a personal happiness thatThe Adventures of Beekle: The Unimaginary Friendwas short and only took about five minutes maximum to read (because the illustrations simply are not my cup of proverbial tea by any stretch of the imagination, and the accompanying printed words, the narrative, the storyline of Beekle looking for a friend and finally finding Alice, while indeed tender and loving, are for all intents and purposes really not special enough to mask or to overcome my aesthetic annoyances and frustrations with the pictorial images, with how Beekle in particular has been depicted).
