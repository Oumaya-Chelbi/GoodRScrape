"I took the Moon for a walk last night,It followed behind like a still summer kite, 🪁🌕🪁I carried my owen light just in casethe Moon got scared and hide it's face,But it peeked through cloudthat were fragile as lace,when I took the Moon for a walk,Hand holding hand through the starry night sky, when I took the Moon for a walk,we danced cross the bridge where the smooth waters flow,The Moon was above and the Moon was below,And bright in between themI echoed their glow,when I took the Moon for a walk,Then as we turned back,the Moon kept me in sight,It followed me home and stayed there all night,And thanked me by sharing it's sweet sleepy light,when I took the Moon for a walk"A wonderful poetic picture book with warm illustrations,Shiny and bright as the moon, sweet as the moonlight, warm as the beautiful friendship between us and the Moon, I shared with the Moon a walk, friendship, love and light in this book, I loved it so much,A million stars and a millon hearts for the book and the Moon~ 💙💙🌌🌕🌌💙💙كتاب مصور شعري رائع برسومات دافئة، لامع كالقمر، حلو كضوء القمر، دافئ كالصداقة الجميلة بيننا وبين القمر،تشاركت مع القمر التمشية والصداقة والحب والضوء في هذا الكتاب ،أحببته للغاية،مليون نجمة ومليون قلب للكتاب وللقمر ~💙💙🌌🌕🌌💙💙23.07.2021
