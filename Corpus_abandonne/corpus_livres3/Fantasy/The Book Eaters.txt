“There is no happy ending to this story.”Book Eaterspresents itself asa mishmash of literary genres, blending elements of horror, fantasy, dystopia, parallel worlds, and feminist and anti-patriarchal themes—in short, a concoction crafted to cater to popular trends. However, my experience with the book left me profoundly disenchanted, to the extent that sleep eluded me until I addressed my grievances through this review. The sheer amalgamation of these popular tropes failed to resonate with me, and the result left me feeling frustrated and dissatisfied. I can recall feeling a similar level of intense disappointment only once before, upon completingThe Binding.Problem number one: the ideaThe fundamental flaw ofThe Book Eaterslies in itsintriguing yet underdeveloped premise. Paradoxically, it is about the only book about devouring books I read, where books have no inherent added value but are - on some subversive level - a liability, instead.The central concept ofbook-eating feels arbitrary and disconnected from the narrative, lacking any meaningful exploration or explanation within the story. This is particularly disappointing considering that the premise holds significant potential and is likely the primary draw for many readers. You need to be warned that the execution of this excellent idea falls flat.I cannot explain how frustrating it is to encountersuch a promising concept squandered by a lack of depth and coherence: The author introduces the idea of people consuming booksand mindswithout bothering to explain the origins, mechanisms, or implications of such behaviour. Instead of leveraging this fantastical element to explore themes of magic or science, societal consequences, or psychological intricacies,the main plotline involving book-eating often feels contrived and unconvincing, failing to establish a solid rationale for this phenomenon. At times, it even borders on the absurd; instead of understanding how people became bookeaters, the magic or science behind why they exist, how is it that they are faster and can see in the dark, why they seclude themselves from society in ghotic mansions and treat women in a suicidal way endangering the whole species’ survival, we learn that chalk paper tastes best with ketchup. Seriously?!The missed opportunities to imbue the story with substance and coherence and the failure to capitalise on the innovative premise ofThe Book Eatersresults in a narrative that feels shallow and unfulfilling.Problem number two: character developmentThe lack of development in the central concept ofThe Book Eatersextends to its characters, resulting in a cast that feels shallow and unconvincing. Devon, the main protagonist, emerges as particularly problematic, characterised bynaivety, denseness, and a startling one-dimensionality. Her identity seems restricted to her role as a mother, albeit a notably dysfunctional one. Thissingular personality trait her characterisation rests upon fails to lend her any depth or complexity, rendering her portrayal disappointingly flat.The portrayal of Devon’s fugitive existence exacerbates the narrative’s shortcomings,veering into grotesquenesswith its unnecessarily bleak and gruesome depiction. Many of thechallenges she faces could have been easily circumvented with even a modicum of intelligence, yet the narrative fails to provide her with the necessary agency or resourcefulness. Basic strategies such as forging fake IDs or navigating international borders as a an undocumented refugee are beyond her grasp, highlightinga frustrating lack of logic and coherencein the storytelling.Themodern setting only exacerbates these issues, as the depiction of familial dynamics and language usage feels jarringly out of place, evoking a Victorian rather than a contemporary reality. The inclusion of props such as motorcycles, video games, vodka, and mobile phones only serves to highlight the narrative’slack of cohesion and believability, further undermining its already tenuous foundation of the bookunderscoring the overall lack of attention to detail and internal consistency.Beyond Devon,the supporting characters fare no better, existing as little more than cardboard cutouts devoid of substance or significance. Even Devon’s son, ostensibly a pivotal figure in her life, serves merely as a plot convenience rather than an individual. Moreover, the interactions between characters feel stilted and artificial, characterised byflat dialogue and monotonous exchanges that fail to capture any sense of authenticity or emotional resonance(in plain English this means bad writing). The absence of meaningful character development further undermines the story’s credibility, which left me without anyone to truly connect with or relate to.Problem number three: the taleBeyond the surface-level exploration of patriarchal oppression,the narrative fails to offer any meaningful depth or complexity. Its predictability is evident in its overall plot trajectory, which adheres to a formulaic and uninspired course. Despite its seemingly solid construction,the story quickly grows derivative and tiresome—chapter in, chapter out—as it relies heavily on repetitive slogans and fails to introduce any genuine intrigue or originality. Also, please note, a paragraph about how a woman finds another woman attractive is not enough to make a queer identity book. What defines the identity of the MC, what drives her and her actions, is the fact that she is a mother, the fact that she also happened to be a lesbian is of secondary if not tentiary importance for the whole story!). In fact, the narrative’s banal portrayal of Christianity asa convenient scapegoat serves as a fitting encapsulation of its overall lack of depth and nuance.The story’s only redeeming quality would is the fact that is it told backward, slowly unraveling the secrets of its uninspired past. But alas, even that does not salvage its irredeemable mediocrity.Stay away.
