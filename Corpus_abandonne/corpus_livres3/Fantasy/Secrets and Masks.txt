If you think otherwise, get off my review.a few notes from me1: This book was a rollercoaster, to say the least. Special shoutout to my irl friends for listening to me rant about this for HOURS, whether in person or over text, shoutout to humna for enduring updates after every chapter and my late night pinterest texts about it, and thank you for everyone on here for suffering through countless status updates about this. If you missed any of them and want to see my thought train evolution, its all there for you to backread (its super chaotic and like the 5 stages of grief in there). BUTTT it has all my thoughts.2: I know so many of you aren’t fans of Draco, or Dramione, but that’s okay, you dont have to bei will convert you eventually. Anyways…Humna, Almas, and Jazzy…you girls get it. And that’s all that matters to me <3.3: okay so theres this rlly long quote and yall are so lucky i love you cuz i wouldn’t type this out for anyone else. Anyways the point is idk where else to put it SO here:You’re not cancer, Granger, you were an antidote. My heart was dead, it’d been drowning in darkness and hatred and revenge for years and then you gave my life meaning, you made me laugh and smile and showed me what it meant to be alive. You brought me back to life and you made me want to live. I don’t want to know what I would have become if you hadn’t pulled me back.🫧𓇼𓏲rest of review✩‧₊˚🎐·˚ ༘₊· ͟͟͞͞꒰➳ Harry Potter Fanfiction·˚ ༘₊· ͟͟͞͞꒰➳ what to expect + content warnings➳ 3rd person past tense➳dual pov w/ some extra POVs in other places➳ heart-wrenching emotional torture➳ Dramione fic➳ Death eater Draco➳ Wartime➳ blood + gore➳ enemies to lovers (REAL enemies to lovers)➳ betrayal➳ Blaise x Astoria➳ Ron x Romilda (barf)˚ ༘₊· ͟͟͞͞꒰➳ personal reading stats (# of crash outs, high lights, etc)➳ Crash out numbers: ~413 crash outs➳ Stats in apple books:╰┈➤Bookmark #’s:274Yellow Highlights (plot):150Green Highlights (writing style):37Blue Highlights (characters):114Pink Highlights (romance):84Purple Highlights (moments + miscellaneous):131Underlines (quotes):130Notes:75·˚ ༘₊· ͟͟͞͞꒰➳ ∞ stars·˚ ༘₊· ͟͟͞͞꒰➳ 3.5/5 (spice rating)·˚ ༘₊· ͟͟͞͞꒰➳ ❀❀❀/5 (fluff rating)「 ✦Secrets & Masks✦ 」(noun) the most perfect fanfiction to existAlready Gone↻ ◁ II ▷ ↺1:35 ───ㅇ───── 3:47❝And I want you to know/You couldn’t have loved me better.❞☁️ . . . ⇢ ˗ˏˋ overall thoughts╰┈➤ ❝He could do this forever, dance with her for eternity while the rest of the world turned to ash around them, and he would never be bored.❞It’s perfect. I can’t put into words how much I love this fic. I have to shout out Humna and Almas again, because you were so, SO right about this, and every single tear was worth it. I know that my review will never, ever be able to do this book justice, but I will try my damn best.˚˖𓍢ִ໋🌷͙֒✧˚.🎀༘⋆ writing style╰┈➤ ❝Can a person go mad with grief?❞I thought when I read Binding 13 that that would be the best writing I have ever read. And I definitely never thought that my #1 writing style would get knocked down by a fanfiction. But THIS…yall I can’t. I can’t even. Binding 13 made me shed a few tears. But Secrets and Masks had me bawling like a BABY (and I very rarely cry over books). Everything Emerald_Slytherin writes is SO visceral, filled with emotion and color and perfect descriptions. The world came to an end for me because of this fic and the way it’s written, and there is nothing I wouldn’t trade for just ten minutes of being able to read it for the first time again.♡₊˚ 🦢・₊ ♪ ✧ plot╰┈➤ ❝You deserve to rest now.❞Yall the way this plot had me hooked from the verybeginninnglike I’m so serious. And the pacing for it was just…aslkdjglasd;ghe fucking PERFECTION like there are no words except that the plot was perfectperfectperfect. That’s it, thats the review. It’s perfect.˖◛⁺⑅♡main romance♡⑅⁺◛˖╰┈➤ ❝I think it could even melt the ice around your cold little heart, if you let her.❞I could go on and on and on about how Dramione is perfect in general, y’all know that by now. But ENEMIES TO LOVERS Dramione when it's written like THIS?? Yall my heart can’t survive it. It’s so stupidly perfect it’s not fair why do they get to be so perfect for each other 😭. And their foreplay being fighting don’t get me wrong I’d never want to do that IRL but for some reason that is so hot and holy shit when they said I love you for the first time I think my heart cracked open a little bit and their snuggle sessions later and THE END OF THE BOOK and THE WAY HES SO OBVIOUSLY IN LOVE WITH HER I CANT DO IT. and the way they talked about ‘in another life’ AND THEY GOT IT OHMYGODDD୭ 🧷 ✧ ˚. ᵎᵎ 🎀 friendships/other relationships╰┈➤ ❝Now do you understand why i have to do the things I do?! It’s for them!❞Blaise and Astoria??SCREAMING they’re so perfect for each other. I have ALWAYS been a Blaise girly more than a Theo girly (sorry Humns) and let me tell you when I saw the way he treats Astoria, like she hung the fuckingmoon? I was gone. Dead. Deceased. If my Draco is taken in this life, I’ll gladly have Blaise as my second choice.Draco, Hermione, and Narcissa (the dragon):Their bonds are so perfect. The way Narcissa hates everyone except Draco and then Hermione shows up and its like oh hello there ITS SO GOOD ALKJDSG:GHEOIWSGDLK➶-͙˚ ༘✶ characters╰┈➤ ❝No matter how long he studied her, no matter how much he thought he knew her, she always managed to surprise him.❞Main Characters 「 ✦Hermione Granger✦ 」╰┈➤ ❝They used to say that you couldn’t possibly be a Mudblood, because you were too powerful! Too good at killing. So fucking talented at murdering our soldiers it was like you were born to do it!❞I’ve said it before, and I will say it again: Hermione Granger is the ONLY character that I can say with certainty that, no matter how she is written, I will love her, and relate to her 110% percent, even before I actually read the fic. She has always been the character I see myself in the most, and probably always will be (unless there’s a character out there that yall are hiding from me). And the hermione in this fic? She is a badass queen of badassery. She is SO fucking cool, like i literally cant describe how in awe of her i was reading this. I want to be her so bad holy moly.·˚ ༘₊·꒰➳: ̗̀➛relatability?[■■■■■■■■■■] 100%·˚ ༘₊·꒰➳: ̗̀➛how much i liked them11/10Main Characters 「 ✦Draco Malfoy✦ 」╰┈➤ ❝What makes you think there was anything good in me, to begin with?❞I could go on and on about how much I love him, but I feel like it might get a little redundant. Acc, yk what, i dont care! Yall can listen to me yap about my husband because he is the loml and ALKGDS:JGALGJEOWIG say what you will i love him SOOO much. Death Eater Draco, School Years Draco, Auror Draco, it doesn’t matter, I will LOVE him. That being said…I do tend to have a soft spot for Death Eater Draco.

She is my life. My very reason for existing. If you do anything, anything at all that may cause her harm or risk exposing her condition, will kill you.❞➸❝He may be a demon by name, but I refuse to believe that a man who tore off his wings, only to use them as a shield to protect his family, could ever truly be soulless.❞➸❝Hermione couldn’t decide which they were more afraid of. The dragon, or the Demon.❞➸❝Hermione didn’t feel any of it, because her heart was already broken.❞➸❝Fuck - why did it have to be you?

But remember, if administered correctly, fear can also be the most dangerous weapon on earth.❞➸❝[...] it’s a lot harder to fantasize about stabbing you in the heart when I can see the reason why it’s so broken.❞➸❝You don’t know what it feels like to love someone so much that you can’t fucking breathe without them.❞➸❝I don’t know what to think anymore. I don’t know what’s real anymore.❞➸❝Don’t hide from me.❞➸❝I fucking hate that you’ve revived something in me that I thought I’d buried a long, long time ago. I hate you for it, Granger, I really, really do.❞➸❝And you’re absolutely stunning when you’re trying to kill me.❞➸❝[...]when I saw what Zacharias Smith had done to you, when I saw what those Black Masks were doing to you, nothing else mattered to me! Do you hear me? Nothing! Else!”[...]”All I could think about was killing them! Killing all of them! Killing everyone who’d ever even thought about hurting you.❞➸❝And although she’d never admit it if he asked her, she’d never felt safer.❞➸❝I don’t just see the horns when I look at you,” Hermione breathed. “They’re still there. I can still see them, but they’re not all I see anymore.❞➸❝[...] she knew that she meant something to him.

If this was how she could spend her last days on earth, then she could die happy.❞➸❝Granger,” she said, and he smirked at her in that way that made her heart flutter. “Do you think my love for you is so fragile that something as simple as death could keep me from you?❞➸❝And if I could do all that for a man I despised, what do you think I would do to protect her?❞➸❝No,” she whispered. “Not in this life, but maybe we’ll get luckier in the next one.❞➸❝I’d quite happily let another thousand or two die if it bought us another week together.❞➸❝I love you Draco, more than anything.” and there was a finality in her words that made his already breaking heart shatter into a million pieces.❞➸❝There is not a thing I wouldn’t do to keep you safe.❞➸❝We have all the time in the world.
