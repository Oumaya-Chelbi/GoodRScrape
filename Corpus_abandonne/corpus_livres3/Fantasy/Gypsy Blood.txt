Violet wants to find out who killed her mother, but her plans are thrown out the window when she meets three of her wealthiest new clients and realizes that they somehow know she is a Portocale gypsy despite her giving them a false name. She also comes to realize that when she changed her will to give everything she owned and her business to Violet, her mother made sure she would move into a town full of monsters, and Violet can’t figure out why her mother would knowingly put her into such danger.Portocale gypsies are an old gypsy family, with special blood that allows them to see ghosts. They have also been hunted for generations now, but the “why” is still unclear to me. All we know is that there is a cult after Portocale gypsies, and they made it their life goal to kill them all.Some part of the magic or secret code the gypsies adhere to is a little vague, and you have to just push through and hope that eventually it will make sense.There is a big deal around Portocale oranges for some reason, as well as gifts and being indebted to someone, but it is never explained clearly how that works. While I don’t like it when authors info-dump us randomly, I would still have enjoyed a little more information here. The same goes for gypsy pride... Is it a magical power? Something all gypsies have, but can lose over time if they are not careful? I am still not sure I fully understand.While I love the ideas in this book, and there is potential for an intriguing series to develop, this book was not that amazing or impressive.I loved the last 15%, but the rest of the book was a little bland. It felt like all Violet did was run around in town, trying to figure out how to be a gypsy, and what secrets the men were hiding.“I don’t exactly feel safe,” the monster girl says to the monster hunter, who has no idea she’s a monster.Violet is made of a lot of contradictions.She seems naïve, clueless, and helpless, yet she has badass mysterious superpowers that make her almost invincible. I am not the most confident in her survival skills, but hopefully, she will become more interesting and it will feel less like she’s being dragged around by everyone in the next books. Also, I am not a fan of the whole “heroine not knowing anything about her world or heritage” trope so it didn’t help since this book is mostly about Violet figuring out how little she knows about the world and what being a Portocale gypsy means.It’s been a while since anything has captured our interest. Most things have grown redundant or boring over the centuries, but a Portocale with no fucking clue who we are? Seemingly has no clue about herself, although she certainly knows she’s a Portocale?It’s the makings of my newest obsession.Violet is the new Portocale gypsy in town, and she attracts the attention of all the alpha monsters around.Vance Val Helsing, the monster hunter feels compelled to protect her, while never really explaining anything to her, but he’s refined and very charismatic so we forgive him. Damian Morpheus remains a dark and sexy mystery for most of the book, and he’s intrigued with Violet partly because of who she is and what she hides, but also because he sees how the other alphas are attracted to her and sees it as a game. Emit is the alpha werewolf, and it’s clear that he is intrigued by Violet too, but also not sure if she is genuine or not in her ignorance of everything related to the Portocale’s way.Violet also develops a strong bond with Ace, a ghost who has been stalking the three alphas for years and takes pleasure in helping Violet manipulate them into giving her the answers she seeks.Even though the three alphas and the ghost all seem to be attracted to or obsessed with Violet and she finds them all hot and sexy, I would not qualify what is between them as romance.It’s more lust and the small, tiny beginning of something more. I know it will end up being a reverse harem, but I have a feeling that it will be a very slow burn, and I am fine with that! For now, there is sexual tension, and the potential for some good chemistry, and I hope the development of the romance will be well-paced and not too rushed.“I didn’t come here to talk about you. I came to talk about me,” I remind him. “Why do I give a damn about you? I’d much rather talk about me,” he volleys, narrowing his eyes.I am a sucker for angsty betrayals, and I absolutely adore the plot twist at 90%.I did not see it coming, and I might have screeched a little bit when I read that part. The author did a wonderful job with this character and this betrayal, because I loved the traitor before and was hoping that Violet could find a way to end up with him, and now I am rooting for him even more, even though he betrayed Violet and ended up being slightly psychotic.Anna is Violet’s best friend, and she is an amazing comedic relief throughout the book.Ghosts don’t “live” forever, the closer they get to their final death, the more delusional and out of touch with reality they get. Anna is getting closer and closer to this final death, making her a pathological liar who often doesn’t even know that she is lying. She was hilarious at the most random moments, and knowing that the guys could see her, but had to pretend they didn’t made it all even funnier especially since Anna seems to be obsessed with the fact that she can’t have sex anymore, and is trying to push Violet to be wilder so she could live vicariously through her.On a side note, the audiobook might not be the best choice for this book. The female narrator is fine, but some of the male characters, Emit in particular had a strong accent and were very hard to understand at times. The male narrator also didn’t differentiate the voices of Vance, Emit, and Damian that much, so it was a little confusing at times.Follow me on Instagram🙂
