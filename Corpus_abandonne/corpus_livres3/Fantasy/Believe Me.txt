✨aaron warner and juliette ferrars invented the definition of soulmatism✨i don’t even know where to start, i’m an emotional mess but the feeling of euphoria that came over me whilst reading believe me is simply unmatched. i went through a stampede of emotions, i was literally crying, smiling, and laughing through the whole novella and sometimes all at the same time. it feels like an end of an era and i’m so not ready to let go! i could feel warnette’s love seeping through the pages which made me pause reading so many times because it was just overwhemingly beautiful and adorable. i fell head over heels in love with these characters and the world several years ago and it still has such a massive hold over me. it has always been one of my favourite series’ and will continue to be! it’s been such a wild journey and i’m so freaking sad it’s finished! but honestly, this novella was truly a glorious and beautiful way to end a mind blowing series. tahereh knew how dissatisfied we were with imagine me and then delivered perfection with believe me!“I don’t care, love. I don’t care about any of it. I just want you. I want you to be my family.”i feel as though i have underestimated my love for warnette, everything i felt for them before was nothing compared to my absolute love for them now.“You all insult him over and over again and he just takes it—he doesn’t even say anything—and somehow you’ve convinced yourselves it’s okay. Why? He’s a real, flesh-and-blood person. Why don’t you care? Why don’t you think he has feelings? What the hell is wrong with you?”i was shouting along with juliette when she told the others to stop bullying our man!! We witnessed a vulnerable warner and it was gut wrenching but i loved seeing that side of him!“I take a deep, shaky breath. I don’t know what to do with my arms, or my legs. They feel prickly suddenly; all pins and needles. I want to tear them off my body.I’m staring at the ground when I say, “Have you changed your mind? About marrying me?”it was truly heartbreaking to see warner second guessing everything, been uncertain and just feeling like he’s unworthy of everything, especially juliette’s love. This is what i was waiting for. I wanted to delve into his mind since we didn’t have that opportunity in imagine me. We got to be in his head as he felt more vulnerable than he ever has before and it was beautiful. there’s so much growth to these characters and it just brings tears to my eyes when i think about everything they went through! warner and juliette were destined to be soul mates and this novella reinforced that. warner has the biggest heart and i wish he was able to see himself in her eyes, his devotion to her is awe-inspiring.“I would sleep on the cold floor of our hospital room for the rest of my life if it meant staying by Ella’s side. I can forgo quiet. I can compartmentalize my need for space. My desire for privacy.But to lose her—”warner in disbelief that the surprise wedding was planned in advance was so sweet because he couldn’t fathom why everyone would do this for him. I love that man i really do“I shake my head. “It wasn’t about me. My experience doesn’t matter—”“Of course it does. It matters to me. You don’t get to be the only one who worries about the person you love. I get to do that, too,” she says, breaking away to better look me in the eye. “You spend so much time thinking about what’s best for me. You’re always worried about my safety and my happiness and the things I might need. Why don’t I get to do that for you? Why don’t I get to think about your happiness?”“I am happy, love,” I say quietly. “You make me happy.”also, WARNETTE SMUT???? IT WAS SO UNEXPECTED BUT SO FUCKING GOOD. I DIDN’T KNOW HOW MUCH I NEEDED THAT BEFORE READING IT🥵“Please,” she says, still touching me. “Aaron—”I sink down, without warning, onto my knees. Ella steps back, confused for all of a second before her eyes widen with understanding.“Come here, love.”and they really would’ve had sex in graveyard if it wasn’t for kenji😂this novella had such entertaining scenes especially the scenes between kenji, winston and warner. also, when warner said to kenji if he’s coming to stand beside him at the wedding. WHEN I TELL YOU I CRIED LIKE A LITTLE BABY. These two came such a long way and i don’t care what anyone says they’re best friends!! (obviously juliette is #1 bestie to both guys lol)I’m trying, but I can’t stop laughing.“Huh,” says Winston quietly. “I didn’t even know his face could do that.”“Yeah,” Kenji says. “It’s super weird the first time you see it.”“I can’t look away. I’m trying to look away and I can’t. It’s like if a baby was born with a full set of teeth.”“Yes! Exactly. It’s exactly like that!”“But nice, too.”“Yeah.” Kenji sighs. “Nice, too.”“Hey, did you know he had dimples? I didn’t know he had dimples.”- warner having a favourite flower shouldn’t even be surprising at this point😂🥰and WE GOT TO SEE WARNER WITH A DOG!!!“Does he have a name?” she’d asked.“He is a dog,” I’d said, frowning as I looked up. “You may call him a dog.”that man is so funny, he’s so fucking adorable!“Her faint, almost undetectable note of jealousy— possessiveness—only cements my smile in place.”- warner being happy over juliette’s jealousy was actually the cutest- warner ready to kill kenji for ruining juliette’s dress-warner being more obsessed than juliette over her having the perfect wedding dress.. my fashion king only wants the best and im here for it- the realisation that kenjinazeera will be his neighbours😂“A dangerous heat builds behind my eyes and I force myself to fight it back, to remain calm, but when she sees me, she smiles—and I nearly lose the fight.“I told you it was a nice dress,” Kenji whispers.“Kenji.”“Yes?”“Thank you,” I say, still staring at Ella. “For everything.”i knew he’d be close to crying when he saw juliette walking down the aisle. and this novella confirmed that kenji and warner are besties🥺they explicitly and implicitly promised to love and be there for each other through their actions and words throughout the novella. They anticipated each other’s needs. We may have not got the traditional wedding vows we wanted but the declarations of their love were tied to everything that they did for one another and that in itself was all the vows I needed and it was beautiful. they both are so fucking pure and deserve everything and more!! As we know, warner and juliette would always find themselves back to each other. No matter how many times their memories were erased, they always were drawn back together and fall in love every single time. For juliette, Aaron Warner Anderson is the only emotional through line in her life that ever made sense. He's the only constant. The only steady, reliable heartbeat she’s ever had. and for warner, she is his whole damn world.of course I needed more, I wanted warnette honeymoon and babies but I can only hope that tahereh has plans to write another novella in a few years, and I’ll be waiting!! i have been bursting at the seams with excitement ever since this novella was announced and i am so deliriously happy with it🤍as juliette once said, i feel like i’ve been split open and stuffed with sunshine.✨✨WARNETTE NOVELLA CONFIRMED!!!!✨✨AND IT'S FROM WARNER'S POV!! who else is crying with me??? can't wait to see warner referring to juliette as his wife all the time, it's going to make my heart sing🦋😭"Believe me is the devastatingly romantic fifth novella in the New York Times and USA Today bestselling SHATTER ME series, chronicling the events after IMAGINE ME, the explosive sixth novel."I AM ON CLOUD FUCKING NINE!! aaron warner, the most precious and softest man to ever exist is back! he is my soulmate, my religion, my reason for breathing, my lifeline, my love and i can't believe he's back! tahereh has given us the most incredible gift🥳🥳🥳we get to finally witness kenji walking juliette down the aisle, tears streaming down warner's face but has the biggest smile as he watches the love of his entire life running towards him in a beautiful wedding gown and a kenji struggling to keep up with the glowing bride!! warnette wedding vows. warner bullying kenji. warner and a dog. unhinged warner. soft warner. kenji and nazeera. warner, james and kenji content. warnette baby. warnette dates. warnette cuddles. warnette fluff. just all things domestic and warnette. the loves of my life!💖NOVEMBER 16th, 2021.
