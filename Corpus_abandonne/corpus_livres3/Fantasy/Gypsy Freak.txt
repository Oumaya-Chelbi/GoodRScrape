Objectively, this series is not that amazing so far. Violet is a rather bland main character (although she seems to be starting to grow a spine a little more), and we don’t know much about the love interests to truly grow attached to them. Violet seems to be completely clueless about whatever is going on around her, and while I find myself annoyed with all this vagueness and lack of information in the world-building, I am intrigued and entertained enough to want to continue with this series…I wanted more angst.The ending of the first book was surprising, shocking, and promised angst after the betrayal Violet suffered. Yet, we quickly find out that she is made to forget that betrayal, and when she finally remembers it, she gets over it pretty easily. She is still pissed at Arion, but the angst and intense emotions I was hoping for were absent.‘’Sometimes I can’t tell if I’m really dumb or just too damn stupid to live. Then I remember I can’t die, so option number one it is.’’Violet is not the best, or most interesting main character so far, but she is becoming more and more interesting, so there is hope yet for her.She has the potential to be a real badass, considering she cannot die, but she still feels like a lost puppy running around and trying to understand what is happening, and being unable to resist the guys at times (while being able to resist and ignore them at others). That is not entirely her fault, the guys are not being forthcoming at all, but I am getting tired of her (and me) being left in the dark, and this feeling that all Violet does is look for answers she cannot find.It's annoying not to know what’s going on, and to have no idea of the direction this series is heading toward.I am ready for her to learn everything there is to know about the curse and the gypsy ways she seems to know nothing about, and for her to be able to focus on something else, like the death of her mother, the fact that ghosts are dying around her because of something her mother did, or the fact that so many people are trying to kill her.He narrows his eyes. “If you think she’s deliberately fucking with us, why are you in a hurry to get over there?”I grin. “Because I positively love that in a woman.”I like the guys, but at the same time, I don’t care for them all that much.It’s weird. I like them as characters, and they all have their vibe and quirks, but I don’t feel that much chemistry between Violet and them. They are obsessed with her for some reason (probably her Portocale blood because it sure as hell is not her dance skills or interesting personality), and she finds them all hot and can’t seem to stay away from them, but there is no true chemistry! I get that this is a slow burn, and I have no problem with that, but I want more sexual tension, more banter, deeper connections, more everything to get on board with the idea of Violet ending in a RH with these 4 guys. Emit mostly feels annoyed because Violet does not seem to care about him, Vance keeps her at arm’s length because she’s a Portocale, Damien ignores her because he’s paranoid, and Arion is still playing his games and while he clearly would not be opposed to having his way with her, I can’t say that I feel sizzling heat between them.There was a lack of comedic relief due to Anna's absence for most of the book.I know she was over-the-top ridiculous in the first book, but I loved her constant commentary so much! I missed it a lot in this book. I do hope there will be more banter of sass between the different characters in the next book to make up for the lack of obscene comments from our favorite ghost.On a side note, this cover is horrendous. I don’t know what’s happening with this series' covers, but thankfully, Gypsy Blood’s cover looked better, or I would never have given it a try.1.Gypsy Blood⭐⭐⭐.5Follow me on Instagram🙂
