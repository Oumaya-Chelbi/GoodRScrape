I think there’s nobody out there that haven't heard aboutConan the Cimmerian."The Barbarian."The essential one, and if not the first one, then the most recognizable and influential character that shaped the genre of epic fantasy.When it comes to books he is a talking, fighting, drinking, brooding grim-dark, sword and sorcery sub-genres trope.Especially in past 20 years when we have witnessed not just revival but full on blossoming of such genres where anti-heroes are taking the spotlight again.Usually the story goes like this: North.(It’s always north in these books.)Mountains, tundra and snow.It’s only natural that such hostile environment breeds harsh society. Or stalls the progress of it. So we’re left with nomads and tribes - barbarians. Brave stoics honorable in their own way.Driven by their own moral codes; mystery, spiritualism and connection with the nature their mantra.On the opposite side of the spectrum, in the south, usually around some delta rivers, civilization strives. Wealth and stupidity as per usual goes hand in hand.Boredom and greed, we mustn’t forget them. And, of course, they have a vast army.Hence the expansion of this decadency to the remote northern mountains.And everyone is so… villainous and despicable in the south. So evil.They clash. Civilizations, cultures, nay, worlds collide. Atrocities are committed. And when all is finally done, there’s none alive from those northern barbarian villages.Except this one fisherman who wanted naught but to care in peace for his family and his ducklings.But, they murdered his family. They killed and ate his ducklings.And he will have his revenge.He wages war. Alone. Against the south. Against the entire world.And of course, since, us readers, are coming from such civilized society, and since something in that remoteness of the north is strange and new, almost exotic to us - and since we are deeply moved and hurt by death of ducklings - we demand justice.We wish for this troubled, heroic, and already fan-favourite fisherman bent on vengeance nothing but success.Oh, just how many books with this similar beginning or entire premise have we all read?So, it’s no wonder that Erikson, who already decided to spit in the face of the genre with his series, within the series itself, in writing his own Conan the Barbarian in character ofKarsa Orlong,tried something new with this northern barbarian trope.Tried. Because, despite the intention and despite the effort, I’m not sure that he actually succeeded.“How far from our own sensibilities can we be pushed before it’s too much?”Erikson tried to address this northern barbarian hero trope and in his book show us, as realistically as possible within the genre, and more importantly within the human nature, how in this barbaric warrior-based society that arrogantly and with sense of superiority looks down on everyone else, and how from certain point of view, there’s nothing heroic nor worthy of romanticizing about them.It’s actually quite uncomfortable watching them.And in first 200 pages of this book, which is a separate book itself where we go back in time and witness(pun intended)Karsa’s origins and travel with him until he himself, and we readers, catch up with main events, I think that Erikson managed to show us what he intended.In those 200 pages we are following Karsa who rapes, murders his foes and endlessly belittles his friends.There are so many shocking and jaw-droppings in disbelief that at some point you have to ask yourself:why am I doing this to myself;and of Erikson:why are you making me following journey of this piece of sh*t?But, by the end of this part of his story you understand the intention.The problem kicks in when that story ends and we are left with 800 more pages of the novel.Karsa is extremely powerful being, who in his alienated society knew nothing of dealing with problems without usage of that vast power.“The poison itself had coursed deep within him, and the only answer he gave – when he gave one at all – was of violence, often misdirected, a lashing out on all sides.”In seeing this estranged integrity and sense of honour he upholds, we are left with appalling atrocities committed along the way.Until there comes a time where he lifts himself up from this one-dimensionality of a character and we witness the moment where his power won’t be enough.Where he knows of defeat. Then struggles. Desperation. And finally weakness.Where he finally seem like a person and not as a walking and talking proclamation.But with each layer of Karsa’s character we get, and with each moment he fittingly for the story kills a villainous character that annoyed us in this book, he gets sympathy from us, a form of recognition and sort of a pardon for his devious acts at the beginning of the book.And with each sympathy, pardon and cheer he gets from us, he deviates from the intention of dismissing that heroic, romanticized northern barbarian trope – and in becoming this anti-hero(but hero nonetheless),fan-favourite, we love and care about – he becomes that same fantasy trope he was created to battle against.Now, don't get me wrong people, I do find interesting(parts of)his story, but overall, I cannot like him nor love him, due to the fact how he was introduced to us.For example, inKameron Hurley'sWorldbreaker Sagaseries, there's a character calledZezili Hasaria.Main antagonist of that series.I find her story interesting and her character's progression amazing, but I will never say that I like her or love her. She's a rapist and a genocidal maniac.Same as Karsa here.So, whenever I see Karsa I remember that he raped a woman beside her daughter and then proceeded into raping the entire village.And then he continued with stupidly killing everyone on his path, and the only reason why he stopped doing that wasbecause others overpowered him and chained him.And the reason why there has been change in his perspective and perception of other, weaker species, wasn't when he was all-powerful so that at some point he simply said:"OK, this isn't the way"- but that change came to him when he waspowerless;when he was unable to inflict even more damage on others.Which, to me, is cowardly, weakly and most importantly - boring.Karsa, to me, is the weakest link Malazan Book of the Fallen series has to offer.To get back to Zezili Hasaria, the reason why I find her more interesting than Karsa, despite both having appalling similarities, is because Zezili Hasaria had a change of heart when she was the strongest, when she was most powerful.She recognized that nobody should have that much of a power, so she decided to do something about it. She didn't had to. But she did.That, to me, is interesting.Enough of Karsa. As I've mentioned, there's 800 pages of this novel yet to unravel.And they do not disappoint.After we finish introducing ourselves with Karsa, we get back to that much dreaded for readers after the second bookDeadhouse Gates-Seven CitiesandRaraku Desert.Link to enlargeLink to enlargeStory.In the city ofAren,upon which walls we have seen the end of that endless suffering of refugees running throughChain of DogswhileColtain's Wickansand Malazan army battled to protect them until they were all perished, reinforcements arrive.Green recruits lead by equally inexperienced AdjunctTavore Paran,sister toGanoesandFelisin,now have to retrace the steps of their fallen comrades and go deep into Raraku desert, to battle army that waits and hopefully end the rebellion.In the desert however, leader of the uprising is Tavore's younger sister, Felisin, possessed by aWhirlwind Goddess,growing more powerful and equally insecure as her sister and their final duel approaches.Kalam, ApsalarandCrocus,now namedCutter,get recruited and sent to their missions byCotillion,patron God of the assassins, to defend a certain Throne, and with it the humanity.Many new faces, especially within the Malazan Army, as interesting asBridgeburners(because I'll be damned if I won't defend and point at sheer awesomeness ofGelser, StormyandTruth),that fittingly replaces their absence.And there is Adjunct Tavore herself.One of my favourite characters of the series. Close battle withSilchas Ruinfor that No 1 spot.Usually, when a writer decides to withholds character's point of view and grant us a direct access to their train of thoughts, he comes up with a solution that we nonetheless stand on our tiptoes when they enter a room, simply awestruck.(khm khm,Anomander Rake)But to manage that with a character that so far we knew only that she sold her sister to protect her from death, character that from the moment she enters the fray is welcomed with grudge, doubted because of lack of her experience even by her army and chain of command, is something that I really didn't think I would ever say about.She doesn't have a bad-ass sword, she doesn't weer into a dragon, she doesn't have any magical ability - but the power nonetheless oozes out of her.Because she is capable.And for me it's always pleasure following such strong characters.Many have expressed their frustration because of the way the book ended.It was Shakespearean. This whole series is Shakespearean.When we take that in consideration, I say that ending was only fitting.Prose.Reading that first quarter of the book, it felt to me like this whole section of Karsa's story was written earlier, perhaps maybe at the same time whenGardens of the Moon,or maybe it was meant to be implemented in Deadhouse Gates.I thought maybe even the reason for me having issues with his writing here was the fact that, because of chronological reading order, I'm coming straight from book 5 of the series,Midnight Tides,to which this book simply fails in comparison.But the more I thought, it actually occurred to me that also it fails in comparison with previous installments of this series.Biggest issue I had were dialogues. They weren't as fluent as I'm used to reading from this man, and sometimes they felt too convenient for the plot and story to move forward and it felt like he was leading me with a carrot on the end of a stick.The reason why I love this series and his writing is because he usually tends to avoid doing just that.3.41/5So it is closer to 4 than it is to 3. If prose was better, it would easily topple over.Overall, 3 is anything but a bad rating.Kharkanas TrilogyForge of DarknessFall of LightPath to Ascendancy seriesDancer's LamentDeadhouse LandingMalazan Empire seriesNight Of KnivesMalazan Book of the Fallen seriesGardens of the MoonDeadhouse GatesMemories of IceMidnight TidesUltimate Malazan Chronological Reading Order
