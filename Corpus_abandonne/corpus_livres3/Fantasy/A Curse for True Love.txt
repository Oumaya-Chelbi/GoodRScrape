3.5 stars“Where are we going?” she asked.A dimple appeared just below a cut on his cheek. “We can go wherever you want, Little Fox.”jacks is the leader of thesassy men epidemicand i’m living for it. and him wearing olive green trousers and a plain white shirt half-buttoned with his sleeves rolled up.. that man has style & he’s just perfect 💘💓💝💞💓💖💕warning: this review is going to be super long. i cannot truly express in words how sad i am to give this book this rating.okay i’ve heard a lot of takes about this book and i’m gonna be so fucking honest this was disappointing in a lot of aspects with the plot. the ending was so open ended, which i didn’t mind, but there were so many plot holes. that being said, i still liked this book but i truly wanted more from it. i saw the same problem with finale, so i don’t know if stephanie garber genuinely doesn’t know how to wrap everything up or she left everything open on purpose. (i’ve heard that take and i can’t bring myself to accept it, there’s a limit for how much u can leave open ended and there was A LOT in this book.)spoiler alert !!let me elaborate on this take - i saw this tiktok talking about how there were so many questions bc it’s metaphorically supposed to represent the story curse and how no one truly knows what happened, in the case of the valley arch and what happened to the valors themselves. however, i feel like it would’ve been suitable had it not been the last book in this series. this is very conflicting to rate bc on one hand i feel like the romance delivered but on the other hand it feels like the plot wasn’t completely thought out. and i did expect so much more from the romance still. jacks loved evangeline so much that he rewrote history but we still can’t get a love confession out of him? 😭😭end of spoilersi’m not gonna be the first to admit i love stephanie garber’s writing. i’ve been very vocal about it ever since i first read her other series ‘caraval’ earlier this year. i don’t have a problem with her writing, i think that it can be very magical and i’m glad it hasn’t changed much. one thing that has changed is the plots of her books. when i read the caraval series, the romance stayed a subplot but with this series, everyone fixates on the romance and i think stephanie garber did the same. at the end she doesn’t clear anything up and i think it might be a way to appeal to the audience bc let’s admit - a lot of ppl read fantasy for the sprinkle of romance.i had a few problems with caraval, but overall i loved it and it was very magical. i will stand by this - i love caraval for the magical world building, where the world goes more into depth and is much more magical, and i love ouabh for the romance. don’t get me wrong, the romance in caraval was almost impeccable. however the characters and their background in this series varied very differently. there was so much depth to these characters and jacks was so much more mysterious. his backstory and everything had me bawling. this is why i truly wanted a better ending for evajacks. i feel very conflicted about this book bc i love the characters so much.unfortunately there are going to be spoilers for the rest of this review. i cannot express a lot of my thoughts without mentioning spoilersthe 2 main villains in this book were aurora and apollo. and like i mentioned before, there was no clarification for the other “villains” in the previous books. i am so confused why we never find out what happens to all the other villains in the other books. marisol and tiberius had absolutely no role. she leaves it open ended in the other book about tiberius and we never find out what happens to him but apparently in this book we don’t find out either!! even luc was mentioned once but he never once appeared. it felt as if stephanie garber thought it would be good if she introduced a new villain rather than addressing the previous ones but no!! i expected tiberius to make his comeback but he was only mentioned a few times in the beginning. the fact that he was pretty much all talk no action is prominent in this book lmaoo. and marisol wasn’t even mentioned. does she just rot in jail..? either way i have hope for stephanie garber. she is still one of my favorite authors and even though i didnt like this book as much, her writing shows promise and i hope that it only improves from now.my thoughts:i’m ngl i have mixed feelings about chaos, or castor. i felt so sad after that ending with evangeline last book (like everyone else ofc) but i wonder how chaos would’ve reacted if he found out he killed eva. he seemed apologetic in the last book but he ran away (probably bc of fear). but this book he’s helping eva bc he believed jacks is going to make a huge mistake. i think chaos is overall a good person (even if he went on a whole mf blood rampage 😭😭) but i don’t blame him after he was forced to wear a helm.And he loved her.He loved her.He loved her.He loved her.He loved her so much he’d rewritten history. He’d given up what he had believed was his only chance at love. And now he had finally broken the spell that he never thought he’d escape.jacks has my whole heart. don’t u dare try and start with him not deserving a happy ending he has been through so much and he deserves the world. he’s been through so much pain, and when he talked about how he felt whenever he thought about how evangeline died i lowkey teared up 😭💘 and when he told her oh my god i was dying. that entire scene is engraved into my brain now. HE ALSO KEPT HER NOTE ABOUT HIM CLOSE TO HIS HEART everything he does is just perfect and amazing<33 every single little detail is forever engraved in my heart.evangeline has been everything throughout this entire series. her dumb decisions kept the book entertaining i’m not even gonna lie. but also her love confession to jacks had me sobbing my eyes out it was so sweet. she has been through so much and i’m so so happy she ended up with jacks. she has been through so much and i love how she learned not to be as naive for the most part. she also learned to be more sassy and stand up for herself her character development has been everything. and her slapping apollo after she got her memories back was QUEEN SHIT 👏👏 eva is my girl 4eva and i absolutely love her. even if she was delulu at times but who isn’t? honestly i love how she still had so much hope but didn’t feel like it was enough like omg girl 😭😭 i felt so bad for her.i feel like this book went completely off script. it introduced new villains (besides apollo), didn’t even clarify anything in the previous books, and the ratio of romance changed drastically. i wanted more angst, more JACKS (!!), and a much more deserved ending. i feel as though she just forgot about the other books and decided to change it up. there was so much angst in the previous books and i thought that it would build up in this book into a huge love confession of jacks part but nope. this does not mean i like jacks any less. these characters mean so much to me and i’m happy that they ended up together.there are spoilers for the caraval series mentioned in this paragraph!!the least disappointing aspect was the romance. but that’s not to say there was no disappointment bc my expectations were through the roof after tbona. there were sprinkles of it which i didn’t mind bc it’s a fantasy book, it’s not always going to focus on the romance aspects. but i still don’t understand how their relationship is gonna work with jacks being immortal and evangeline being a human. i mean dante gave up his immortality for donatella 🥹 i rlly expected a grand gesture from jacks, or anything. the best we got was an “i love you” and even though im happy he said it, it was the bare. fucking. minimum. and it hurts me to say that, trust me. the romance was through the roof with this series, but it drastically changed in this book. their love expanded to every universe and we couldn’t even get a love confession out of jacks? i will never get over that.the plot twist about the truth of jacks curse? i’m ngl my heart broke a little after hearing donatella never loved him which was why she survived his kiss. this is not me in any saying i ship them. but when you think about their history and how it applies then knowing the info now, it makes me feel for jacks. he dyed his hair dark blue, it was clear he was heartbroken. and to learn she never had any feelings for him made me feel a bit of nostalgia. also i have another question - does jacks ever find out the truth of his kisses and how they’re only deadly if someone who will never love him kisses him..?the ending with apollo becoming part of the tree actually made me laugh. another thing that has me laughing was how stephanie garber talked in an interview about how the tree on the cover is important in the book AND ITS LITERALLY THE TREE APOLLO GOT TRAPPED IN 😭😭 she rlly knows us!! i’m so glad he got what was coming to him. that scene frustrated me so much and I’M SO GLAD JACKS GAVE HIM WHAT HE DESERVED!! i waited 2 books for jacks to finally punch apollo and it happened, and i’m so satisfied with that !! and him cursing at apollo had my entertainment reaching its peak. i will say she had me in the first few chapters feeling sympathy for apollo but that quickly went away after everything happened. i’m still upset he killed the guards that only followed his command ☹️—the rest of this review is going to be talking about things that were mentioned/i still had questions about after the ending.would you guys believe me if i said this book was going to previously by 4.5 stars? maybe u won’t, but it’s true. during the beginning, it was rlly slow bc apollo made so many appearances and i was bored out of my mind. but every time jacks showed up it made everything better. at one point, i was contemplating on giving it 4.75 stars. can u imagine my disappointment at giving it the rating i’m giving it now?probably notbut the ending was disappointing. maybe it was just me idk but it isn’t even about the apples as much.speaking of the apples, i didnt mind that as much simply bc she explicitly stated that we would know, and even addressed it which was what i wanted the entire time. if she addressed any of the plot holes, i would’ve been happy. the point of a finale is to wrap everything up and maybe if she wrote another book in this series i’d be happy but this is the end of THIS series so i don’t get why so many things were alluded. the fan theories for the apples have me squealing, i’m kinda glad she didn’t explicitly state it simply bc letting us gather our own conclusion lets us be delulu.another thing - the broken heart scar? i don’t understand why it was never used. was it just a way for eva to sense whenever jacks was nearby since it glowed? i expected more from that. i read the bonus epilogues, and it’s clear that stephanie hasn’t forgotten about it. she mentions it but doesn’t even tell us what’s gonna happen. i really expected something when it was first mentioned in the beginning while i was reading this book. i thought the mention of the scar was going to be foreshadowing but i was disappointed to find out it wasn’t. it’s basically used as a tell tale sign that jacks is nearby.something i’m curious about is how evangeline didn’t die when she kissed jacks. i think the obstacle of apollo helped show how he would meet his end eventually but also i think it helped show that there were other forms of consequences? idk i can’t wrap my head around the fact that it was so easy for them to finally kiss after not kissing for over 2 books. there’s no confirmation, just guesses evangeline has made which makes it all the more confusing. she talks about how his love might help break the curse but i wish stephanie garber confirmed at least something. i finished reading and i honest to god had to think about this book for a long time. it was so bittersweet finishing this series. but the scene where jacks had a scare and he was scared she was dying but she just forgot to breath was so cute i was laughing through my tears at that 🥹🩷i’m disappointed lala didn’t end up punching aurora, which would’ve been fully deserved. we don’t find out anything ab lala besides the fact that she was left alone w aurora after eva left to stop jacks. and it’s clear that she wasn’t punched since she was able to leave lala and distract jacks from finding evangeline. i wonder what’s gonna happen with lala now that she’s done her part helping eva find jacks in their last quest? i feel like it was only a happy conclusion for evajacks and not anyone else who helped them along the way. also i’m so sad she didn’t get a happy ending even after meeting her true love. she truly deserves one and i hope stephanie garber does end up writing another series for her.ˏˋ°•*⁀➷once upon a broken heart - 4.5 starsthe ballad of never after - 4.5 starsa curse for true love - 3.5 starspre-reviewi can’t believe i finished this series. i just know i’m gonna have the biggest hangover over these characters and the world stephanie garber has created 🥹 rtc soon 🤍 but for now i just have to say ‘say don’t go’ by taylor swift is soo evajacks codedreading reviewi’ve been waiting for this day for FUCKING FOREVER and i’m so excited!!pre-read review3 DAYS LEFT!! and i’m going crazy !!!after reading tbonano words will ever describe how badly iNEEDthis book. i understand everyone’s pain now. i desperately need evajacks to be endgame and i’m not accepting anything else.before reading tbonai manifested that this book would come sooner and instead the date levitated farther away
