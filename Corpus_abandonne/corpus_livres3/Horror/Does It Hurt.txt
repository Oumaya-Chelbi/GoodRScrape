I’ve already conquered your ocean, amore mio. You have nothing left to give that I want.”never before scene photo: enzo after sawyer orgasms iykykthe degrading was fantastic, but what was even better is when would degrade her and start feeling bad afterwards. i loved that he starting to battle his inner need to make her hurt, while also battling his need to protect her from everything, including himself ✨when sawyer asked him to say everything he couldn’t tell her, in italian...I WAS RUNNING TO GOOGLE TRANSLATE EVERY TIME HE SPOKE—“È impossibile odiarti quando mi fai sentire così vivo.”It’s impossible to hate you when you make me feel so alivei just loved them together and the smut was 10/10 so that’s always a bonus 💗 what i’ve learned about HDC, since thecat and mouse duet, is that she knows EXACTLY how to write an asshole. at the same time, i just loved how much enzo cared about sawyer whilealsobeing possessive. he had the whole “no one can hurt her but me” going on and it was perfecthonorable mention:one of the few times when enzo would praise her and degrade her in the same breath 🫦😮‍💨🥰“That’s it, you love being a good girl for me, don’t you, baby?” he drawls. “Just like you love coming all over my cock like a desperate little slut.”the caretakerCRAZY FUCKER, ON GOD. i really liked the mystery surrounding sylvester and the lighthouse. it definitely added an extra umph to the book and made it more than just an enemies-to-lovers with a whole lot of kinks.SPOILERS BELOW REGARDING MYSTERY OF SYLVESTER AND THE LIGHTHOUSE☆☆☆i had an inkling that the footsteps, the knocking and the chain clanging that sawyer and enzo kept hearing weren’t actually ghosts of those who died at the lighthouse.it was actually giving me jane eyre vibes since the footsteps actually belonged to sylvester’s daughter whom he held captive. her whole story was horribly tragic, she deserved so much fucking better but her death meant enzo lived soooo SORRY GIRL ✌🏻 it was just your time to go <3honestly, watching enzo brutally kill syl was one of the highlights of the novel hehehei wished enzo could have used his godlike persona to resurrect syl and do it again😍random note:enzo vitale is who i thoughtkillian carsonwould be ☹️forever thankful thatneelaintroduced me to this author and sorry for leaving you in the dust with our br 💀
