Books are art and art is subjective. These are just my personal thoughts. They are not meant to be taken as broader commentary on the general quality of the work. Believe me, I have not enjoyed many an excellent book, and my individual lack of enjoyment has not made any of those books less excellent or (more relevantly) less successful.*******************************************I know I make a deal about not having favourites but Nghi Vo has become one of those authors who I will follow into the fire. She could publish her shopping list and I would be there for it.All of which is to say, there was a lot I loved about What The Dead Know but it mostly felt like things I already love about Nghi Vo rather specific to What The Dead Know itself, if that makes sense.The plot here is that a couple of charlatans, posing as mediums, are hired as the entertainment at girl’s finishing school in smalltown Illinois. A sudden storm forces them to spend the night, forcing to the heroine to confront for real this time the voices of the dead she usually just pretends to hear.The story showcases all of Vo’s strengths: buckets of atmosphere, an intriguing setting conveyed in a way that makes it feel both familiar and strange, fascinatingly flawed characters who—because of race, gender and/or queerness—are constantly forced to reckon with their place in the world, and, of course, absolutely fucking exquisite prose:[The house] lifted up to the sky with two low wings fanning out to either side, its diamond-paned windows picking up what little light they could and gleaming like coyote eyeshine in the dimming day.*swoonful sigh*The other thing I love about Vo’s work—and that feels quite unique to her, even though it probably shouldn’t—is the way she depicts significant relationships between queer-coded characters that never feel secondary to their romantic relationships. And don’t get me wrong, I know romantic relationships are important too—I’m primarily a romance writer for God’s sake—and I know there’s a degree to which it feels like mainstream media still has a lot of catching up to do in terms of depicting queer characters with fully realised romantic and sexual lives. But I think the price we pay for this sometimes is that we lose depictions of queer connectedness that *aren’t* sexual or romantic. And that’s … lessening. Because queer lives are at their richest when they’re at their most expansive.Oh, I should also probably note at this point, before I get well-actuallyed in the comments, there’s nothing explicit in the story to suggest that either Maryse or Vasyl are queer. I just, rightly or wrongly, got major queer vibes from them.Ultimately, though, I think What The Dead Know suffered slightly for me in its proximity to The Six Deaths of the Saint. This is not, in any way, to compare Vo and Harrow as authors—they’re both brilliant and I love them both—it’s just The Six Deaths of the Saint is a notably remarkable short story. The format and the content are perfectly aligned. Where What The Dead Know felt like a whole book, or at the very least a novella, mutilated into the loose shape of a short story. The ending is wildly rushed in a way that retrospectively unbalances the beginning (even though the build-up was absolutely necessary and, actually, I wish there’d been more of it). And while the villain’s arbitrariness is part of the point there was just too much happening in the last 20% of the story—chases, secrets, ghosts—for the emotions and the themes of the final revelations to land properly.Don’t get me wrong, What The Dead Know is still a fantastically bleak, chilling and intriguing read. It’ll just leave you aching for the novel or novella it so desperately wants to be.
