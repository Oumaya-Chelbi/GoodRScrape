”I have a life, man. And my life isn’t all about feuding demigods and nations at war and solving a mystery before it kills me.”Thomas lifted an eyebrow. “It’s also about mold demons and flaming monkey poo?”“What can I say? I put the ‘ick’ in ‘magic’.”Well, Harry, let’s just agree that your always have a lot on your plate? ;-P Because quite honestly, monkey poo and mold demons are the least of your problems! There are more important things you’ll have to tackle. Like for instance the set of an erm - let’s say - particular kind of movie only adults are allowed to watch. *lol* Then again Thomas was the one who recruited you for this case and we all know what the White Court thrives on, right? *wriggles eyebrows*For some reason Harry seems to have no trouble to fit into this world though. Should we be concerned or happy? I can’t decide. Guess whatever floats your boat, Harry? *lol* Like for instance a sexy as hell vampire from the White Court that goes by the name Lara?! I’d be careful with this kind of company though. Hell, no actually I wouldn’t. Lara and Thomas would be welcome in mybedflat anytime. ;-P Did I say that out lout? Anyway, moving on!”It made me feel sad, but not bitter. If we had to do it again, he and I would make the same choices. I just wished I’d been able to know him longer than I had. It’s not everyone who can teach you something about faith without saying a word to do it.”Between Harry’s new case and his other activities we get reminded of the earlier books. The memory of a certain knight unexpectedly catching us off guard. Or at least it caught me off guard. I didn’t expect to feel so sad about this tiny remark but boy was it bittersweet to read Harry’s thoughts when he entered that room. >_< I guess it’s no wonder our favourite wizard decided to get another pet. There can never be enough fluffy fur in your life. XD Especially if you have a life like Harry, who’s sort of constantly dancing at the edge of life.”My worry and tension slowly grew, and as they did I took a perverse comfort in the familiar emotions. It actually felt good to feel my survival instincts put me on guard against premature mortality.Hell’s bells. Is that insane or what?”Yep, yes it is! Okay, I think now I’m really concerned about his mental health! *lol* All the fluffy fur in the world won’t be able to set that right. Maybe a psychiatrist? I genuinely doubt Kincaid or Ebenezar McCoy will be able to get back Harry’s sanity. This said it was still nice that they made an appearance in this book. Unfortunately I can’t say the same about Mavra. I really don’t like that woman! Erm vampire. >_<”You’re probably right,” she said, nodding. “So I’m not going to kill you for shoving your well-intentioned opinion down my throat in a vulnerable moment. Just this once.””A-and you will be glad to know that every exotic dancer in Chicago is alive and well. Safeguarded by your friendly neighborhood air spirit,” Bob said. “Um. Say, Harry, that is quite the homicidal gleam in your eyes.”As for our two sidekicks Bob and Murphy? Guess Bob needs to get his priorities straight first. *lol* I can’t blame him for all those lovely exotic dancers though. Life as a spirit without a body must be tiresome so I suppose he figured there would be no harm in looking. Well, no other harm than Harry’s “homicidal gleam in his eyes”. Which must have been pretty bad if even Bob got worried. But what can I say? Harry has no time to mess around. Between Mavra, the Raith Clan, payment for Kincaid and one hell of a really nasty entropy curse that threatens not only the people at the set but also his own life Harry clearly has his work cut out for him!”Will you take care of my daughter?”“Yes, ma’am. Of course I will.”Her blue eyes flashed fiercely, and she said, “Let me get you a piece of cake.”Bless Mama Murphy for feeding him in order to regain his strength! *lol* Speaking of which, I consider this to be a blessing for marriage!!! I mean nothing screams “you’re allowed to propose to my daughter” more than to feed her potential love interest! Harry what the freaking hell are you waiting for?! You most definitely have the wrong taste in women, because if I’d be you, I’d have proposed to Murphy about a thousand times! This woman is amazing and she’s able to put up with you! Can’t ask for more than that. ;-PThis said I once again enjoyed another“Harry Dresden”book! As always“Blood Rites”wasn’t only a fast and entertaining read but also kind of cleared the way for even bigger plots in the future. I guess after six books we have quite a lot of storylines that can be picked up and used for further books. And I’m not gonna lie here, I’m so ready for some of them to unfold! ;-P I need book 7 asap!____________________________Seriously, every time I finish another Harry Dresden book my first thought is:Hell’s bells! How come Harry is in even more trouble now?! O_oWell, "Blood Rites" is no exception!After reading this sixth book I think the only reason Harry didn’t die yet is because he’s just too stubborn to. *lol*ANDbecause he has sexy as hell Murphy as his backup!If I’d be him I’d marry that woman! <3Full RTC soon-ish! Stay tuned! ;-)___________________________________Time to tackle the next Harry Dresden book! XDI need something light and not all too serious right now and I think this might be the right choice. Harry never disappoints and Jim Butcher’s books are always easy to read. If you want to compare it to food Harry Dresden most certainly would be the equivalent of fast food for me. *lol*Also this book features Thomas, Harry’s "flirtatious vampire acquaintance" and if that’s not enough reason to read this, then I don’t know. ;-P
