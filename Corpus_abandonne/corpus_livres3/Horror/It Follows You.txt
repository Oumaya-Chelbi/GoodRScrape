IT FOLLOWS YOUbyKeran Pantth Joshiis a collection of short, fast-paced horror stories.The protagonists are in places where they encounter evil forces. As the title suggests, these evil forces follows the protagonists in order to kill them or for their own gain.In the start of the book, we are introduced to Guruji Bhagwati Prasad who is telling these stories and later appears in many. The stories were very different from each other –weird happenings and death around a house with newlyweds, how ‘right swipe’ in dating apps can take a drastic turn, mysterious mass bird suicide and many more.Some stories were gruesome and eerie. From Bangalore to Uttarakhand, they covered many parts of India depicting urban legends associated with the places. There were shocking twists with endings left on cliffhanger meaning low satisfaction. I enjoyed the stories but most were not fearsome. We can also say some delivered a happy ending for the evil?The purpose of author was to deliver horror and make us scared but I don’t think that was achieved in all the stories. The spookiest and chilling one for me wasDon’t Turn Back. Was it frightening!A story that hit hard emotionally wasThe Walk in the Junglewhich showed Indian history in year 1956 . It was a little creepy but the description of mass pandemic deaths in a village where infected were isolated in the forest with no one to care for them was heart wrenching to read. But I also liked how the story showed people at that time living simple and less complicated lives.This book also brings forward rotten views of society such as caste system and beauty standards for marriage and competition. It had an underlining of human emotions and nature, be it jealousy or evilness. But also the goodness such as helping others by sacrificing themselves.I really like the cover art. It is pretty and I cannot stop staring.It follows youwas a good read but not as scary as it looks.Do you know who is ‘IT’ that follows you?
