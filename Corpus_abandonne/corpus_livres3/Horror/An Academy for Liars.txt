I was so excited to read this arc. And now, I’m just really disappointed.2 Stars 🌟 🌟(This will not be a cute review since I didn’t enjoy it lol, don’t wanna take the time)The concept was there, the idea was quite interesting, but the execution just didn’t happen for me.An Academy for Liarsfollows our main character, Lennon. At the beginning of the book, Lennon experiences something that causes her to want to end her life. She reaches out, asking for a sign to make her reconsider. In an eerie parking lot, a phone booth covered in ivy starts to ring. She answers the phone, and is told to head to Ogden, Utah for her interview for Drayton College the very next morning. She goes (who on earth would drive to a stranger’s house lol) and ultimately gets accepted into Drayton College, where she will learn the art of persuasion and influencing one’s will.This concept of persuasion was very intriguing to me, but I personally did not appreciate how it was executed. The book was very fast paced and confusing at times, and we never really stopped to explain things. I think this had potential to have excellent worldbuilding, but there wasn’t much given. I was hoping for a very atmospheric, dark academia novel.I also didn’t necessarily find this to be “dark academia”, which is the whole reason I wanted to read this! It wasn’t moody or atmospheric; it was really weird, grotesque, and more horror-esque at times. I don’t know how to describe it, but the school did not give off dark academia.This book definitely recycles its words often. I’d find the same unique word used multiple times within a few pages, and then there would be a new word that stuck out. This might just be me nitpicking, but it’s something that really takes me out of a story.I am quite tired of the “I’m not good at anything” trope girl who is shocked when someone is jealous of her and her terrible life. This FMC thrives off of this feeling.Also - I know this is an arc, so hopefully this gets fixed before publication, but the amount of hyphens splitting up words was absurd and very distracting. My review is completely based on the story, but the format was completely jacked up. The wo-rding was li-ke th-is for the entire-ty of the bo-ok.*Spoilers Ahead*Lennon- Our FMC is in her mid-twenties and is one of the most powerful persuasionists in awhile, due to her ability to “open gates”. I feel like Lennon made stupid decisions left and right through this book, and it just became infuriating to me. She purposefully overdoses on cocaine to see if it’ll open up gates (I felt like I was doing illegal substances side by side with our FMC with how much of a mindfuck this book was lol). And later, we discover she’s quite the murderer. Lennon is incredibly whiny and pick-me throughout the book, and I simply did not like a single thing about her.Dante- Our mystery man. The thirty-something year old professor who says he can’t get with the younger student, but then one night he magically changes his mind (Sorry, I really hate the professorxstudent trope). Supposed to be morally gray, but not much going for him. We learn he has a dark past, but then we never get to dive into it at all. His character was incredibly one dimensional, and I also had no feelings toward his character.I did not enjoy any characters in this story, actually.Lennon and Dante have a weird romance in this book. I feel like it can’t even be classified as a slow burn because there are no sparks between them at all. The chemistry is not there at all - there are no elements available for chemistry to even happen. They get together in Dante’s house in South Carolina, and it was really, really awkward. Here’s a direct quote: “From then on, they did what they did in silence”. They did what they did? And silence? You’re telling me I’m supposed to believe these characters have chemistry!?I was so disappointed by this book. I wanted the dark academia vibes with some forbidden romance, and I was left empty handed. It didn’t stand out in any way to me, and the whole story felt one dimensional. The potential for an incredible world and story was there, but was poorly executed.Thank you NetGalley for providing me with this arc!
