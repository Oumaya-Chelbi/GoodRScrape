5 Stars🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟forever!!🖤🎃🎄My Childhood Favorite🖤🎃🎄First of all, I’d like to thank the author, Megan Shepherd for writing the novelization of one of the greatestHalloween-Christmas storiesof all times!! When I found out this existed, I simply had to own it for my collection!! Not only does Megan zoom into each and every scene with immaculate detail, but she also reveals small hints involving the amazing cast of characters that may have been overlooked in just watching the film. But just remember, this is a novelization and not a retelling!Speaking of the film…I’ve probably watched it about a hundred times and watched it for the very first time when I was an itty bitty little one. It came out just 2 years after I was born! I know all the songs by heart, and I can honestly say Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King was my first crush!🖤💀😂🤫I am really sure this was also the reason I became obsessed with Halloween!Most of this review is going to be me gushing about my love for this story. So here goes it…🎄From the very beginning moments, I am always completely hypnotized, and my soul absolutely sings every time I hear the intro:"Twas a long time ago, longer now than it seems, in a place that perhaps you’ve seen in your dreams. For the story that you are about to be told took place in the holiday worlds of old."🖤Jack and Sally will forever be my favorite couple. Sally’s song is melancholic and haunting. It holds so much meaning. ♡♡I sense there’s something in the windThat feels like tragedy’s at handAnd though I’d like to stand by himCan’t shake this feeling that I haveThe worst is just around the bendAnd does he notice my feelings for him?And will he see how much he means to me?🎃I read somewhere Megan Shepherd may be in the process of writing sequels to The Nightmare Before Christmas, and I am so excited!!! I can only imagine how awesome this will be to follow what happens to Jack and Sally. I can’t wait!!🎄A favorite quote from the novel:“It was starting to seem that whatever he did, he couldn’t shake the Halloween spirit that haunted his every move.”ME ALL YEAR LONG – I CAN RELATE!🖤I often randomly find myself singing Kidnap the Sandy Claws in my head while I’m typing away at work.Kidnap the Sandy Claws, lock him up real tightThrow away the key and then turn off all the lights.I chose the perfect time to read this right before Christmas and drift back into every moment of all the nostalgia. As Jack says, “Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night!” 🎄🎃🎄🎃🎄🎃I hope to watch this movie again another hundred times in my lifetime!2024 Monster Mash Challenge Met:|The Mummy Category|◇ Read a book with tombs or cemeteries.✔️
