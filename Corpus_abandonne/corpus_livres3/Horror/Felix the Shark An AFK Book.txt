3.5/5Well I did not expect another volume in the series but here we are again. And the next series is on the way.So, in the first story we got a nice investigation going on although the ending was once again very predictable - last volumes got very repetitive and lacked interesting ending for most part. I was curious as to how they will introduce a shark and honestly it made sensebuilding a shark tank that goes against all health regulations? What a guy, 10/10 I would do the same. Also the friend going on about his boss being a robot? In this universe? I bet he is right, it's either an animatronic or his body was snatched by some other spirit.. Felix was very cute, would pet.The second story was quite nice, a bit over the top at times but I liked the investigation and how it started/ended. It was funny to see fnaf games and fanfiction being a part of the world were the real fasbear restaurants existed. Not really compliant with what we saw till now but fun to read.The last story was my favourite from this volume. It was great to see a third person perspective on fazbear craziness. Some things the mother had to hear from her child were so creepy, I loved this. Also points to the mom for being so supportive.Mike, what are you doing here? What a cameo, like really would love to get more info on this..There is, to no ones' surprise, no extra story at the end of the book since we got everything closed in the previous one. I think they wanted to publish this volume on the hype of the new game, which is fine I guess but wasn't necessary.
