3.5 banter and tension starsThis is a quick holiday read, low angst, and fast paced. I just wish it was longer 😭Dominic and Georgia work together, but Georgia shouldn’t be working for Dominic 😬. In fact, there have been some close calls when it comes to his health 🤣 (he even gets woken up because it seems someone he works with… ahem… Georgia… keeps googling ways to un alive him 🤣) and other random inconsistencies that happen 🤣.Georgia’s in a relationship and Dominic has a girlfriend as well, but that girlfriend is more like a façade, because he really wants Georgia. Although Georgia is with her boyfriend, she hasn’t been intimate with him in a while. It all comes to a stop when she comes home early from work and finds him being intimate with her roommate 😑.She goes to work to get away from her place; luckily, Dominic’s still there, and things get hot pretty quickly 👀. She ends up getting fired because, well, they shouldn’t be getting physical.So, she goes back home, to Colorado, and pretends that she’s engaged to her ex-boyfriend still 😅. Almost a year passes and she ends up needing to use the Office Guest app to find a man that could pretend to be her fiancé.Destiny has plans for her, because the man that ends up showing up to pretend to be her fiancé is none other than Dominic, her old boss 👀.And the tension couldn’t be thicker 👀😉😈What I liked/love:— the banter 🤣. These two can’t help but attack each other with words 🤣. I giggled so many times 🤣. The freaking audacity sometimes 👏🏻—the internet searches were hilarious 💀🤣. And the random pranks done 👏🏻 I laughed way too much for these 🤣—Webster’s Bastard letter 🤡—the tension 👀. Ufff. These two have been wanting each other for a while 😅—the 🔥. Oh Lawd. It gets 🥵. I wish they were more detailed, but I enjoyed what we got—OMD 😈. I luuuurve it in my books, especially when the hero, Dominic, takes care of the trash 😉—how alpha and dirty-talking Dominic can get 💦What I didn’t like/wanted more of: SPOILERS—that it was longer 😏. Whitney G has a potential fee a five star automatic read for me, but I really needed more in this book 😭—how fast it all moves 😏. I wish we had more details on things. I mean; there were times I needed to suspend my belief, but it was mostly because things were moving fast. I get it; it’s a novella, but still 😭—more 🔥 and less FTB 😐. Sigh. there’s so much tension, and the first time they do anything besides kiss becomes a FTB scene 😑. And then we just get a summary of what happens after, which is annoying. Also, once they’re finally completely physical, we also get summaries afterwards. Sigh 😭— the unresolved OWD 😑. I feel like the book could’ve done without any, because what we do get feels unresolved. The other woman causes some minor drama that Georgia doesn’t find out about, and then it just gets dropped, as in, we don’t get a resolution for it. Did anything happen with/to her? Why not just omit it 😬. It didn’t add anything to the story because Georgia never finds out, so it would’ve been better if it just wasn’t part of the plot.— a proper epilogue 😭. It’s only a year later when it happens, but I wish we had more details about their lives.Overall, I enjoyed this but just wanted it to be longer⚠️safety squad⚠️-no cheating*/sharing-OMD: the h’s ex tries to cause drama. Luckily the H is very confident so it doesn’t work-mild OWD: the H’s ex tries to cause him drama before he sees the h again. Nothing comes from anything-condom (only one sex scene)/the H has basically been celibate since wanting the h and never slept with his “girlfriend”/the h hadn’t had sex with her boyfriend in a long time before the book begins-HEA/epilogue/one year later
