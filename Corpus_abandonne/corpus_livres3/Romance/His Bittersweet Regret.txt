⭐ 4.5 ⭐Second chance.. Yes? No? Yes? Maybe or maybe not? Hmm... This book and this story is very realistic one. Never say never!Through whole book I was like: GO GIRL, GO GIRL! 💪 Just like that, bravo! 👏 Make him suffer!!! And God, how he suffered...! 😁 She made it!Opal, my girl... Wow, just wow. Finally, we got this kind of female main character. What "backbone" we got here. 😅 This heroine here, is so strong and so brave. We all need to have some of her character and determination in us.“What happened to you?” He whispered.“YOU DID! You happened to me. You broke me! Now get the hell out of my house!”“No. Marsh, just no. You don’t get to feel bad about that. It’s what you wanted.”"You put yourself in that situation and kept yourself there, Marsh. No one else. And now, you have regrets about your decision. Imagine that. You went from not wanting to have regrets about staying with me to having regrets about throwing me away and losing me forever.”* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *And Marsh... You... You are so stupid, foolish, selfish and weak boy, asshole and BIG IDIOT. Like she said: "Stupid brain. Stupid man."Karma... Karma... Karma...But somehow I was rooting for you. God... 🤦"I was not just an asshole, I was a complete piece of shit.""In fact, it was one of the worst, and most regretful experiences of my life.”"It had all been about me and what I thought I needed in order to prove that I’d never become my dad. The crazy thing is, looking back, what I did was far worse than what my father put Mom through.Far. Far. Worse."* * * * * * * * * * * * * * P.S. * * * * * * * * * * * * * *If you want to see if this book is for you, see below (only from Opal's POV)...* * * * * * * * * * SOME SPOILERS * * * * * * * * * *“It was you who wanted your freedom. You who wanted to fuck other women. You who wanted to know what it was like to date someone other than me. I never wanted any of that, so you, Marshal Kennedy, can go fuck yourself and stay far away from me while you do it.”* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *"Marsh sat slumped into himself on the couch, face buried in his hands, and shoulders shaking as he cried. He wasn’t just crying, it was full-on sobbing, the likes of which I had never seen him do. For a minute, my heart broke for him. Then, I remembered he had been the one to put me in the same position, only I was left crying for many days and nights, for months on end."* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *“Was he a moron? Yes. Did he do idiotic things? Yes, again. Did he break your heart to pieces and make me want to break his legs and his dick in much the same way? Also yes. Does any of that mean you aren’t the love of his life? No. Anyone with a pair of working eyeballs can see that you two are soulmates. Hell, even a blind person could see it just by spending five minutes ina room with you. The energy you two put off is electric.”“A soulmate wouldn’t do that to their other half,” I whispered.“Normally, I’d agree with you. I’m not saying you should forgive him, forget what he did, or not go on living your life and making decisions like he doesn’t exist beyond his connection to your son. I’m just saying that the man never stopped loving you. It’s obvious.”* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *“Christ! Opal, I swear to you, the whole time we were apart all I could think of was you. I wished away the six months, in hopes that we could get back together sooner.”I scrunched my nose, whether in distaste or disbelief I couldn’t be certain. Probably a mix of both. “That is the grossest thing you could have ever said to me.”“What? Why?” His voice grew excited, and I could see it plain on his confused face that he had no clue what he’d just implied.“All you could think of was me? So, you went out on dates with a bunch of other women, and you thought of me?” He nodded his head. “Did you think about how knowing you were were with other women made me ache like my heart was going to beat right out of my chest and I would die?”“You keep mentioning these six months, like there was some sort of Hallmark event that was supposed to happen. What did you think would happen after six months trying to find an upgrade for a girlfriend?”“I was never looking for an upgrade. That could never happen,” he denied.“Then why were you looking at all? If you already had the best person for you, then why were you out there searching for something else?”“I thought we needed to both experience the things we never did when we were younger, so that neither of us would have doubts later, like my father did. I meant what I said, I only thought of you during that time.”I scoffed at that. “So, when you were fucking Monica unprotected you were thinking of me? Thinking of the diseases you would bring home in a couple days? Thinking of the baby that you’d have me raise if you knocked her up?”“I wasn’t thinking about anything, except how angry I was that some other man put a baby in your belly and you didn’t seem to wait very long before you went there with someone else,” he yelled at me.I shook my head. “It never occurred to you that you were the asshole who left me with a baby in my belly to go off and sleep with other women? You thought so little of me that you left without so much as a conversation, and your first thought upon seeing me pregnant was that I was somehow more of a whore than you were, and slept around?”“Opal, that’s not fair. What was I supposed to think?”“I don’t know, Marsh, maybe that you left me so fucking heartbroken that I couldn’t function for months on end, especially since I was carrying your baby and having to listen to the gossip about your latest dates around town. You couldn’t even respect me enough to go on your dates somewhere else. No. I had people sending me pictures of you. Did you know I had to change my phone number to get it to stop? And all the while, I was sick every day because the baby we made together didn’t like the smell of food, or my anxiety, or my sadness.”“Opal,” his voice broke...“No. Marsh, just no. You don’t get to feel bad about that. It’s what you wanted.”“It’s not what I wanted. It’s never been what I wanted! I didn’t want to see you in so much pain…”“What in the hell did you think would happen when I got home that day to find the apartment cleaned out and have a less than five-minute conversation where you told me that you needed six months to date other people? Did you think I would be happy about that?”* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *"You put yourself in that situation and kept yourself there, Marsh. No one else. And now, you have regrets about your decision. Imagine that. You went from not wanting to have regrets about staying with me to having regrets about throwing me away and losing me forever.”“No! Don’t say that! How can you say that?”“Because it is the truth. You think I want a man who would so easily cast me aside for others? Who would think the worst of me and go sleep with another woman as an act of revenge when I did nothing wrong? You think I want a man who values everyone else’s opinions above our relationship? I don’t want you anymore, Marsh.If I hadn’t been pregnant, I would have already been dating, or moved to another town to start my life over without you. That would have been the better option for me. Since you left me with child, I don’t even get the dignity of a fresh start in a town where I haven’t been made a mockery of.”“Fuck!” He hissed under his breath as he turned away from me.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *“Austin Jason Kennedy, these are your uncles, Bastion and Brixton,” I told my son. “You will never again see them in the same room with your mother for any reason. If you see them again, it will be because your father took you to see them. I hope you never hold that against me and know that it’s a rule I’m setting in place to protect myself from the two people who have bullied me for years – for no apparent reason – other than it was entertaining to them.”* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *“I’m scared. I know you didn’t betray me by cheating, but you betrayed me by leaving the way you did. I don’t know if I could ever trust being with that version of you again.”* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
