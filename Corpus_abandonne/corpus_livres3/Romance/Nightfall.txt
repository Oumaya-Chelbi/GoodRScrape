2.5 STARSTRIGGER WARNINGPhysical AbuseSo the definition of "LOVE" in this series is that once confessed, they HAVE to fuck/touch/kiss someone from the gang.Corrupt - Rika uses the word love, threesome with Kai.Hideaway - The word "Love" was not used yet but still we got a scene where Rika and Banks were making out and then Michael and Kai join them. I didn't want to leave them out of the party.Kill Switch - Winter uses the word love, threesome with Will. (Will can touch winter and all but just can't put his dick inside her)Hideaway - Emory used the word love, Later she fucks Alex in front of EVERYONE except Damon and Winter. Also let's not forget in the past where Will uses the L word and gets a blowjob from Damon while Emmy watches.So you see the pattern here, so IF you are okay with that then you might enjoy the series. But the thing is I was not. When you use the word Love that means THEY ARE IT! NO ONE ELSE MATTERS. You don't need to fuck someone else to make them realize that they love you, you dont need to fuck someone to get the others attention. This was why even though I loved "Hideaway" and "Kill Switch" I just couldn't give those two books more than four stars.Since I got that out of the way let's talk about Nightfall.I should NEVER keep expectations for an upcoming book. And this is all on me. It's just how the characters reacted or behaved during certain scenes pissed me off. I am so confused right now with this book. There were parts I liked and parts I HATED.PlotEmory wakes up in Blackchurch with no memory of how she got here. A place where the rich send their spoiled kids to be disciplined. There she meets Will (one of the 5 men living in the house) who she hasn't seen in nine years since he went to jail for beating up a cop (the cop was Emory's brother). No one knows why she is there, or at least no one was willing to share the information with her, she had to wait for 29 days until the cleaners would come to clean the house to make her escape. Until then she is stuck in their with 4 dangerous strangers and Will who hates her.Now we get to read Will and Emmy's past and present.The past was kind of boring honestly, It was from when they both were still in high school and how Will tried so hard to get Emory's attention, I was either skipping or sobbing during the scenes where Martin abused Emmy and sometimes smiling thanks to Will. The whole banter between them was basically repetitive, Will will be all cute and nice to her and Emory would just say something bitchy to him. Sometimes would give into Will but then go Cold on him the next day. It was very frustrating because of the way she treated Will. But then to some extend I understood why she wanted Will to stay away because of her brother. So every time Emory's response pissed me off I would make excuses for her, even though sometimes I wanted to slap her repeatedly for saying shit to a guy like Will.“But you’re going to be fucking mine someday,” he growled. “Come hell or high water, Emory Scott. You’re my woman, and you’re going to come home to me every day and sit at my table and warm my fucking bed.” He kissed me. “And you’re going to give me a Will Grayson IV. Mark my words.”There were times where Emory finally did something good, like when she went to homecoming to surprise Will after being a bitch to him. She did try, I know she wanted to be with Will and it was her brother holding her back so I did try to be understanding and give her the benefit of the doubt.Let's talk about the present Emory who I had a hot and cold relationship with. Nine years passed by since Will went to jail because of HER. Nine years of Will ruining himself and Emory feeling guilty about it (as per her) but never ONCE reached out to him. The only reason Will and Emmy even happened now was because she somehow ended up in Blackchurch. She was otherwise just too busy living her own life while Will was busy ruining his, something she was well aware of and kept on throwing on Will's face. Every time she would get jealous or pissed at Will she STILL would say harsh things to him. The past I made up excuses for her because she was an abused teenager but now she was a full on adult who was living her OWN life away from her brother. She had enough time to change herself. But she didn't. But THANK GOD ALEX WAS THERE TO SHUT EMMY UP. GOD I LOVE THAT WOMAN.“You were always pathetic,” I told him, sneering. “You know that? Always so naïve and clueless and pathetic.”A smack landed on my face, the sting spreading across my cheek and blood seeping into my mouth where it cut on my teeth.”Yup, I love Alex. And sometimes I wish she was Will's love interest.But then there were moments where I felt bad for Emory when I read things like this“While you’ve been buried in this,” he told Will, “she’s been sad and sorry.”His eyes flashed to me, and Will stood there frozen, while Alex quickly fastened her pants.“It’s plain as day who really suffered during your time apart,” he bit out. “She owes you nothing.”“Do what you want, Emory,” he told me. “It’s okay.”My heart splintered a little more, and I looked away, shaking my head. What I would have given for Will to say that just once. Or my brother.”“If Will or Martin had given me freedom, I would’ve wanted them more. That was all he had to do. He just had to let me come to him. Like the Homecoming dance.”So yeah I sympathized with her but at the same time was really frustrated with her. I wanted to read about a different Emory during the present time, I wish she had changed over the years and had become a different person. A better version of her past self. Sadly that did not happen. Which leads me to my next point, Why was Will so in love with her? I finished the book and still don't have a proper answer. I just know that Will has always been in LOVE with her but WHY? What did he see in her? I failed to understand.Now let's just talk about this scene okay. They have escaped Blackchurch thanks to the horsemen and their wives/girlfriends. Will tells everyone that Emmy was the reason they all actually went to jail, yes the videos was leaked by Travis but something else happened behind the scenes. And he got to know about it from HIS grandfather and not Emory himself, so he is angry at her for never trusting him and telling him about it, also about Martin's abuse and for never contacting him all these years. He does not believe she can ever be part of the group and is finally deciding to let her go.BUT THEEEEEEEEEN the Alex and Emory scene I mentioned in the start happened. One minute Emory was apologizing to everyone and saying she will try to earn their trusts the next minute she is shouting at everyone that they don't deserve her. Alex gets pissed and is like "TAKE OFF MY CLOTHES" which leads to both of them fucking while Will and everyone else watch. It was like a swingers party? or Orgy? I don't know what the correct term to use here is but like everyone started fucking their significant other while watching Alex and Emory.“Will?” I panted, keeping my eyes closed as she sucked. “I want to be in one of your videos.”Let me put it on the line like them right now, and no going back.Alex groaned. “You sure?” she taunted. “You want a video of you fucking me?”So after this scene Will concludes that Emory is ACTUALLY ONE OF THEM! YAY!“She fit with us.She was made for us.”yes, I can see that. Wow.Again WHY COULDN'T THIS HAPPEN BEFORE EMORY SAID SHE LOVES WILL. Now you can argue with me that, we know they both love each other even if they don't confess it, so what is the big deal? Yes I know, but I feel like confessing is a huge deal in a relationship and should not be taken so lightly. So scenes like this is a deal breaker FOR ME when it happens AFTER the confession.Anyway lets also look at the good aspects of the bookThe epilogue was extremely cute, Damon being called the hug machine by his son 😂😂I just loved the bond between the Horsemen and when they came to save Will, OH GOD THAT SCENE!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭“Same parties. Same girls,” Michael mumbled. “I’m fucking bored.”“I know.” Kai let out a sigh. “I’m feeling it, too. I need something to happen.”“Something to obsess over,” Michael added.And then Damon chimed in. “We should kill someone.”Yes, Damon will forever be my favorite horsemen.To some of the cute moments between Emory and Will“I’m marrying you,” I whispered.He nodded. “’Bout time you caught up.”I started to laugh, diving in and kissing him, cheers going off at the tavern.”“I actually don’t know how to dance,” I told him.I’d never done this before.Taking my waist, he pulled me in, and I gasped, my arms instinctively wrapped round his neck.“Put your feet on mine,” he said.Without argument, I stepped up on his shoes in my pink heels, happy to just hold on. Tipping my head back, I looked up at him as he held me close and started moving, turning in a slow circle and box-stepping small enough for me to easily follow.“You look beautiful,” he said.I might come back later and change the rating from 2.5 to 3, IDK I am just so confused. I know I did NOT love this book but because of certain scenes I can't say I HATE this book, because I did cry and smile sometimes. So I am stuck in between. But I can say that Will and Emory deserved SO MUCH BETTER....
