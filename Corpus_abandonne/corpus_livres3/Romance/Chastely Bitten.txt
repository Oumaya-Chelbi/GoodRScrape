So I read this one as A-the whole idea behind this series really intrigued my sense of curiosity: its just such an imaginative endeavour and B-I signed up to Arc read the next in this series and it's always better to start at the beginning and in this case no hardship at all as this was just fantastic reading.This was a dark dystopian read: A world in the future where Vampires and Lycanthropes are now top of the food chain and humans are cattle: without any rights whatsoever and solely reduced to property totally at there masters will.Juliet because of her unique bloodline is a blood slave: raised with a single purpose to serve a highborn master for however short a time that may be.With her unique addictive flavour, these humans are the cream of the crop and sell for top dollar.Purchased at auction by a new master with his own hidden agenda: Darius has a special assignment in place for his new blood slave.Dark, dirty and decadent 'Chastely Bitten' was such an intense experience and at times I felt a deep sense of dread down to the bottom of my very soul.The pathetically short and horrendous lives these humans get to live out well death actually seemed like a small mercy offered up in comparison to there ongoing suffering.So this was narrated in dual Pov which I do prefer.Darius out of the two was the one I took longer to warm up to mainly because of his end game which involved using Juliet to accomplish his hidden agenda.There were times he was so single-minded and coldly focused on his goals even to the detriment of Juliet's own personal safety that I struggled to like him.Though I did get why he was this way as the importance of his agenda and the role he expected Juliet to play was bigger than his own wants and needs: it still was hard to take his disregard though.Juliets confusion as she tries to overcome her conditioning while still at times having to portray an outward role for the benefit of others perusal was expected.She is no longer a simple sheep but starting to think for herself which is entirely Darius's intention but he really wants her willing cooperation in these things and not just her blind obedience.It's understandable that she struggles to some degree with this after years of indoctrination at the hands of her masters.So there were some scenarios here that I wasn't much a fan of namely the blood sharing of Juliet.It's for a reason other than just pure gratification so even though I didn't like it personally: I could still deal somewhat.This was also as you would expect quite dark in places in regards to the current ongoing practices employed by the supernaturals towards the humans.In my opinion, this is a great start to this series: there's an underground rebellion of the current system underway and I am ever so interested to see in what direction this is heading.This really did set the stage brilliantly for future story progression a great read that I am happy to recommend.Reviewed By Beckie Bookwormhttps://www.facebook.com/beckiebookworm/www.beckiebookworm.comMerged review:This is a fabulous dark dystopian paranormal Fiction.Set in a future world controlled by vampires where humans are the bottom of the food chain.This two book series really is a great read that I highly recommend.Well written and imaginative with exceptional world-building this is one series that stands out for all the right reasons.If you want a more in-depth idea of what this is all about you can check out my lengthier reviews for the two titles here.https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...
