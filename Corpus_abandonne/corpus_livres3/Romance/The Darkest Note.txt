“I think it’s easier to choose darkness than light.” I play the dark keys to prove my point. “That way, rather than being hurt, you’re the one doing the hurting.”...I did NOT expect to enjoy this book as much as i did!! 😍Like, seriously. I had ZERO expectations 😂, the plot did originally sound pretty good and I’ve been in a MAJOR reading slump for a while, so I was like, sure why not.BUT DAMN DID THIS BOOK EXCEED MY EXPECTATIONS ENTIRELY!!! 😍So, we start off with Dutch, Zane and Finn. The three brothers who have their own band called ‘The Kings’ (I know, cliché much? 😂) They’re the ultimate popular dominating kings of Redwood Prep.Cadence is a pianist and scholarship student at Redwood Prep who suffers from traumatic stage fright.She's been raising her little sister ever since her mother committed suicide and conceals her real identity with her alter ego persona, Soprano. As soon as Dutch sees Cadence under the disguise of her alter ego he’s immediately attracted to not only her, but her music.But he has NO clue that Sonata is actually Cadey.In order to save his best friend, Sol, from rehab and bring him back to Redwood Prep, Dutch forms a plan to bully Cadey into leaving the school, since she’s taken the scholarship position that Sol had before he was expelled.In comes the ENEMIES TO LOVERS!!!!! 😍THE VERY REASON AS TO WHY THIS IS A FIVE STARS!!!THIS WAS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED FROM AN ENEMIES TO LOVERS TROPE!!!I freaking LOVED the tension and dynamic between Cadey and Dutch!!!!Cadey is such a badass independent queen who will literally not take shit from ANYONE. She refuses to listen to Dutch and fights him EVERY step of the way. Even till the end, the attraction towards each other was more of complete anger and hate rather than love.Duke on the other hand is brooding and closed off. We aren’t really given a back story for Duke, but it’s pretty obvious that he’s had some sort of shitty upbringing. He’s a possessive and dark character.The musical references were what put the icing on the cake for me. I loved how the author used musical theory and composition to enhance the writing style. The chords used for different climax’s were perfectly placed and created an AMAZING aesthetic. 😍“People evolve. I don’t see why music can’t either. Music is a reflection of us. Of who we are, where we come from and who we want to be.” “It’s also a measure of perfection. If we don’t play it exactly right, we don’t win.” I scrunch my nose. “I think our obsession with holding on to things, trying to preserve them so they’re exactly the way they always were, can keep us from seeing what’s important.”...BUT THE ENDING!!!HOLY CRAP THAT ENDING!!! 😍I am SO here for the twist of revenge that’s happening now. I’m rooting for Cadey all the FUCKING WAY!!Cadey and Duke both think that the other person has betrayed them, and boy are they hell bent in getting their revenge...“the broken shards that linger in the depths of my soul, scattered from years of living with pain and heartache, comes alive. A snake rising from smoke. The chaos in me gets louder. Wilder. I’m out for blood tonight. And I’m going to take that pound of flesh”...And we can’t forget about Jinx.
