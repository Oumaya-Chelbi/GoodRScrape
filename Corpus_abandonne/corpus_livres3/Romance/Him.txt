⭐32 “highly unpopular opinion” stars ⭐Edit: rating adjusted becauseI keep disliking this more as time passes.This is one ofthose classics(of the MM genre, at least) that everyone and their aunties have read by now. So saying it’s beloved by many would bequite an understatement.With that being said...This is gonna be me after dropping this32 star review.*******************Before everyone goes secure their pitchforks,I must clarify this was shaping up to earn 4 stars for thefirst two hundred pages or so.I was having a great time, getting a taste of the feels, and progressively falling in love with the main couple. For that section of the story, all the hype seemed completely warranted to me.But then those last hundred pages or so hit and...'Twas the mood for me.In order to be completely fair, I will now divide this review into two sections, acknowledgingthe parts I enjoyed (no spoilers)and thoseI clearly didn’t (spoilers present)Without further ado...THE GOOD(And why I can understand the reason so many people adored the book)— The MC Jaime.When the story first picks up, we find out that Jaime isstillhurting after being abandoned by his once best friend,Wes,forfour whole years.His POV allows us to experience firsthand the pain the loss caused him, the grief mingled with confusion at not only the disappearance of someone who meant the world to him, but the lack of closure as well (keeping in mind that Wes, in true dastardly fashion, decided tocut the guy out of his life abruptly and without explication).For me personally, the fact that Jaime could forgive something like that so easilyalready transformed him into a better person than I could ever be—Although I did believe Wes should've doneat least a little groveling, but I digress.The truth here was that I did not only appreciate Jaime as a romantic lead, but as the kind of personI would genuinely love to have as a friend or partner(because hey, dreaming is free). I became so attached to the guy by the end of the book, he could have drop-kicked a toddler on-page and my reaction would've been "My god, he's good with kids too 😍"So to sum up my impressions of the guy...Anyone:*even looks at Jaime the wrong way*Me:Is this foreshadowing for a later part of the review?You'll have to find out.—Believable friendship dynamic (which was nicely incorporated into the romance)My god, friends-to-lovers is my crack of choice… so you bet I was eating up the banter and camaraderieas if it was the most savory of banquets.The two MCs had tons of chemistry when it came to the romantic side, but it wasthose goofy moments that could only come from years of friendshipthat truly got to me.An underlying ease between them was a major characteristic for most of the book, the sort which made long stretches of silence comfortable rather than awkward. With inside jokes (I will never be able to look at purple skittles the same) and anecdotes aplenty, these details served to cementjust how much of a shared history and connection they had.If any two characters could start and finish each other's sentences without being cheesy, then Jaime and Wes might very well be one of the examples that come to mind.Some quotes to point out their charming brand of foolishness:“Wes cackles. “Tell you what—let’s make a deal. It’s been a while since I had a steak dinner. You find me a steak, and I’ll subject myself to this concert.”“Here, man.” I pretend to unbutton my fly.”Did I mention they were idiots too? And goofy as hell? Well,they were.And I absolutely loved that.Me everytime the Banter™ kicked in. They were of thelovable varietythough.Another example of their sage convos:“Yeah? Hit me. What’s good about going gay?” I nudge him back under the table.“Well, dicks,” he says. “Obvs.”“Obvs.”I mean...Cold hard facts courtesy of Wes and Jamie.However, it could also be said that it was that same bond that made thesubsequent separation and miscommunication all the harsher. And the choice of acertain MC pulling a Houdini for the second timeeven more jarring.(Can you all by now sense I'm pissed off at any one particular character? Whose name might or might notrhyme withMess?)Anyway, moving on…— The take on sports.As someone with absolutely zero previous knowledge, I was surprised at howpalatable I found all the side plots and scenes revolving around hockey. Now, don't go quizzing me on the sport because I wouldstillfail miserably, but the fact that I could muster any kind of interest is probably a testament to how well the topic was handled.Plus, it was compelling to read about Wes and Jaime'sdiffering views and feelings on the subject.While Wes was immensely passionate and had his eyes firmly set on a professional career, we witness Jaime's heart beginning to stray from his original dreams of athletic stardom. The discovery part of this story, you could say,went vastly beyond just his sexuality.And it was comments like the ones below which I most appreciated too, giving a nuanced glimpse into the harsh reality of an athlete's lifethat defied the glamorized image most of us perhaps have:“When I was a kid I collected hockey cards. They came in packs of ten with a lousy piece of gum that tasted awful. In every pack there’d be one good player—hopefully not a duplicate of a card I already had—and nine guys you’d never heard of.Those nine went in the bottom of my shoebox, where they waited. Every once in a blue moon one of those guys would rise in the ranks, but usually they didn’t.Fast forward ten years. To my agent,I’m one of those cards at the bottom of the shoebox.”While realistic in the context,it was still heartbreaking to read.—Wes' goofiness.Ok, those of you who are masterful in the art of reading between the lines (becausesubtlety is my specialty, obvs) have probably realized by now thatWes wasn't exactly my favorite.Yet I couldn’t list the positives of this book and not comment on this man's absurdly entertaining thoughts.From his terrible puns:“Hell. I was like the serpent shoving the apple at Eve.Or rather the banana...”Wes' inner monologue was so ridiculous it was gold.To this kind of skillful analogies:“Swimming with a hard-on is extremely difficult. But maybe I should be thinking of my stiffy as a floatation device. Or an oar, because God knows it’s long and hard enough to single-handedly propel an entire fucking canoe.”Shakespeare could never.On a real note…Y'all cannot convince Wes was not the kid laughing whenever the teacher in health class said "penis".It is a fact I simply refuse to be challenged on.—The refreshing way some side characters were handled.Namely Jaime’s family and ex-girlfriend Holly.I was surprised byhow accepting and understanding they were, and I have to applaud both authors for not taking the easy way out and utilizing them as plot devices for drama, instead portraying a healthy and heartwarming dynamic.With Holly in particular, getting to witness the transition into a friendship with Jaime wasnothing short of extraordinary for me, considering the many evil and cartoonish exes I’ve encountered in my years as a romance reader. And particularly female ones, because this genre sure loves trivializing a women’s role despite a considerable number of the writers being women themselves —but oh well,that’s a discussion for another day…All I will add is that this really is how some authors end up presenting the entirety of the female gender🥴Switching gears now,let me finally elaborate on the juicy part of this review—and the reasons tempting me to buy a fake passport and lay low for a while…The Not So GreatWARNING:I'll try to keep things mostly vague, but since most of my issues are tied to the ending,spoilers will be discussed.🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨—The miscommunication.What started off as cute and believable for me, since Jaime and Wes were old friends reconnecting after all, grewconcerningonce I realized I was on page 200 and these two guyshadn't had any real conversation about their feelings.In fact, said convo only took place aboutthree chapters before the epilogue(and was initiated by Jaime pursuing West to a whole different country, mind you). So not only was this miscommunication, but an acute case of"are you two even speaking the same language?"Indeed, as much as I originally liked them as a couple and loved their easy camaraderie, there was a point whereI just wanted to smack them and tell them…But then again,we wouldn't have a book if that was the case.Because seriously,ALLthe conflicts in this story ended up beingwrapped up with about a page or so worth of dialogues. And, as earnest as I was to finally read their long-awaited heart-to-heart, it was still appalling to realize that the entire bookdangled on these two grown men's inability to phrase their feelings.But speaking ofnot getting it…—Wes' pining miserably failing to translate into actions.(And me addressing my issues with the fella.)At first, one of my highlights of the story was getting towitness Wes's years-long crush on Jaime coloring his view of the guy.Whenever his beloved popped up, Wes turned into a lovesick puppy and it just made my romantic heart all mushy inside.It's on his inner thoughts that we get to comprehend his emotions,reading heart-squeezing moments like this:“Now I’m grinning in the dark. I hold him as close as I dare. Even if my entire life goes to shit before breakfast, I’ll always have this night.”And then:“Either way, my heart won’t be in it. My heart is back in Lake Placid. Or maybe in California.It goes wherever Jaime Canning goes.”You get a sense of the fragility he masks, the depth of his love for Jaime, and how desperate he is for just one extra moment with what he refers to as the love of his life.Or so we are told.When it comes down to Westactuallytelling Jaime any of that, or making any kind of gesture to give Jaime the impression that he truly cares?Zero. Zilch. Zip.So that's what I mean by the pining not translating. Much as I enjoyed getting a peek inside Wes' head and experiencing his adoration that way,it ultimately felt unrewarding.As in love as he was,it always ended up being Jaime the one who pursued things.It was him who ultimately asked Wes to be together once he moved to Toronto, and even sought a coaching job there after realizing the career path he wanted to take —selecting that specific cityto be closer to his best friend and lover, mind you.Wes' response when the subject was breached?He decided to spinelessly break it all up, cut ties once more, andflee without even bothering with a farewell, because he was too busy presuming Jaime only thought of it all as a "summer fling" and would instantly forget about him andgo back to girls.(but I'll be elaborating on that last bit later.)In summary, it felt like Jaime kept reaching out, opening up, offering his heart on a silver platter, andWes was too busy sticking his head up his ass to even acknowledge it.Because sure, Wes was in love…in his head.But when you're 220 pages in and the "love of your life" is being abandoned and left to wonder if he ever meant anything at all to you? I don't want that kind of love myself,thank you very much.And since I'm already talking about the guy,I might as well mention another major pet peeve…—Wes invalidating Jaime's identity. (And welcome to the hottest of takes, everyone.)This guy kept insisting again and again that Jaime would either leave him andgo back to womenor, even in the very last chapter,implying Jaime felt like he was missing out by dating another man.Despite his partner telling him on various occasions that he was in love, enjoyed being together, and was already secure in the fact that he was attracted toboth men AND women.I understood having doubts initially, bearing in mind how Jaime was his first official boyfriend and theonly guy Wes ever loved, but past a certain pointit started to become a pattern.Wes' fears went beyond just mere insecurities and turned into toxic assumptions, showcasing that not only did he not fully trust his boyfriend, but also thought his sexuality was a passing fancy —Which was especially ironic, considering how Wes' bigoted parentshad also hurt him by spewing similar nonsense his way.(I also get this might not annoy everyone, but for me it was a major turn-off.)Examples of this behavior from Wes' POV:(Page 260, by which point Wes had ended things himself and decided to abandon Jaimewithout any parting words.)“The Hollys of the world are waiting to take him back.Some cute girl will catch his eye before the week is through, and a few months from now, today’s disaster will be just a bad memory.”Because bisexuality totally works like that.You get one (1) crush on someone of the same gender and then go back to being straight right the very next second…By this point and after several of his dismissals of Jaime’s orientation,Wes had begun to get on my nerves.Yet that's not all, folks.As 21st-century philosopher DJ Khalef would say,another one:(Happened on page 285, after Jaime had assured Wes he was interested in both sexes, already gifted him sentimental gifts and even took the man on a whole ass date.)“You think I’m just going to—” He brushes his hands together as if dusting them off. “—go back to girls. Chalk this up as an experiment.”Yeah, I think that, too.”Truly, all I could do was…And then the culmination of it all,when the issue was finally breached:(Page 311, by which point Jaime and Wes had already exchanged I Love You's, were an official couple, and had been living together for months.)“He gives me a weak grin. “Sure. But…”“But what?”“Well,I’ll never be able to give you everything you like.”So yeah, perhaps I might be exaggerating, but as someone who shares an identity with Jaime and has heard that kind of talk in plenty of previous relationships? Call it a subjective nitpick or me being overly sensitive,but it personally annoyed the hell out of me and detracted from my enjoyment.Because it wasn't simply about Wes' fears anymore, about the unloved child of neglectful parents not recognizing affection if it hit him squarely in the face (which was why I let it slide in the beginning), but abouthis stubborn refusal of embracing Jaime's sexuality and his lingering lack of faith in the guy.As if just because he was attracted to more than one gender that meant he was more likely to leave him or tire of him… when I need to stress again,Wes had been the person to bail on both their friendship and romantic liaison two times by that point.So yeah, @ Wes:*******************But listen, even with my slightly rant-ish points,I still don't regret giving this book a try.Although again, I rarely do with books, since I believe thateven a bittersweet experience can be enriching.Besides, if I were to erase those issues I had… the book wasmostlyenjoyable.And bottom line,I'm pretty sure I will give the sequel a try down the line.If only because I adored Jaime as an MC and look forward to the relationshipactually developing on equal terms and with what I hope is a shared sense of trust.Fingers crossed, folks.*******************Him series by Sarina Bowen and Elle KennedyHim — 3 ⭐Us — TBR.Epic — TBR.
