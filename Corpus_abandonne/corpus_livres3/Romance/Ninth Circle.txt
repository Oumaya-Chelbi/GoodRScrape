My reviews always contain spoilers, I write them so I can remember the story.This is book was a real roller coaster, you get pov from almost all of the major characters. The heroine Alyssa is a real psychopath or is it sociopath? I think it’s probably both, Garrett her future husband is really no better. The book starts with Alyssa returning home early from a business trip where she signed a huge deal for her company with Garrett‘s company. This is the first time that they meet. She picks up a fancy celebratory dinner for her and her fiancé Denny only to find him in bed with her best friend Sherry’s little sister, Lacey.At the age of eight Alyssa‘s world was rocked when her parents divorced. The divorce was due to infidelity on her dad‘s part so she has always hated cheaters. She literally conditioned herself to deal with future cheating from her boyfriend and husband, so she was completely prepared when she found Denny having sex with Lacey in their bed, she calmly finished the dinner then went upstairs, dragged their mattress downstairs into the backyard and literally lit it on fire. During all of this Denny and Lacey leave.Her brothers come over to try to keep her calm, but she talks them into leaving her for the evening saying she’s fine. She then heads over to her dad Corbin’s house and proceeded to smack him around with a baseball bat, smack his affair partner turned wife, Helen and threatened her daughter, Mitzie, who was forced by Helen to compete with Alyssa for her father’s affection.She breaks her engagement to Denny, cuts off Sherry and decides she’s going to turn her destination wedding in Cabo into just a family reunion. Little does she know that Garrett is thrilled that she’s no longer engaged and shows up in Cabo where he owns a house and proceeds to propose to her. It was love at first sight when Garrett saw Alyssa at the business meeting, he’s never had this feeling ever before, he is obsessed with her. He’s always been about his business so he knew she was the one for him when he can’t stop thinking of her. He was going to do whatever was needed to get her.After spending the day together, he convinces her to marry him. He promises to always have her back and never cheat on her. The rest of the book is pretty much all the crazy escapades that happen during Alyssa‘s need for revenge against: Denny, Lacey, her stepmother, her dad who she’s never forgiven, and Mitzie. After she married Garrett, Natalie, Garrett’s ex is also added to the revenge list when she alludes to the fact that Alyssa is just a gold digger, and she married Garrett for his money. Our little sociopath has started to fall in love with her crazy husband and is hurt when he defends Natalie and doesn’t say anything about her gold digger comment. He apologizes and they have make up sex. (Their sex in general was always so violent.)Garrett supports Alyssa in her revenge plot, actually provides even more resources for her since he’s a billionaire. Anytime he questions her methods she pretty much threatens his life or tells him she will divorce him. And this crackpot loves it. Cue more violent sex.You get POV from Denny and how his life is completely gone out of control, you get POV from Helen, who doesn’t understand where she went wrong, all she wanted was a better life for herself and her daughter Mitzie, when she trapped Corbin into marrying her. You find out in the very end of the book that Corbin never cheated with Helen. Helen made the whole thing up after drugging Corbin.Quick backstory on the perceived cheating Gigi, Alyssa‘s mom was suffering from serious postpartum depression after having four kids in 10 years and Corbin, so busy with work never realized how terrible her mental health had become. A dead bedroom for five years, leads to an emotional affair with Helen, which during a drunk/drugged night, Helen pretended it was an actual cheating affair. Sadly that fuels Alyssa’s rage that leads to all of these other issues and the author never addresses it at the end. It would’ve been so great for Gigi to know that Corbin never really did cheat on her because it is brought up that they were each other’s one and only, and knowing that he cheated causes Gigi so much more mental anguish. Although these two are crazy too after a couple years, Corbin and Gigi talk and decide they’re gonna try and get back together again after Corbin tells him Helen threatened Alyssa and her if he didn’t stay with her so they get Corbin on some medication that helps keep his libido low and Corbin during the 15 years that he is married to Helen never has sex with her. About 10 years these two have been seeing each other. They go on business trips together and spend holidays together, but they never have sex either. See crazy roller coaster ride!Back to Alyssa and Garrett they go to visit his family in California and she’s going to give Natalie a verbal smack down. Only the smack happens to Natalie‘s little boy. Natalie is still obsessed with Garrett and very unhappy in her marriage and physically abuses her little son. Neither Alyssa or Garrett can stand any kind of abuse to a child and gather evidence of her abuse and get her away from her son.Alyssa is pregnant and scared of PPD like her mom, but Garrett has all the best doctors ready to treat her for any issues that can arise. She’s now good friends with Mitzie who Garrett sent to rehab and a school were she learned to be a hair stylist.Last chapter was about Natalie and Lyon and his crew taking “care” of her.Ok rides over 🤣. The book was very entertaining, these people are all crazy and all deserve each other. There are dozens of other things that happen to every character that I didn’t even touch on.
