⁺˚⋆｡° ♥️This girl isn’t the Queen of Hearts, but the Devil in disguise. Unfortunately, I can’t say for sure I wouldn’t follow her into hell.🎲°｡⋆˚⁺-ˏˋ4.25 ☆ˊˎ-Wow. Such a good surprise. After reading the first book and being really disappointed with it, I wasn’t expecting this! I am shocked over my current obsession with these two!If i’m sinking to the bottom, at least her voice will keep me company on the way down.╰┈➤ 9 years ago a cartomancer told Raphael to choose between the king of diamonds or the king of hearts, and he chose business over love. But his reading foresees a doom card where a red head will bring him down to his knees and crumble his empire. Fast forward to the present when Rafe meets the lucky Penny who swindles him from his watch and later comes to work for him. Amidst wild banter and games the tension between the two rises while Raphael’s empire slowly falls, all because of his doomed Queen of Hearts.What you’re signing up for:💋 Mafia romance🃏 Enemies to lovers vibes♥️ Boss x Employee🔪 Touch her and die♦️ Age gap🎲 Slowest of burnsYou know when you read a book that objectively isn’t the best but then gives you all the butterflies and feels, makes you giggle uncontrollably and gasp over the faintest of touches? Yep, this is that book for me! I don’t think it has the best plot but the romance has me in a chokehold!!“You sure are persistent for a man that isn’t interested.” His gaze drops to my mouth.“Oh, I’m interested.”I don’t think it’s a true enemies to lovers but it gives off those vibes and angsty banter so well! From literally the first scene when Penny swindles Rafe their connection is off the charts! Ughhhh and then all the little games they played and bets they made accompanied by the best banter just to try and one up each other!!! 😩Intensity done well!!I swear they had the best interactions! And the slow burn is scrumptious!!! The way Somme writes the scenes with the best kind of sexual tension without nothing even happening is gold! I was sweating over a few grazes and heated glances, I can’t even describe it. They are so hot and have the best chemistry ever!!!That car scene IYKYK 🥵🥵“Bet you’ll kiss me first.”“Bet you a million dollars my lips would never touch yours first.”“You don’t have a million dollars.”“Doesn’t matter, because I’m not going to lose.”𐙚—♥️Pennyis such a great character. Nothing like annoying Rory from the first book! She has a dark past but is still so strong and striving to do her best and keep her head above water. She’s feisty, bratty, mouthy, sexy and has the best comebacks!“Why do you care if I cry?”“Because last night, I saw you laugh.”𐙚—🎲RAPHAEL VISCONTI!!!!Oh my gosh, I’m in love! Instantly obsessed! Unlike his brothers he doesn’t get his hands bloodied because he’s a gentleman, unless it comes to her! Because he doesn’t act like a gentleman around her and if someone even looks at her the wrong way he’s not afraid to get blood on his hands!“Just because I'm a gentleman, Penelope, doesn't always mean I'm a gentle man.”Ughhh he’s just so hot with all his smirking and sarcasm!He makes the simplest thing look like the hottest thing ever!(talking specifically when he demonstrated verynotsexually how to open a champagne bottle! Deceased was my status after reading that! 🫠)AND HIS MOUTH, don’t even!!“Strip for another man again, and he’ll die crossing the road.”The plot could be so much better though! Just like with the first book there’s a lot of potential, especially after how things ended but nothing much is done with that. I just wish there was a better balance between plot and romance. If I wasn’t so invested in the characters this would’ve been a miss.“Or maybe I just want to see you shut your dick in a car door.”“Or maybe you just want to see my dick.”And for the part that really grates my nerves:why the hell did the author completely change the plot with Penny and Rafe from the first book to this one?Let me explain. In the last chapter of Sinners anonymous Angelo sees a red head who’s doing a terrible job at being a waitress and approaches her to fire her, she tries to run and in comes Rafe. Even though they don’t say her name it’s made pretty obvious from the interactions between them that it’s Penny. And besides this Angelo says she’s the one who sold him the fortune cookie.And then in the second book this whole plot is erased and swapped.I understand that after writing it maybe the author wanted to write a different first meeting, but she could still’ve done that and still have this scene! Honestly I think it could’ve been even better in some ways. I was so annoyed because I was waiting for it and it never came. And what pissed me off even more was the fact that she and Angelo apparently never met. Ugh it could’ve been such an interesting plot. I was able to look past it and still love the book, but I still wanted to address this massive plot hole because I never see anyone talking about it. I mean, is my book different?Also, I don’t understand why this is a duet. If there was a plot that needed development or something happened between them I could’ve understood the decision for it.But there isn’t even a cliffhanger!!!Still, this is such an amazing romance, that’ssure to leave you ultimately yearning for more in the end!~♛♡︎˚. ─── 🂽 ─── .˚♡︎♛~series ranking:1.Sinners condemned2.Sinners consumed3.Sinners anonymous~♛♡︎˚. ─── 🂽 ─── .˚♡︎♛~Ok why was this so good?
