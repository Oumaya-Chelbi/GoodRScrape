SIZZLING, SENSUAL, SUSPENSEFULI am a self-proclaimed Stoni Alexander addict and proud of it. I was introduced to her as an author when I bought IN LIKE SIN. I became addicted to her books from that story on. Now Stoni has created a second series called the Vigilantes and VENGEANCE is the second in that series.This book centers on the two main characters, Danielle, and Cooper. Both characters have suffered severe loss and experience deep grief and anger. But Danielle and Cooper have completely different ways to deal their losses. There is also a complicated subplot about missing women which makes this book a “one-sitting” read. In other words, you will be unable to put this book down once you start to read it! I couldn’t!This book can be read as an individual story My suggestion, though, is that you read the first in the series, DAMAGED, first. It, too, is so engrossing you won’t be able to stop! Many of the characters from that book continue into VENGEANCE and I found it very helpful. I liked the continuity.I do suggest that you read the first in the series, DAMAGED, first.

I liked the continuity.Take my advice and read VENGEANCE. You will fall in love with Stoni Alexander as fast as I did! It’s available on Kindle Unlimited too!
