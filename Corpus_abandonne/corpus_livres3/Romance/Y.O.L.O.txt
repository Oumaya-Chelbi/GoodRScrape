i decided to reread this one bc i reread the class prince and i remember liking this one too so i thought i’d go again! and tbh they are veeeery similar books, more so than i initially thought, again the mature chapter was not on wattpad and i would’ve had to pay to read it along with the sequel with is annoying as usualllll, tbh it’s good but similarly to the class prince it really needed to be a slower burn and more dragged out, near the end i felt like their relationship was kinda just thrown together and there wasn’t really enough development time,i’m only pointing out the bad bits here though lol obviously it was still a 4 star book that i would read again but if it were to ever be published i would hope that it gets a bit of editing to make it longer and more developed!
