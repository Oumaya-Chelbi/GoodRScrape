LANA MYERS is my new HERO.She is such a strong girl that I couldn’t help but admire her.She is a survivor.A survivor of rape.And not a rape by one personbut by 12 people!Yes 12 sick fucks raped her and her brother over and over all night.Tortured them, cut them, beat them and did all the unimaginable things to themand in the end,they were left to die, bleeding in the streets of the town...How do you survive that? How do you survive that without losing your soul?*********************************************It took Lana Myers years and years to heal and become the fierce girl that she is now. And now she is ready to collect the debts…One by one.In exactly the same painful ways that they did.She has a long list.Not just 12 people… but all the helpers.And the ones who stayed silent.And also the ones who took their father away from themby putting a blame on him – a crime that he never committed.As I said, she has a long list!*********************************************While going through her list with the help of her best friend Jake, who is a technology genius, Lana meets a man – Logan. He is an FBI agent. And he is the one who is working on the serial killer case, trying to find the murderer who is torturing men and killing them in unspeakable ways.Lana is feeling love for the first time in years and she cannot get away. She immerses herself in the pleasure and happiness Logan gives her, all the while knowing that he is a good person and will never be OK with what she is doing.Her love for Logan grounded her in a way. He brought out the human side of her, which was necessary between all those killings so that she didn't lose her soul totally.*********************************************All 5 books are perfect, except for a few grammar/editing mistakes. But never mind them, these books are awesome anyways.*********************************************All 5 of them are told in dual point of view but one book had a third person’s point of view.*********************************************They are all short, around 100 pages. Only the last book is 160 pages.*********************************************These books are like an addiction. Once you start, you cannot drop them. I read them all breathless. They are so good, indeed. And it was refreshing to see the sick rapists are punished in delicious ways.Normally, I try to avoid books that contain rape as it is too painful to read them unless they are recommended strongly by people who know me well. In this case,my dear friend Sanzidainsisted that I should read this series and she said they were amazing.I was a coward for a long time and she had to remind me more than a few times that I should pick up some courage and read them. She knows me - she knows me so well – otherwise, she would never have insisted about a book where a girl was brutally violated if she weren't so sure I would love them. So special thanks to my dear friend… I loved them lots! And I love you lots :)*********************************************The writer of these books is using the pen name S.T. Abby. She is the same writer who also uses the pen name C.M. Owens.The pen name S.T. Abby fits these books very well as it reads “stabby” and Lana is definitely a stabby heroine :)I also would like to thank the writer for printing the past memories all in italics. In this way, if you want to skip the too painful parts, you can. Personally, I surprised myself and read them all. Knowing she is also torturing them now helped me to be able to read those parts.*********************************************I know these books are hard to read but believe me it is worth the pain, they are amazing. She doesn’t only kill her rapists – the mindf*ckery in it is genius and so very delicious. I enjoyed every minute of it.If you can stomach some pain, then the reward is good.These books are so many things at the same time: painful, sad, funny, entertaining, emotional, hot, brutal, scary, twisted and much more.*********************************************If you want justice no matter what and if you are OK with someone handling the justice herself where justice didn’t work in normal ways, then read them. See how one tiny girl rains down vengeance for herself and her family.The side characters in the book are very well portrayed, too. They each contribute to the story a lot. I loved Hadley and Jake fiercely. I also loved Leonard. I can say I loved the hero Logan too although I was pissed at him for a while for how he treated our girl but my real hero in this book is LANA MYERS.*********************************************RATING of all 5 books:I am giving all books in this series 5 stars butI am deducting 0,5 point from the last bookbecause of its ending. I didn’t like the Epilogue and how it ended.Don’t worry, there is a happy end but there is also something I didn’t like and personally I believe that it was not necessary. Everything she did up to that moment was justified in my eyes because it was her personal revenge but I cannot tell the same for the things mentioned in the Epilogue.I cannot say more. You’ll see yourself if you read them and decide if you like it or not. I didn't - but still, I think these books are amazing and I cannot give them anything but 5.*********************************************Here are some QUOTES from them all…BOOK 1: THE RISK - 5 starsI can’t help but wonder how things might have been if my past hadn’t been derailed and cluster-fucked to hell and back. I think he would have really liked the old me. I was clever, funny, quick-witted, and slightly dramatic. I also cried if I accidentally killed a bug.Now…Now I’m a 5’4 package of vengeance that no one sees coming.BOOK 2: SIDETRACKED - 5 stars“No one cared. No one wanted to listen. No one wanted to be bothered with something so horribly, inconceivably evil. They wanted to pretend it just didn’t exist.”***I’m his girlfriend.I have a boyfriend.This isn’t news, but it’s still making me gush like a thirteen-year-old who is hovering over the phone. I don’t even think about the fact he’s the guy trying to catch the killer I moonlight as.BOOK 3: SCARLET ANGEL - 5 starsTo defeat a monster, you have to be twice as monstrous. To love a monster, you have to share your soul.If you prick us, do we not bleed?If you tickle us, do we not laugh?If you poison us, do we not die?And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?-William ShakespeareShakespeare was one of the few philosophers who believed in revenge. Then again, he was a romantic. Romantics always believe in revenge, because romantics love harder, suffer loss more painfully, and hold onto a grudge that has shattered their hearts.BOOK 4: ALL THE LIES - 5 starsEvery man is guilty of all the good he did not do.-Voltaire***I grow quiet, thinking of all the contradictions this unsub has left us with. It all fits, and none of it fits at the same time.***As of this morning, they no longer fear the sheriff. Now they fear the one person who can break the untouchable. They belong to me now. The flock have a new shepherd to fear. Baa, bitches.Jake was right. Logan never would have chosen me. He just proved it. He didn’t even ask. He didn’t even care.***The worst thing he could do is what he’s doing now. Silencing me. It was the worst part of it all. Being silenced, because no one wanted to hear. Now the one person I’ve opened myself up enough to love is silencing me.BOOK 5 - PAINT IT ALL RED– 4.5 stars rounded up to 5 because I am deducting 0.5 point for how it ended in the Epilogue.My mind feels like it’s gone through a mind-fuck blender. Up is down. Right is left. Good is bad.***“We’re claiming this town now. For your sins, you shall repent. For your past, you shall endure the nightmares you caused. And for your eyes that you closed so willingly, now you shall see.”***Any demon is capable of cruelty, but only an angel is majestic enough to rain down vengeance for the innocent.**** You can followmy instagram page from here
