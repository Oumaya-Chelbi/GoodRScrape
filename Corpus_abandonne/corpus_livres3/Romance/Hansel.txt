Hansel I didn’t mean to say the words; they just fell out of my mouth. And the moment I said them, I wished I could take them back. I was angry at her, and she was always angry at me. We had wanted to hurt each other. That was why the words came screaming out of my mouth. And I knew... I just knew that I had gone too far. The way she recoiled from me was a punch to the gut. I tried, I really tried to form the words to make her believe I hadn’t meant it. But by then it was too late. The front door had already slammed shut behind her. I knew it was the end of our marriage, the end of the life we had always dreamt of having with one another. The end of me and her. One sentence and my life imploded before my eyes. And now she is back and embroiled in a dangerous game of cat and mouse with a killer. And she’s firmly on his radar… the worst thing though? The killer just might be someone we know. Who am I meant to trust, if I can’t trust, my brothers in The Savage Sons? I won’t fail her though, not ever again. When this is all over, she will be mine again and this time I won’t be letting her go. It’s time we got our happily ever after.
