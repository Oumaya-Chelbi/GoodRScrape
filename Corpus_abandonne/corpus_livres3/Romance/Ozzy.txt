This is the third book of the Black Roses MC and follows the MMC the Black MC’s President Ozzy.This is a stand-alone/interconnected book. You don’t need to have read the previous two to read this, you get a little more understanding on side characters if you have read the previous books.Ozzy owes a favour and when that’s called in the last thing he expects it to be is to provide protection to his ex gf, an ex gf he hasn’t seen in 15 years. Not since she was shot at the clubhouse when she was 18 and broke his heart when she left town and refused to speak to him.The FMC Freya has spent her life working to put bad men behind bars. Her determination and drive has been to make the man who shot her at 18 pay for his actions. Just happens that he is the head of the Italian mafia. She knows this time she has him. She’s going to win her case, it’s ironclad. The issue is the men that came knocking on her door and threatening her with their fists as the trial approaches.Freya doesn’t want to run and hide but she can’t risk not being around to win this case, even if that means relying on the man who broke her heart and left a whole she’s never been able to fill.I really enjoyed this book, Ozzy is a strong MC President, he’s sensible and driven, he’s just exhausted with the the responsibility of paperwork and life making him feel like he’s missing something.Freya is a strong, driven women who knows she was never given the closure she needed from the love of her life but right in the middle of her biggest trial of her career while she’s being threatened isn’t the best timing.I enjoyed that even though there was a lot of trial speak and the trial itself it wasn’t dragged out.This book was about content, drama and story rather than trying to fluff out with pages. I don’t feel like anything was skipped over or too quick but at the same time things weren’t dragged out with information that didn’t aid in the story.The only thing that stopped me giving this book 5⭐️ was when I realised that although Freya and Ozzy had been first loves, first everything, they had only been together once.I felt like the connection they had and the strength of it led to them having been together for a longer time (which maybe they had and I missed) or more intimate time with how their strength of need and some of the flashbacks felt like it was downplayed a little which for me didn’t connect with the present. I think that’s being really picky though it was just a tiny thing.That and the British side of the characters, if any more books involve Liam, I really hope a British person is asked on terms, words, language, as a British reader, for me it jumps out that these British characters feel more generalised than actually British. Some of the phrases, words don’t sit right.This was a really good book and having read each book of this series so far I think the writing, the characters, the stories are getting better and stronger and I’m really invested in this MC and look forward to seeing who else’s story we get to see. I’d really love to see Knox’s story! Love a quiet and brooding MC!!Highly recommend this book for any MC lovers like me who like high drama without the prolonged suspense or dragged out words waiting for something to happen.4⭐️4🌶️This is an honest review based on my own opinions on reading this book.*I received this Arc from The Next Step PR*
