Quick reread because I recently readHis Bittersweet Regretand it reminded me of this one. I walked away with a similar reading experience. It’s enjoyable in a trashy/soapy surface read for those that enjoy a drama-llama ride on the HotMess Express. There are too many unexplained/illogical bits to make this a serious read… and I givea lotof leeway for my soapy-train-wrecky reads, so if swoon or safety are concerns… I’d skip. He doesn’t technically cheat, but I suspect it’ll piss SG’ers off.****Original Review*****Free to read with KU, Love Hate & Us follows childhood sweethearts Brody and Brooke as their relationship blows up, and then, as they try to put it back together.This book starts with Brody deciding to break up with his long-time love and fiancé Brook, because they have been together since childhood, and he feels like he’s going to miss out on different experiences. Although I found his reasoning weak/cowardly… I am a believer if free will and all, and could see where one might be nervous had they been shoved together since birth.The couple have an emotional breakup, that I felt pained them both. Then there is a situation with an OW (Joely), and Brooke leaves town. I’m tagging this as cheating-ish for tracking because the hurt is there, but it’s not technically cheating. They had been broken up for a month.This hooked me, and I stayed up late reading it, but more in a “watching the crazy train” way; it was enjoyable as long as I didn’t dig too deep. I liked the secondary characters and found the OTT evil skank entertaining. B & B’s story was pretty much sorted out, but there were some loose ends. I thought she was setting things up for a Cade/Hope book, but this was released in 2017, and there hasn’t been anything yet, so maybe not. My main complaint of the book, is there were inconsistencies throughout the plot that bugged me. I think this was the authors way to tease info, then soften the blow and make us forgive, but it left me confused.The BreakupOriginally, Brody is genuinely conflicted about breaking up, but then he turns into a jerk. Hinting for her to move out and having convo’s cooing to Joely.Afterthe ‘cheating” he tells Joely that he ended because she blackmailed him.BUTthe next page, he says he ended it because his brother called him boring, and he started having doubts about life passing him by.Later, he reflects that he immediately knew the grass wasn’t greener on the single side and wanted Brooke back, but Joely was blackmailing him that she would go to the press if he didn’t pretend to date her 🤷‍♀️Andway back in Ch. 2; he mentions Joely as a “complication”, and that he must clean up his dad’s and bro’s messes.SO….did he break up with Brooke because he was having doubts, or being blackmailed? And why would Joely blackmail him to pretend date her?The CheatingOk, technically they were broken up, but none of it made any sense. The next morning, he can’t remember anything alluding he wasWASTED. He’s shocked that he’s in bed with Joely, he doesn’t remember bringing her home nothing. (She tells him they had sex).BUTthe night before he was walking and talking… and telling her “I want you so bad”. He was coherent enough to talk about protection and remember he no longer slept in the master bedroom which doesn’t really gel with being blackout drunk. Not to mention, it made zero sense that he would bring her to his house and make out with her because he hated her and was being blackmailed. I felt this was a lazy way to upset the h to churn out drama.Bottom line- OK if you like OTT/trashy reads… and can handle H’s making stupid choices to generate drama-llama. The h comes across somewhat immature at times, and parts of the plot are completely unrealistic and inconsistent, but there’s quite a lot of begging on knees, and groveling.Safety- Major SpoilersWe learn early on the OW (Joely) is blackmailing him for money and to break up with Brooke/pretend they’re dating because she slept with his father (and bro) and will tell his mom/go to the press. So we know he never liked her or wanted a relationship with her. At 50%, she informs them (H&h) that they never had sex because the H passed out, and she couldn’t get him up.
