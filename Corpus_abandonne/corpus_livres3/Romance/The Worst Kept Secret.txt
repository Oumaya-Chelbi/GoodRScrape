I had high expectations that were not met 😭 I still enjoyed this though!!The book starting with Theo and Avery already having hooked up really bothered me and tbh I never got over it 🤷🏽‍♀️ I wish we would’ve seen the beginning of them even if their first kiss we did get a flash back and it was only like once/twice before the start of the book but still… I wanted to see them try and fight their attraction just a tiny bit but they fell into bed almost immediately. There was a small “we shouldn’t” “we’re not going the whole way” but 2 minutes later they were like well fuck it!!! 🙄 FULL SEND!I felt like there was sooo much drinking and partying in here and honestly it gave me the ick that they had a party/went out with Theo. I know they’re 21 and JUST graduated buuuuut idk it was weird to me. When I read age gap I like the fmc to be more mature and while Avery was in most aspects, I felt like Theo was written to almost try and fit in with her friends. Going out with each others friends is important in relationships yes but they were hiding it still and the scenarios they were put in just didn’t sit right with me.I don’t understand where she got daddy issues from lmao it’s never mentioned that she had any kind of strain on her & her dads relationship so that was odd. I wish we would’ve gotten to see them tell her dad & Rebecca about them being together.As always with these kinda tropes when all gets out and they have to pick between their SO and child… as a mother I understand and would never pick anyone over my child but in these kind of books it’s just pisses me off 😂😂💀💀 like grow upI read QB Tyler for her smut and taboo relationships and she delivered yet again 🥵 so 3 stars for that 🔥🔥🔥””The guy you’re with…” he starts and when I turn around his eyes drop to my hand, “I don’t see a ring on your finger, so I assume he’s not your husband.”“Not yet.” I hear Theo’s voice from behind me”””“In another life, it would be so easy.”“In another life, I probably don’t live right next door, so maybe we would never cross paths,” she teases.“I’d find you in every lifetime.””
