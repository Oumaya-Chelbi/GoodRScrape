Loved it! This is my kind of read. It was easy to follow, sweet, sexy, had just enough drama and the characters were likeable. Although I do have a few things that I didn’t particularly like. The first is although I loved Viper/Jace’s love for Cara it was REALLY rushed and to be honest it didn’t seem all that realistic. It’s one thing to be infatuated instantly and it is another to be throwing around proclamations of marriage and babies and love to her brother less than a few day after meeting her. The second is although he was very caring during their first time, he never actually asked her if she wanted to use protection. This just didn’t sit right with me. For someone who was so considerate of her feelings it seemed strange that he failed to ask such a basic question. Finally, although Cara is tough and certainly can hold her own, I just found it hard to believe that she wouldn’t have someone with her during the party when she wandered off to the bathroom… it was such a naive thing to do and it sort of made me question her common sense/ “street smarts”. All in all, it was an entertaining read and I hope that more books will follow as I am keen to see what happens next with her sister and also with Thor who was a delightful side character.
