look at me, saying i would dnf more books this year and then still finishing this one. where's the clown emoji when you need it. oh, here it is: 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡opening a patreon so that you can help pay for the therapy i so obviously need.speaking of, you know who else needs therapy????? the characters in this goddamn awful book!!!will this containspoilers? why hell yes, of course it will, why would you even ask, silly you!!!are you ready? no you're not. will i yell? i haven't decided yet.OF COURSE I WILL FUCKING YELL, YOU CAN'T EXPECT ME TO READ THIS, THIS..... BOOK (???) AND NOT YELL ABOUT IT.:) i'm alright, thanks for asking.let's use the clown emoji for my notes.you can't expect me to write actual real and long and meaningful sentences, no, you will just get a summary of my kindle notes. are most of them "are you kidding me", "go to therapy", "i hate it here", "cry me a river", "YOU LITTLE FUCKWIT"?i don't know :) i will find out with all of you :)🤡 hihi, look at him (i am also worried about myself, it's alright)🤡 i knew i should have dnf'ed this pretty early on cause on page 9 our lovely female character C... whatever her name is, says"I could recite Shakespeare all day, where Mandy likes to quote the gossip headlines off Twitter."oh aren't you a special little girl :) i'm so proud, do you want a headpat? do you? no? what do you want then you special little snowflake? you've never been on Twitter? you only read Shakespeare all day? are you better than everyone else? huh? who are you trying to impress here? go touch grass🤡 because i am a dumbass though, i did not dnf after this🤡 that's a lie, because i did🤡 but i PICKED IT UP AGAIN.🤡 oh btw, massive r*pe trigger warning for this one🤡 should i tell you guys about the plot? you can all read synopses right. though, i am sometimes not sure if people on this site can actually read, so better safe than sorry:meet Cora and Dean! they both suck but that's not important right now! Cora is insufferable and Dean is allegedly a bad boy even though i have yet to see him do some cool bad boy things and i have already finished the book so i don't have high hopes for that happening anytime soon. Dean has been dating Cora's sister (Twitter feed Mandy, we've mentioned her before but OH BOY ARE WE GOING TO COME BACK TO THAT DUMB PIECE OF WET GARBAGE) for a whooping fifteen years!!!! wuhu!! yet Cora still thinks that he probably cheated on her multiple times because he's such a bad boy, give him a spanking! (why do you guys let me write reviews) plot twist, mandy actually cheated on him but that's like the least important thing about anything right now, i don't even know why i mentioned it.anyway, Dean and Cora get kidnapped!!! by a guy called Earl, later dubbed "The Matchmaker". Earl kidnaps couples he is sure are not in love yet and then through the magic ofStockholm Syndrome✨ makes them fall in love with each other. Earl obviously r*pes Cora and also makes Dean r*pe Cora and that was actually the part where i was like "huh, should not have read this in the gym"🤡 i don't actually have many notes (or any) on the time they are in captivity. it is what it is🤡 actually no, i lied again. during their last forced intimate encounter Dean and Cora get weirdly into it! before it was all just: closed eyes and "i'm sorry, i'm so sorry", you know, the things you would expect when you are forced to r*pe your sister-in-law at gun point but that last time Dean just starts stroking her clit and Cora is like "this is fantastic sex" and i am like EARL IS LITERALLY RIGHT BESIDE YOU WATCHING WITH A GODDAMN GUN, THIS IS NEITHER THE TIME NOR THE PLACE and then Dean has the AUDACITY to look at her in"Shock. Disbelief"when she is about to come. WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN SHOCK AND DISBELIEF. Dean is all like "hihi, haha, gonna give Cora an orgasm while i'm r*ping her :)" and then he's all surprised pikachu face when she actually gets one??????????????i would also like a sweet release - the sweet release of death, i beg you🤡 obviously Cora gets pregnant after 3 weeks of constant r*pe. thankfully it's not a major plot point cause she aborts it off page. but then Dean is like"Do you know if it was...mine"HOW THE FUCK WOULD SHE KNOW THAT YOU DIPSHIT.....i need to calm myself, deep breaths Jonathan, deep breaths🤡 Let's talk about my favourite character: Mandy :)now, where is the gun emoji when you need it.when Cora and Dean escape and have been home for SIX (6) (SIX!!!) (6!!!!!!!!) (i really need to make it completely clear to you that it's six) WEEKS - not months, not years, WEEKS. SIX MEASLY WEEKS. they have been in captivity for THREE WEEKS. and now they are back for SIX WEEKS. okay? okay? are you guys with me? Mandy not only complains that"Oh Dean, baby, we haven't been intimate for 6 weeks."(??????????) she also tries to set her sister up with another man.now, she doesn't know by that point in the story that Dean also r*ped her sister, but she knows her sister was r*ped, which brings me to my point:THOSE TWO ARE FUCKING TRAUMATIZED YOU GODDAMN UGGGHHHHHH. even without knowing that Dean was forced to commit a heinous crime (not to forget that she KNOWS that he killed Earl), DON'T YOU THINK THAT SIX WEEKS ARE NOT ENOUGH TIME TO HEAL FROM A GODDAMN KIDNAPPING WHERE YOU THOUGHT YOU WOULD DIE.DO YOU REALLY THINK YOUR SISTER SHOULD GET WITH A NEW MAN RIGHT NOW????? YOU REALLY THINK SHE'S READY FOR THAT???DO YOU HAVE A SINGLE BRAINCELL MANDY?EVER HEARD OFEMPATHY🤡 if you think i am done yelling now, you would be mistaken. i am just getting started🤡 this book is a dual pov, which means we have an entire part that is just Cora, than an entire part that is just Dean and then Cora again.🤡Dean spends his entire POV being like "I know you are drowning Cora, but I can save you" to which Cora is like "Nope, you are bad for me" to which he is like "blablablablablablablabla" - you get it🤡 and then when it's Cora's POV again he is like "This relationship is toxic, we can't do this" WHAT DO YOU MEAN. WHERE WAS THE ENERGY FIVE SECONDS AGO MY BOY🤡 you're probably all wondering: "what the fuck is your problem, Jonathan". oh several actually, i have this presentation next week and i am really not ready but also🤡 THIS BOOK PRETENDS LIKE IT'S SO FUCKINGROMANTICHOW THOSE TWO FALL IN LOVE. it's all like "Oh look at them, they have overcome so much, how romantic."🤡 NO.🤡 THEY NEED THERAPY🤡 Dean says about his relationship with Mandy"Maybe… maybe, but it’s always been a shallow kind of love. Comfortable. Surface deep. We have no scars, no battle wounds. We haven’t been to Hell and back, or clung to each other in the shadows, crying, shaking, expelling the dirtiest pieces of our soul together."is that REALLY what love needs to be like or is it just TRAUMA. i'll give you a hint.you know why you feel attracted to Cora? Because she fucking reminds you of your trauma. GO TO THERAPY🤡 the middle part was also really boring🤡 also, when Dean first sees Cora, he's like "I will marry her someday" and then he goes for her sister and dates her for 15 years. maybe he deserves that clown emoji more than i do🤡 when Dean and Mandy break up she is immediately like "I wasted fifteen years with you"i love when couples immediately turn when they break up, like two seconds ago she was all like don't break up with me i love you and now she's all like fifteen years wasted, what do you mean wasted? you had a good run and now it's over. don't pretend like nothing mattered from the past because you're sad in the present🤡 Cora fucking adopts her kidnappers dogs. I asked for opinions on that and both people thought it was okay, so maybe i am the weird one here🤡“I hate you. I always have.” “No.” I cradle her wet cheeks between my palms and plant a kiss on her mouth, tender and soft. “You love me. You fucking love me, Cora.”nope, trauma response🤡"But I know it’s love… it has to be, because if this isn’t love… Then I’m certain it does not exist."well, it's fake then cause this is a trauma response, baby, get therapy <3🤡 :) when they have consensual sex for the first time Dean says this:"Did you miss my cock."🤡 ahem🤡 WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU ASK THAT WHEN THE LAST TIME YOU'VE BEEN INSIDE HER WAS WHEN YOU WERE FORCED TO R*PE HER. YOU ARE NOT SOME CUTE COUPLE WHO DIDN'T HAVE SEX FOR A WHILE AND NOW YOU'RE BACK TOGETHER AND CAN'T WAIT TO GET IT ON.and Cora is all like "moans" and "yes". just shoot me :) please shoot me :) i crave death :) give it to me :)🤡 this book is so dramatic and fake deep. i get that you all are traumatized but"Slow, gentle lovemaking that wiped us clean of all that violence. Of all that darkness. But this is anything but soft. This is rough and raw and dirty, and we’re animals clawing at each other, biting, all primal growls and desperate thrusts. It’s fitting, I decide. After all, we were created in darkness. It’s in our blood."shut up :)🤡"But then I feel her start to tremble, shivering in my arms as she tries to hide her tears from me. I hold her tight, kissing her shoulder and whispering soothing words into her ear. I told her I would stay with her until the darkness passed, and I did not lie."what a healthy after sex response. you two are so good at convincing me that you are indeed soulmates and not just two people who need a shit ton of therapy to get out of this unhealthy relationship you found yourself in because of, say it with me kids,trauma✨🤡"And i can't stop caring about you, just because our circumstances are not ideal."not IDEAL???? DO YOU HEAR YOURSELF??🤡 wrap it up please Jonathan, i am getting tired of this🤡"Maybe this was simply born out of trauma and survival."MAYBE????🤡 oh btw there is another survivor in this who also got pregnant but kept the baby and she's like "it's Matthews (the dude she's been in captivity with), not Earls" and i'm like "how do you know :)" i doubt you got a real paternity test :) considering Matthew is kind of dead :) and i think you would need some form of his DNA to find that out :) but okay, babe, you do you :) only crazy people here :) help me :)🤡 one time someone is like"Something so horrible, yet so tragically beautiful."give me a fucking break. stop looking for hidden poetry in your trauma. go to therapy.🤡"Maybe love is singing her favorite song in the dark, just so she can sleep. Maybe love is giving away the shoes on your feet to help keep her warm. Maybe love is coming over in the middle of the night when the power goes out because you know she’s afraid of the dark. And maybe love is walking away because it’s the only way she’ll find the light again."maybe love is going to therapy instead of making me sit through this pseudo poetic bullshit🤡 i'll stop now. was there a point i was trying to make in my review? i can't remember... oh... yes🤡 Stop trying to sell me a toxic, completely trauma made and based relationship as something romantic and desirable. 0.5 stars. Everyone go to therapy.
