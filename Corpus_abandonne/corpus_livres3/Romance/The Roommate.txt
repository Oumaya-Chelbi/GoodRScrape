2020 Ripped Bodice Summer Bingo: ‪Apple OrchardContent Notes:on-page car accident (no casualties or major injuries); anxiety/panic over driving; discussion of leaked nude photos in the past (secondary character)The faded wallpaper exuded kitschy charm, fighting for her affection, but she couldn’t shake the crushing weight of her disappointment. Clara wiped off the seat of the sofa before sitting down.“So this is how it feels to be well and truly fucked.”“I get that a lot,” said a low voice behind her.Super charming and sex-positive re: sex work. I wrote down a bunch of complaints as I was reading, but honestly the couple’s chemistry is so adorable that I hand-waved nitpicks that normally would’ve bugged me. The Clara heiress conflict got a bit old/contradictory/confusing at times. If she has a trust fund, then why did she need to room with Josh once her friend bailed on her? I don’t know. I rolled with it. Also super weird that her family is in the background and never makes an appearance like one would predict. Clara keeps worrying about how they’d react to her new venture. Literally who cares, and the book agrees with me because we never find out! Several aspects around that socialite characterization/storyline struck me as odd or just bored me.The whole project depended on his ability to craft the next Kama Sutra, and he couldn’t shake the nerves threatening to eat his intestines.There’s this throwaway line about the Kama Sutra that pissed me off. I am projecting here because it is truly minor, but god do I hate any mention of the Kama Sutra in western contexts. So it clearly wasn’t that minor to me because I’m still seething enough to point it out here. This is my complaint for posterity. Moving on.As usual in recent contemporary rom-coms, the third act breakup happens wayyy too late and is resolved wayyy too late. This is not news if you know me, but I take all opportunities to air my grievances re: this topic. Not going to write a longform review to gush over everything I liked (I liked a lot! It wouldn’t be a very interesting review because I’d summarize most of the book), but two major takeaways are 1) Josh is a golden retriever in human form and 2) It’s a real cute romance with pining, hot sex, and roommate/friends-to-lovers vibes. I’m not a socialite, but I seriously related to Clara with her prudish tendencies, love of lamination, fear of driving, and using higher education as a way to “extend the exit ramp to adulthood” (oof, that line struck a chord). Nitpicks aside, I recommend THE ROOMMATE. Definitely check out an excerpt to see if you click with the writing.Also: this is the first book I’ve read that has perfectly captured my terror/anxiety/panic over driving. Whew. Clara’s POV is way too close to comfort. I’m impressed that she mostly gets over her fear during the book (I assuredly have not). I have to give props because the book nails that terror; reading those scenes was like reflecting a mirror over my amygdala. I got my license after failing the test twice when I was eighteen, and then promptly never drove again. And unlike Clara, I will never move to Los Angeles, thus living out a blissful carless existence in urban environments with good (well, livable) public transit. 😂 Not even a cinnamon roll of a porn star could make me want to drive. Sorry, Josh. You’re cute but not that cute.Disclaimer: I received a free e-ARC from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.
