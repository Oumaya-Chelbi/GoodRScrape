“I wish we never had to leave the fountain. We never did.”You know a book is a masterpiece when it made you fall in love with the character you hated for most of the series.I can't express in words how much I love this book and Damon and Winter. To be honest, I was so ready to hate him in his book but I only had the sliver of hope that maybe just maybe he's not the guy he really appeared to be and he literally proved me wrong.The best redemption arc because I'm the same girl who hated him with passion when I started reading this series and now I'm a Damon Torrance defender for all my life.This book was a perfection and so messed up and I know I need therapy for loving this book and Damon but at this point I don't care. This is definitely my favourite book in this series and I couldn't help but feel the aderanaline rush while reading some scenes. It was so addictive that I wanted to inhale the words from the pages. Because how the hell I'm just sitting and reading a scene where Damon took Winter for a motorbike ride because he wanted her to see Black and the next minute I wanted to ride that bike with Damon. There wasn't one moment, one chapter, one sentence that I wasn't sucked into.“You…” He trailed off, searching for words. “It was pure, and it was a dream. I didn’t want to change you. I just wanted to be a part of it all. Of everything beautiful you were going to do.”This was the most emotional, beautiful and the heartbreaking book in this series. The horrible things both Winter and Damon went through broke my heart. The chemistry between them was everything and I felt an instant connection to them. The closet scene, the bike riding scene, when he took her for a drive in his car, everytime he whispered words and secrets in her ear, the fountain scene, the maze scene, hospital scene,the fountain dance scene when he was wishing while looking at her face💘💓💕💘💖💘💗 (I cried reading that scene), everytime he watched her and she didn't knew he watched her, every scene in which Winter danced for Damon not knowing where he was and what he might do to her, the anticipation and excitement of not knowing what's going to happen to Winter had me hooked up.Damon and Will's friendship is also one of the major highlights of this bookand IDID NOTexpected them have um....more than just afriendshipkind of friendship?? Not that I'm complaining because DamonWill duo is so much better than MichaelKai duo.I have a hate-love relationship with this series but I always end up devouring each book because apparently this author puts straight up cocaine in this series.This was also in a dual timeline and I absolutely enjoyed both the timelines because Damon and Winter slayed. I am addicted to this series even though I hate most of the characters. This is a hit or a miss kind of series and I get why but I absolutely enjoyed the vibes, the addictive plotline, drama, romance, spicy smut because PD really writes the best spicy scenes 🤌🏻❤️‍🔥, her eerie and impressive writing and I like how it gets better with each book, characters even though they are really messed up in the head, and just everything.“My woman doesn’t ask permission. She’s a force. Say it louder.”Her chin started to tremble, but her voice burst out strong. “My place is at your side.” And I kissed her, making sure she fucking believed it. She was always wanted.Live laugh love fuck Damon Torrance➸ Winter AshbyI always had a problem with the fmc written by Penelope but Winter took hold of my heart from the very first moment. Winter always was her own person and made no excuses to do what she needed to do and to get what she wanted. Winter wanted to be treated like a normal girl and I loved that no matter what and what life throws at her she always stands up for herself. She was no nonsense person and never craved any attention from anyone except her ghost boy Damon. I hated the way everyone treated her, belittle her like she was a little fragile girl who lost her eyesight because of her own stupidity. But she's so much more than that and only Damon made her feel all the emotions she thought she would never feel. She wanted to follow her dreams if being a ballerina and he let her do that without telling her that she can't have that or that she shouldn't. The way she understood Damon and gave him the love and care he needed but also brought him to his knees whenever he did something wrong 🤭 Everyone thought Winter is just a sweet docile little girl and I loved to see the way Damon brought out the wild and adventurous side of her.“Being with him was like dancing. Dancing with death.”➸ Damon TorranceI want to give this man the biggest and the longest hug in the world. I know he'll probably kill me for it but who cares. His story broke my heart and I don't how but he shouldn't be living in a world where eleven year olds thinks of how to end their lives. Why I think Damon is the best man in this series? Because he never made any excuses for his actions and didn't blamed his life situations for it. He had a rough childhood and adulthood and never had any normal parental love and care but that never stopped this man from creating his own family. He knew he was toxic and psychotic and he owned every shit about himself and even worked on those issues on his own. He also had this soft, caring and possessive side underneath his wild and dangerous demeanour. Which surprised me because one minute he was tormenting Winter with his dangerous whispering voice and the next moment he was holding her in his arms in a closet and keeping her ears closed to keep her safe. It took him so long to come out of his nightmares and talk about them with someone and I was a mess of tears and sobbing the moment he confessed all his nightmares and secrets to Winter 😭❤️‍🩹“Every moment with her, I was real. I would’ve been faithful, and I would’ve died protecting her.”╰┈➤ Winter and DamonThey were always meant for each other even if they destroyed each other in the process of loving each other.Winter is who she is because of Damon and she hates him for it but she always knew that there is a part of her that would never forget that eleven year old boy in the fountain. He was so alone for all his life until Winter came and found him in the fountain. When Damon met her again as her ghost boy, took her on adventures, gave her all the time and care she needed, didn't coddle her like a kid who can't see or do anything, she fell for him again. He got a tattoo for her name origin "Winter" 🥺, wrote her a note with a braille typewriter, built her a fountain which he designed himself and kept the hair barratte she gave him when they were kids hidden somewhere because it was so precious to him. He is the same man who wanted to get revenge on her. And I get it why she must've felt violated and used after knowing his true identity but oh god that scene hurts so good. The way he was begging her to not let him go and I wish Winter gave him a chance to explain himself 😭“You dance?” she said in my ear.“No.”“You are right now,” she pointed out. And I stopped, realizing we’d been turning in a slow circle.When he doesn't like dancing but for her would do everything🤌🏻💘😭I loved that they both were their true selves with each other. He didn't ignored her or acted nervous around her and she always taunted him with her actions and words and called him out on his shit. He treated her like the woman she was, respected her choices and decisions. They are perfect for each other. Also there was an emotional aspect to their realtionship more than just the physical and mental attraction which I loved a lot because the previous couples lacked that in their relationship.“I hate my house. It’s so dark there.” He paused, then continued. “It all fucking disappeared when you were dancing, though. It made the world prettier. I liked it.”I was happy for them because somehow they both always found their way back to each other. When they kids, when they were teenagers, when they adults. It didn't matter if it was for some revenge, obsession or curiosity, Damon and Winter were made for each other. Their lives were entwined by their twisted fate from the very first moment they met.“She and I… we’re alone in the universe. No one was us.”The ending was perfect.The best if I must say because the drama and the action in the ending chapters was chef's kiss. I never saw that plot twist coming because how in the hell Damon is blood related to people in his own friends group. Glad his father is dead instead of making new siblings for Damon. I'm not lying when I say I absolutely devoured the last five chapters and I'm not even mad about reading another threesome in this series because chapter 30 was just so hot. Possessive Damon is just something else. I need another book about Winterdamon because these 600+ pages weren't enough.“How much does this fun cost?” “Sticking with me for the rest of your life,” I replied, putting my arm around her waist. “That’ll suck.”—————————————————————————I know i need therapy for loving this book and DAMON FUCKING TORRANCE but who cares because red was always my favourite colour 🫢RTC!—————————————————————————I'm suing you all if i dont end up falling in love with psychotic damon torrance
