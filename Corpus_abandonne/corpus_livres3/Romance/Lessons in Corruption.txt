This one started as a 5-star book and after the first half, it gradually dropped down to a 2-star book for me. Such a pity, indeed!I can say it is 3,5 stars for me in the end but because it definitely didn't feel like 4, 3 stars it is!*********************************************This is the love story of a 26-year old teacher with her 18-year old student.Cressida is married but she is not happy. Her husband is too conservative and twice her age. She sees our hero in a supermarket car park and lusts for him, then goes home, tries to get intimate with her husband one more time and when she feels humiliated and ignored again, she decides that enough is enough and wants a divorce. The asshole husband refuses to sign the divorce papers for a long while but she leaves home and they start to live separately.If you need to know, her relationship with our hero begins when she is technically married.*********************************************Our hero, King, is so very sweet. He is hot, sweet and loyal. I normally dislike MC books and bikers but King is something else, he is so dreamy. As Cressida says, he is a blond angel.Our heroine Cressida is kinda annoying. She wants a lustful life. She is horny all the time. She wants to live a romantic and hot relationship but she is also scared of everything. She lacks self-confidence, too.And because of Cressida, there is a frustrating vicious cycle in the book:Cressida wants King but she believes she shouldn't be with him because1. He is 8 years younger than her2. He is her student3. He is in the biker world, which is dangerous.4. He is young and she thinks he will get bored with her soonAnd because she both wants him and thinks she shouldn't, there is a constant pull and push in the book. When he kisses her, she gives in, then she remembers it is a mistake and pushes him away. When he writes her poems, she gives in, then she remembers she shouldn't and pushes him away. When he gives her an oral, she loses her mind with pleasure but then again she thinks it is wrong and pushes him away. This happens so many times that I really got annoyed with her. King, on the other hand, never gives up pursuing her. Such a darling...He wanted me to know him. How could any woman resist a man who opened his beautiful heart to her without knowing what she would do with it?*********************************************King is awesome but when you think about it, it feels impossible that an 18-year-old guy would speak like him... What he says and how he says it is always wonderful but I would believe it if he were 28 or 30. At the age of 18, could any guy feel and speak like this? I am not sure... sounds very unlikely.But still when you read what he says, you want to believe he could be 18 and say all these things... Wishful thinking it is :)))“Never met a woman like you. Know I won’t again. You find somethin’ worth keepin’, you find a way to fuckin’ keep it. Not to say to that is this: whatever pain and ugliness I bring you by bein’ with you, I promise I’ll bring you double that in sweetness and beauty. You hear me on that, because I may be a man without a normal moral compass, but I’m a man who makes a woman a promise, and I’ll die before I break it.”He sometimes speaks like Max in KA's Gamble :)))*********************************************OK, back to the book... As I said at the beginning, the book was awesome with sweet King's wooing and all but then lots and lots of other stuff bored me, as in KA's books. Drama about two guys at school, drama caused by her mum and ex, the rivalry and fights in the MC world, the kidnapping, the tortures, the hospitalization, blah bla... While running from one drama to another, I lost interest in the book. The book was totally boring for me in the second part.*********************************************And of course, there was lots of sex but most of them were not to my liking and none of them made me feel because after all that wooing, poems and lusting, I expected more emotional and passionate scenes but they were either ordinary or a bit dirty and short. Even the kissing scenes didn't make me feel much. Cressida was saying it was an epic kiss but once again "saying but not showing" resulted in me not feeling it.I think the more I read this kind of books, the more I appreciate the books such as Veiled Innocence and Black Swan Affair, where the sex scenes are really epic. Of course there are many other books but these two have a special place in my heart.*********************************************All in all, if you like KA books and MC books and if you like forbidden romance with a younger hero, you may enjoy this book but for me it fell short.*********************************************Writing:It is written only from Cressida's point of view.323 pages.Too many editing mistakes.Didn't make me feel much.The book has a HFN ending. They will appear in other characters' books and then Book 4 After the Fall is again their story, where I assume they will have their HEA.After all this disappointment, I don't think I will continue the series.*********************************************You can followmy Instagram page from here
