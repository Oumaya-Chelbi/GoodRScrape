**4.2/5 stars**I really enjoyed this book. It had the setup for the overuse of tropes and actually didn't go that route. Something that I appreciate a lot when I read a romance story is when the authors make the female side characters non-toxic. Too often, they use the easy trope that women are conniving and mean, and I'm alwayshappilysurprised when I see more female friendships that don't involve snatching weaves, clawing eyeballs and backstabbing for a guy.“He catches my eye and butterflies swarm in my stomach. Wait, no, I’m pretty sure that’s just hunger pains.”-ScarlettIf this is not a mood lmaoI addedLeoas a book-boyfriend because he was flawless...or well, flawless even in his imperfections. He was sodevotedandbesottedwithScarlett. The first minute he saw her, he knew he wanted her and he pursued her hard, determined to make her his. It was mentioned that in his early years of being a professional hockey player, he let the fame get to his head, and would have a lot of partying and hookups but that after learning his lesson because of some scandals, he's been pretty much celibate and focusing on hockey; rarely ever hooking up. So when he meetsScarletthe wasn't seeing anyone for a while, and never was serious with any of them. He was soromanticwithScarlett, soniceandobservant...and very much trying to woo her the whole time. It was delectable to read.“I know it makes me an ass, but I’m really glad your date was a disaster.”-LeoAs forScarlett, because of her recent breakup that left her on the fence with men (athletes in particular), she pushesLeoaway, his attempts at wooing her slowly getting to her. Her pushing didn't really bother me. I thought it was nice to have a heroine not falling at the hero's feet right away. She stood her ground, and he respected her but was still trying. It was beautiful to see him so devoted to her, so interested. There was no doubt ofLeo's feelings for her, and I don't blame her for slowly falling for him, letting him in. It all made sense. She was a fairly strong girl, a bit clumsy in the beginning, a bit naive near the end, which caused some slight drama but I didn't mind it much.“She’s either going to be pleasantly surprised or run out the door. Here’s hoping she’s wearing heels, so I can catch her if she chooses the second option.”-LeoThere wasn't many sex scenes in this book. The steam wasn't super high, not many details but it didn't bother me at all. I thinkScarlettandLeo's chemistry was still very much there. The way their relationship developed was very sweet and natural.“Everything else is bullshit. I just want to talk to my girl.”-Leo✔️HFN/HEA?In the epilogue, H proposes to h.+Bonus✔️Dual POV✔️Standalone✔️Safe✔️No cheatingh's ex kind of forces a kiss on her (brushing lips), H and h are official when it happens✔️No OW/ Slight OMh's ex comes back asking for a second chance. h also goes on a date with a random guy her bestfriend suggested to her, she goes just to please her, H gets jealous even tho they aren't a couple at that point.✔️Slow burnH and h have sex early on, as a ONS but then it takes a while before they get together and have sex again, centered more on H wooing h✔️Push and pullH pulling and h pushing✔️Short separation/dramaNear the end, h decides to take a break with H because the Press is being too much.
