OOOF, I really enjoyed Praise and was so looking forward to this book😩 usually when I read a 2.5⭐️ book i round up, but this one had me so vexed I just can’t this timemy issues are threefold:1) for a book about a sex worker, the language around sex work in this book is NOT positive in the least2) Queerness is not a fetish to titillate straight people. If you’re writing about queer people, don’t exclusively use them as a tool to turn on the straight MCs3) the hero is a shitty partner until about 92% of the book, and his “big grovel” to make up for his punk ass behavior is *checks notes* public sex with anal play👀 like?!??? HOWWW is that making up for hundreds of pages of shitstain behavior??I read book one in this series on the flight to WA and while I had some small quibbles with how queerness was portrayed, overall I really enjoyed it & rec’d it to several people. I was so looking forward to reading book two on my flight back home!!! And it sounded like a lot of things that really work for me— age gap, taboo relationship, voyeur/exhibitionist kink, D/s, and the heroine is a cam girl!! Like so much potentialAnd honestly, Garret didn’t work for me from the beginning— he starts the book with this complaint about 1NS not wanting to get hella kinky with him, and like 1) why are you framing this as “oh poor me, my sexual partners keep telling me no when I want them to do sex acts, I’ve been done so dirty” like people do not ~owe~ you their consent?!? Just bc you want to do something doesn’t mean your partner has to say yes!!! And also 2) kink requires trust, so like not surprising people aren’t down for public sex right out of the gate. Earn it!!!And honestly, that’s my issue with Garret— he lies to Mia the whole book, he isn’t honest about his feelings, he expects commitment and exclusivity (which is whack when he knows she’s a cam girl, like literally it’s her job!!!) when he refuses to give her either. He’s afraid of commitment and refuses to give Mia any sort of meaningful attachment, claiming they’re “just playing” and all the while he’s pulling a You’ve Got Mail style “I’m messaging you as a secret person while also being someone you know IRL” ruse, except here he fucks her multiple times before she find out the truth, and NOT from him🙄 he does literally ~nothing~ to earn her affection or her trust, and when he fucks up instead of some meaningful grovel, maybe going to therapy and processing his shit and proving to her that he’s ready to commit to her & choose a relationship with her, he……lets her chain him up and massage his prostate? Ah yes, irrefutable proof of reformation and personal growth!!!And that’s without touching on how EOM portrays sex workers or queer people🤦🏼‍♀️ tbh I felt iffy about queer rep in Praise (feel free to check out my review) but while book one just gave me weird vibes, this book made me mad. It repeats Praise’s issue of “ooh look your boyfriend is being distant, just use a queer woman to make him jealous!!! wlw is sexy & so good at turning men on🥴” like???? I was uncomfy with it in book one, but at least there Charlie talks about being attracted to her and there’s *some* allusion to her maybe exploring her sexuality? But to use that again & w/out any discussion of queerness really bothered me. The only other queer character of note in this book is Drake, Garret’s best friend who’s known as a “manwhore” and “player” later surprises Garret by being bi/pan👀 so y’know just playing into every stereotype about bi people. And then later there’s this interchange between Mia and Garret:“Well, we’ve only been open for three months, but we did have a party of five rent the biggest voyeur room a couple weeks ago.”“Five?”“Yep. You want to hear the crazy part?”My eyes widen. “Yes,” I reply eagerly.“There was only one woman.”My jaw hangs down again. “Oh my God! Did you watch them?”He scratches the back of his neck like he’s a little embarrassed. “It was probably the best thing I’ve ever seen.”I laugh even louder, slapping him on the arm. “You perv!”“What? It’s literally my job! And why am I a perv if they clearly wanted an audience?”“I can’t believe you watched four guys rail one chick. That’s crazy!”First off, he owns a sex club so I hope you already knew he was a perv??? And also the existence of queer men isn’t “crazy”🙄 added to the fact that earlier when he finds out Drake is also attracted to men his response is a wide eyed, shocked thought “well you learn something new every day” just rubbed me the wrong way. If you’re running a sex club that is queer inclusive (which is explicitly stated multiple times in book one!!) this whole behavior around queerness feels, at best, straight centric and somewhat….fetishizing is a little strong….but like a little accurate?and then of course, there’s the treatment of sex workers. Mia is a cam girl, and while she likes & is empowered by her work (and Garret seems to like it too👀) the way people talk about it is pretty condescending. He says things like “are you excited to flash your tits to creeps on the internet” or “When you come into my club dressed like a prostitute, you better believe I’m going to control you. Your tits are hanging out, Mia.” After watching her masturbate in a voyeur room @ the club he says, “here she is. Somehow making something normally perceived as awkward and vulgar look like a fucking art form. This isn’t a grotesque display of her pussy or something meant to make us feel dirty for watching.” Like a weird fucking thing to say considering your work & her work!!! And like when a friend refers to her as a sex worker (bc she is one!!) he says:“please don’t say that…. I know there’s no shame, but I mean…how would you feel if it was [your girlfriend]? Flashing her puss—"“Watch it,” he barks.“My point exactly.” He rolls his eyes before nodding. “Well, there’s a difference. You just said things between you and Mia are casual. Unless it’s not…”Like, these are not things someone says about a partner whose work and autonomy they respect👀 especially if he owns a fucking sex club!!! Even some of the things Mia says about sex/sex work run the gamut from bizarre to distasteful— she makes several comments about watching people have sex being weird and uncomfortable, but that’s ~literally~ what she gets paid to do🤦🏼‍♀️ and when discussing another cam girl, she describes her as “plastic,” not genuine, and an unskilled performer who relies on her body. Idk that just felt like a wildly cruel & judgy thing to say about a sex worker?? And of course, at a certain point Garret decides that while he won’t commit to her, she isn’t allowed to do sex work or even be sexual with anyone but him🙄 but fear not!!! By the end he magically changes his mind and is cool with it despite like 6 scenes where he has a visceral and loud negative reaction to her being remotely sexy with another person!!Anyways I’m kind of rambling now & it’s two am so I really should go to bed, but this was just such a let down. There’s also a smattering of pretty negative commentary about women (“they’re catty bitches, most women are mean to each other and that’s why Mia doesn’t have women friends”) a weird comment about “skinny shaming” and after what felt like (to me, I could be wrong) a shallow dive into Garret’s depression, the reader is informed that Garret is ready to have a baby w/ Mia bc he’s been on antidepressants x therapy for a year, and also spent that year proving “that he had everything under control” which feels like not a great metric to measure mental health?? Like require control and perfection all the time feels…not great?There’s also just like a shitty power imbalance the whole book, and literally at no point is it balanced— I don’t have the energy to dive into that rn but it was deeply disappointing to meMaybe I’m being too harsh on this book??? Idk, I just so enjoyed book one and was like a liiiiiiittle worried about the queer rep, but overall loved it & was excited to find a new erotic author who I liked, and then this had so many issues I was just ridiculously bummed🤷🏼‍♀️ please Please PLEASE if y’all are gonna write about sex work and queerness, please run this shit by sensitivity readers bc this book actively aggrieved me
