Falling for your best friend, who just happens to be an up and coming country star, is probably not the best idea.Not even being a blip on his romantic radar? Yeah, shoot me now.Growing up in Alex McCloud’s shadow was far from easy. Then, he blew out of town, before the ink was even dry on his recording contract, with empty promises of keeping in touch that he has never once kept. Some best friend, right?Now, he sings his heart out to millions of fans, and I milk cows on my family’s struggling dairy farm. Well, that is until Alex strolls back into town, and he’s got more than writing his new album on his mind.I know from experience that I need to guard my heart, or I may end up being just another girl in a country song. It’s just harder than I thought, trying to get my brain and my heart on the same page.
