PSAüì£: Tissues, wine, and a solid wall to chuck your kindle to being mandatory accompaniments while reading!Firstly, the writing is good and her buildup of angst and gutwrenches is spot on.******************Spoiler-ish review*********************"–õ—é–±–æ–≤—å –Ω–µ —Ç–æ, —á—Ç–æ –≤—ã –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç–µ –ø–æ–Ω—è—Ç—å, —ç—Ç–æ —Ç–æ, —á—Ç–æ –≤—ã —á—É–≤—Å—Ç–≤—É–µ—Ç–µ –≤ —Å–≤–æ–µ–º —Å–µ—Ä–¥—Ü–µ. –ù–µ—Ç —Å–ª–æ–≤, —ç—Ç–æ –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–æ —Ç–∞–∫."Lyubov' ne to, chto vy mozhete ponyat...""Love is not what you can understand, it's what you feel in your heart.""No words, it's just that"A painful story of hurtful love where the young innocent girl falls for a damaging man again and again and all he can say is"Pozhalyusta prosti, menya,"Please forgive me, I'm sorryWhile the sentiment is beautiful, the story is infuriatingly frustrating. it's pitiful to see a young life being destroyed by debilitating & forbidden love. I had a strong urge to somehow pierce the Love Bubble Adrianna was trapped in, but she wasn't listening to her well wishers and her Executioner himself, there's a fat chance she'd listen to a readerüòèI am not a Kova fan so let the brickbats from #KovaLovers begin !Having said that,he suits the story perfectly because he's a quintessential asshole alpha who hides behind professional facade yet messes up with naive Adrianna's heart, every chance he gets. The young girl is an aspiring Olympic Gymnast. Her body takes battering of the worst kind when training and her heart suffers innumerable blows in this book.Kova doesn't help the matter , in fact one of the blows, or should I say the hardest blow, was delivered by him.His job was to catch me if I fell. Not sweep the rug out from under my feet and watch me hit the ground.but guess what? he's¬† still mishandling her and throwing off her Balance with his Bipolar moodsBook 1 had me fuming at Adrianna's¬† Naiv√©t√® & stupidity and Kova's¬† insensitivity.Glad to know nothing has changed in book 2! They're still wearing those crowns firmly.It's a song I've hear before" I can't stand you""I'm enamoured by you""I hate you""I love you"On. Repeat !Here's the thing, I actually felt sorry for Adrianna, cause she's just an impressionable 18 year old, all starry eyed at her handsome as devil coach, who's the essential role model for her. They speak the same language, they understand gymnastics, they're both driven by ambition and they understand dedication and discipline required to get into Olympics better than regular folks, so it's like finding your soulmate, only he's forbidden !!This is why we clicked so well. He more than anyone understood my drive and determination . The need to succeed in the sport , not just because I wanted to be on top, but because I hungered for it, craved it.The girl doesn't know any better and the man is driven by lust, at least that's what came across!Kova was my strength, but I was his weakness.A weakness he worked on to improve and make resilient.A strength that I drew from.They're comrade-in-arms on opposite sides of the field !Ahhh, I wanted to strangle Kova for destroying the poor girl, before she even started in life.The secondary characters are simply awesome !!I was loving Hayden and Avery so much. They're the soundest pair of besties anybody could have or should have in their lives and they CONSTANTLY¬† had Ria's¬† back, gave her advice, hell¬† warned her all the time, but I guess Aid's¬† brain was in a lusty haze emitted by Kova...tsk...tsk!"What is wrong with you? It's like you have Lucifer on both of your shoulders cheering you on. The louder he gets, the dumber you get.""Ria, it doesn't just happen." She scolded me as if I were a small child. "We've gone over this, you can't just fall onto a dick."Or Hayden"Are you fucking kidding me?"!!"Damn straight you weren't thinking."!!"Un-fucking-real."!!"I'm going to fucking kill him,""Do not have sex with him again. Please,"After Keira from thoughtless series, Adrianna is the next heroine who's really stubbornly frustrating for me. She's just so in love , she starts to blame HERSELF for his Faults!!!Un-fucking-believable!!I was disgusting. I was literally the reason why he acted the way he did.I really pitied her at this point, a girl who lost everything, how is she still standing !So in conclusion, I may have not liked Kova much, I urge you all to go read this book, it's eagerly awaited sequel to Balance, its a dream for Kova Lovers or #TeamKova .Two scenes had me like WTF !The scene in his office and the ice therapy scene after her rigorous training. *SSMH*I need to mention something, with this being a hefty book, the story didn't progress much from Balance, they're still stuck in a quagmire of indecision and Lustful desperation. Except for bombshells that destroy Aidrianna in the last 20%, the initial 80% is a detailed account of Gymnastics and meets. Maybe it's a deliberate attempt to heighten the angst and showcase the hopeless love, if it was; it worked.The angst factor of the story is a gauge breaker. infinite heart breaks and tears saturate the plot. A perfect read for people who love slow burns.I'll wait to read Release because I really wanna know what the doctors'¬† prognosis is, cause the end kinda left me hanging !!!4 Hangry stars#BookBistroBlogApprovedFollow us onFB -https://www.facebook.com/groups/BookB...Blog -https://bookbistroblogcom.wordpress.comBlog -https://bookbistroblogger.blogspot.comTwitter -https://www.twitter.com/BookBistroInstagram -https://www.instagram.com/BookBistroBlog
