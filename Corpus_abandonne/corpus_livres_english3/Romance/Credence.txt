🎧 4th Read, Nov. 2021 — 5 StarsI’m praying HARD for A Noah Book. He deserves to have his story told.🎧 3rd Read, Oct. 2021 — 5 StarsYo, quit harassing/shaming me for loving and reading this shit multiple times.This book’s become more than just a guilty pleasure. I love the way it made me feel when I was reading it. I’mNOTtalking about the smut. There are scenes and passages that just hit me right in the chest. I don’t know if you get what I’m talking about, or if you at times feel it too. But sometimes when I’m reading something that (emotionally) affects me, I get thisstingingsensation in my chest like a heartburn or some shit. I get that a lot from this book, and I like it.I’m not saying the book isn’t problematic, but I also happen to think it’s a literary masterpiece and the author who wrote it a genius; for not only is it complex, but it’s also classy, believable, and brings forth an array of emotions. If you choose to see it only for itswrongness, and if you think it’s garbage and disgusting, that’s on you. You’re entitled to your opinions, just as I’m mine. What you’re not entitled to istellingME what to read and not to read, what to like and can’t/mustn’t like.Tis the last time I’m explaining/defending myself or I swear God help me![2nd Read]Dec. 2020 — 5 StarsMy alter ego and her inner slut is thrivinggg. Believe it, this is one of myfavorite books of 2020. Yes, we love me some sexy, juicy, spicy, saucy hanky panky debauchery.To say I’d been dyyying to get my hands on the audiobook and re-read this since January would be an understatement. So, it’s sad to admit that the audio wasn’t as good as I’d hoped it would be. Idk, the experience was just not as intense as reading the book conventionally.It could be because I listened in double speed. I’d say it was because I didn’t vibe with the narrator(s). Most of the time, I couldn’t tell the difference apart between her delivering the inner monologues and her actually reciting the dialogues. Audiobook wise, it’s 3 to 3.5 stars.Aside from that, I loved the story still. Every titillating, smutty, lascivious bit. I also still shippedKaleb with Tiernan. Not because they made sense, but they were perfect for each other. My heart went out toNoahbecause he was just so . . .goodor the least fucked up and he deserved better.I’d remind you to read thebonus scenesin PD’s website in case you’re interested. One of it is inKaleb’s POV, and I think reading it helps you get to know him more and shows you the side of him the book couldn’t but you’ve always wanted to see.This is probably the only book of its kind that I (was, am, and will ever be) obsessed with as I typically tend to stay away from anything ménage or reverse harem-ish.(Read as an Audiobook)[1st Read]Jan. 2020 — 4.5 StarsI’M SORRY FOR ANYONE WHO COULDN’T HANDLE THIS, BUT THIS BOOK ISITFOR MY GUILTY PLEASURE.Someone call the fire department because I need some cooling down! By the devil! That was oneheckof a ride. My my the heat… and the feels… oh the feels! Whew, this book is hotter than hell and wilder than my wildest fantasy.Following the sudden deaths of her parents, seventeen year oldTiernan de Haasis set to live with her father’s stepbrother and only living relativeJake Van der Bergand his two sons,KalebandNoah. Hidden in the mountains of Colorado and miles away from civilization, Tiernan, who grew up with wealth and her parents lack of affection and guidance, soon discovers thathome is not a place.It’s a feeling.As lines begin to blur and boundaries start to get crossed, Tiernan finds herself at a crossroad where emotions are clawing at her heart and demanding to be set free.Which one of them will she end up falling in love with? Who will get to keep her?“Something about this house, these people, lend credence every day to what I always knew I needed. Not sex. Not a guy. Just a place. Somewhere or someone to feel like home.”My favorite aspect about this book is undoubtedly thesetting. I love the idea of living in a secluded area near the wilderness, andthis book captures that ambiance perfectly.It’s so vivid that you can feel it with all your senses. It seems so mundane, but it’s also blissful and commendable seeing these characters go about their everyday life doing all kinds of domestic chores from cooking meals in the kitchen, to hunting in the forest and feeding livestock at the barn. Gah! I want nothing more than to teleport myself there and never leave the place. We don’t have winter here where I live, and reading this book has made me feel like I’ve lived vicariously through it.“Jake was holding onto his past and punishing himself, just like me. Noah had no one to talk to, just like me. Kaleb struggles to connect, because of his pain of being forgotten by someone who should’ve loved him enough never to forget. Just like me.”Thecharactersin this book are an absolute treat to read.You feel for them despite their undesirable traits and inexcusable behaviors. It’s beautiful seeing Tiernan’s transformation from someone who’s always lonely, empty, and not used to having people care about her into someone who grows to appreciate, trust, and love the people around her. You can say it’s misogynistic or whatever, but I have no problem with the Van der Bergs being possessive and protective of Tiernan.The different types ofrelationshipin this book are so blurrily intertwined that I wasn’t sure what these characters meant to each other. Lust, love, family, best friends, lovers? They’re all tangled into one. And because these characters are not afraid to explore themselves and push their limits,they keep you on your toes.You’ll never know what’s going to happen. I do agree that the development of Tiernan’s romantic relationship near the end of the book is quite rushed. Some say it’s unbelievable and insta lovey. But let me tell you where I stand on this,The book is told frommultiple perspectivesof all the four main characters, though it’s mostly just Tiernan’s. While her POV certainly helps understand all the characters,it’s a little bit challenging to connect with one of the Van der Bergsconsidering his “limitation” and that he has the least interaction with Tiernan. I would’ve liked to have gotten more chapters from their POVs. Strangely enough though, this character also wound up to be the one I rooted for the most.Thesteamy scenesin this book are one of the most erotic and intense I’ve ever read. One of it(the threesome with the boys)honestly was really disorienting for me because there were a lot of motions going on. Obviously if it were up to me I wouldn’t let the smut get this far(Tiernan having sex with all the Van der Bergs). However, considering the nature of this book, extreme as it may be, I think it’s also fitting. Not to mention, I appreciatethe author being so free with her words and painting something that most see as negative to be liberating and empowering.“My home is where you are.”CREDENCEmight not be everyone’s cup of tea, but it is mine. Read this book if you’re seeking foran exceptional, thrilling, and treacherous taboo forbidden romance read with some age gap theme and reverse harem feel to it. Make sure you leave your prejudices and beliefs at the door to fully immerse yourself in it. This book will have you reeling by the end.It’s dark, sexy, romantic, heartbreaking, unconventional, and suspenseful. Mixed with complex characters, atmospheric setting, and the author’s alluring story telling, this book will guarantee passage to one of the wildest (and most uncomfortable) rides you’ve ever had in your reading life.
