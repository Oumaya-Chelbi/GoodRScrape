Looking for a good pick me up book? Love a female main character who isn’t a pushover and has sass for days? Want HOT men who make your mouth water? Looking for a full length stand-alone to tide you over until the next book in your favorite series releases? Want to laugh your butt off? Need a book to get you through a life funk? Don’t want the MC to have to choose between love interests? Love STEAMY scenes? Enjoy a little M/M action? Well A Naughty Santa Gram is all that and so much more!!!This book is HOT!!! I know that I enjoyed it so much I had this stupid grin on my face the ENTIRE book because the hubby asked me what I was reading that had me so happy and I was just like only the best book I’ve read in a while. I decided to start reading before bed and that was the biggest mistake of my life because I HAD to finish it; I could NOT put it down and am now running on 2 hours of sleep. It’s like a container of Pringle’s: once you pop, the fun don’t stop. Seriously, great. Go on and click to get it now, you will not regret it.A Naughty Santa Gram is a full length stand-alone and Ms. Mynx has managed to give us an amazingly well developed story. You know how sometimes you read a stand-alone and you’re left wanting so much more because the characters are just bland and the story feels rushed? Well you will not be left hanging with this one. Seriously, I cannot give enough praise to Ms. Mynx for this amazing written book. She has easily moved onto my favorite authors list with this hit. Another plus? The editing is spot on, which is so hard to find nowadays.If you have triggers (read the author’s trigger warning) or have anything against reverse harems or a little M/M action, then this book is not for you.
