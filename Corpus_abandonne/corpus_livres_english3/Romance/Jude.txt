JUDE is the second book in the BLACK ROSES MC by @katerandallThis is a story about a girl who grows up into a strong brave woman that tries hard to get herself out of an impossible situation in a society that sees women as nothing worth more than bearing and raising kids and serving their husbands.Lucinda was born in a family that is a part of a religious doomsday cult that lived in the Nevada desert where elders believe that a war is coming. In this cult women are belittled and physically abused by their husbands. Girls are kidnapped and forced into marriage and if they try to escape and they get captured they are then whipped and beaten by a group of elders (men) in the name of seeking repentance.I know religions are absurdly and so outrightly out of line this days but in this book the things this people do felt so waaay out of line. The double standards between the men and women was just so unbelievably painful to read. Boys are treated like princes and girls like demons.Lucinda is then betrothed to a guy 2yrs older than him a son of another elder in the church. And she’s just not having it so she runs away from home to New Orleans where she meets her best-friend Charlie. In New Orleans she experiences a whole different view on how men treat their women. Here men treat their women with respect and kindness and they would lay their lives to protect them and their families.Her and Charlie then move to a little town called Shine in Massachusetts where she starts working a bar owned by a biker gang. And she blends in perfectly and finds new family and makes new friends. She also meets Jude here.Jude is perfect for her; British, 6ft 3, loves being in jeans and t-shirts and is the leader of the biker gang. This two aren’t exactly close; in-fact they fight lots BUTHE respects her he’s protective and possessive of her. The minute he thinks her safety is in question he rans to rescue her. cares for her; somehow they get along and with time a certain ease develops between them and with that something comes deeper feelings.But that is cut short when Lucinda is found by the Nevada cult and they would do anything to take her back home for punishment as a lesson for everyone else who tries to run!After that i was blown away by everything that happened.
