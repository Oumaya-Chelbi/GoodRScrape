Trigger Warnings:Cancer, death of parents, home invasion, rape resulting in unwanted pregnancy, neglectful parents, ending pet lives when they are in pain (euthanasia), kinda cheating? (MMC prioritizing OW over the FMC and even sharing a bed with her but it didn’t go into detail. MMC says nothing happened, has history with OW and didn’t tell FMC)“Either he loves me enough to choose me, or he doesn’t. I refuse to fight for a man to pick me.”Mel🌜recommended this to me and I decided to give it a go and I loved it. It is an angsty book, there is built-up betrayal which results in grovelling in the second half. When I was reading, I would be crying for our girl Aspen. Ryan, the MMC, pissed me off and there are things I wish we saw from his POV because I’m not sure what exactly happened. Regardless, I enjoyed this book and found the grovel satisfying. Realistically, I wouldn’t deal with the shit that Ryan did in the real world, but in the fictional world, I would forgive him. I haven’t read the author's other books but heard that some of the other characters have books. You don’t have to read the books in order since I read this book first and didn’t have issues following the story. This was an addicting read, I finished it in one sitting and recommend it to everyone.Aspen has been blissfully in love with Ryan and they’ve been living together for a year. Ryan claims to love Aspen but when he tells her that his friend is coming from London to live in his old apartment, Aspen starts having doubts. Slowly, Ryan, the most attentive loving boyfriend, turns into a forgetful inconsiderate boyfriend.Now for spoilersAspen works in an animal hospital, her father died from a heart attack and her mother died from cancer. When she met Ryan, they dated for 6 months and Ryan rushed them to move in together. Ryan is rich since he has a job in computer science. He encouraged Aspen to use her money to make the rescue shelter she’s always wanted and insisted he cover the house expenses. Aspen didn’t like taking his money and contributed to the groceries. That was the only argument they had during their relationship. He wants to support her financially but Aspen wants to be independent (I don’t blame her). They watch shows, they cuddle, and they are happy. That is until Ryan asks Aspen if it would be okay for his friend to live in his old apartment, she is from London. Her name is Hadley and he visited her twice in London. Hadley has a sick parent in their small town. On the day Hadley was coming, Ryan had plans with Aspen to meet with their friends after he helped Hadley settle in. But he texts Aspen that Hadley is exhausted and he can’t come so Aspen leaves to meet her. Aspen overhears Ryan and Hadley laughing, Hadley doesn’t look exhausted. Despite that, Aspen tried to get to know Hadley. They send Hadley off to her apartment but the next day, Hadley needs Ryan to drive her to meet her father at the hospital. Ryan was supposed to help Aspen throw some heavy things out of her rescue shelter but he didn’t show up or text her. Aspen decides to do it herself and gets herself injured with splinters and a gash on her arm.Ryan apologizes, feeling guilty when he sees she is injured. Aspen is in her PJs and Hadley walks into their house. The idiot Ryan gave her a spare key to his house without asking Aspen. He claims that his house is Aspen’s house, but he doesn’t ask her if she would be comfortable with Hadley having a key to their home. Then he takes Hadley to the hospital again. Once he is back and kisses Aspen, she tastes alcohol since he went out to lunch with Hadley without telling her. Aspen cooked dinner and Ryan said Hadley was coming over without asking Aspen. Aspen was hoping that they could eat and watch shows alone but Ryan says they can do that with Hadley. When they are going to watch shows, Hadley sits on the couch with Ryan, where Aspen normally sits, and cuddles up next to him. Aspen gives Ryan looks and he looks at her apologetically. Ryan says he sees Hadley as a sister and nothing more, and that Aspen is the only girl that he loves. He repeats this while actively hurting Aspen. In Ryan’s POV, we discover Hadley’s home was invaded. Her mother was raped which resulted in an unwanted pregnancy with Hadley so her parents neglected her. Her mom died and now her dad is sick. They were friends in first grade because he saw that Hadley’s parents didn’t come to their school performance. Ryan’s father was a lawyer working on the case and Ryan vowed to always be there for Hadley. Hadley dares to comment about Aspen’s work life but Ryan defends Aspen.Aspen asks Ryan why Hadley’s situation concerns him so much and he says that he can’t tell her since Hadley wouldn’t want that, that Hadley has no one but him. This was cuz Hadley told him not to tell anyone since she didn’t want to be pitied. Aspen has a bad day at work where she has to put a dog down and texts Ryan to get the wine ready, it's her SOS message to him when she has a bad day. When she gets home, she finds Ryan and Hadley in a hot tub laughing and drinking. Aspen feels so defeated and goes to get the wine but Hadley finishes it. Aspen is angry that Ryan is half-naked with Hadley in their hot tub. It was a hot tub she surprised Ryan with. Aspen tells Ryan that she had a bad day and thought he would be ready for her but he is here half-naked with Hadley. He says that Hadley is like his sister, he didn’t see her message since his phone was in his office. When Aspen asked him how he would feel if she did it with one of his guy friends, he said that it would be different. He has different rules and standards for her that he doesn’t follow. Aspen leaves and tells her friends Maya, Rose, and Piper. Ryan’s sister Rose says that she doesn’t like Hadley. At home, Hadley tells Aspen that she is overreacting since it was just a dog that died. Aspen is pissed that Ryan told Hadley about her business but respects Hadley’s privacy. When she calls Ryan out, Ryan is more pissed with her for leaving in the middle of their argument. She tells him that she doesn’t want Hadley at their house anymore. Ryan says the person causing issues is Aspen, not Hadley. Aspen feels unwanted and ignored, but Ryan tries to be more attentive and affectionate. Nothing feels real to Aspen since she feels like he is doing it to appease her. Aspen trusted Ryan and put her money into the rescue shelter, she barely has enough to move out and start over. When she goes over to Ryan’s parents’ house with him and Hadley, they leave her to sit in a gazebo. He sits close to Hadley and they look like a couple. When Aspen tells Ryan he looked cozy with Hadley, he says it meant nothing as usual.Hadley says that she planned dinner with Ryan and their old college friends. Aspen feels numb and tired, I cried when she talked about how she missed her mom and how she never felt this alone until now. They meet with Nicole and Benjamin, the college friends. Aspen tries to join in on the conversation but they all ignore her. She leaves to see if they will notice but they never do. Ryan makes no effort to include her and didn’t notice she was gone. Aspen sat at the bar instead of rejoining them. She gets hit on by this guy named Derick. Aspen says she is there with her boyfriend and Derick says it looked like she was there alone. He thought that Hadley and Ryan were dating. Ryan interrupts them and Derick leaves while Ryan is pissed. Aspen uses her phone and Ryan asks if they exchanged numbers. Ryan says she is on her phone after he caught her with a stranger. Aspen says that it's ironic coming from him when he and his friends ignored her. Ryan asks if Aspen left to get his attention and she is so upset. She tells him she was ordering a ride while he insinuates that she cheated and will share her location if he doubts her. Ryan says he didn’t mean it but Aspen says it doesn’t matter. She tells him to go have fun with his friends. Ryan begs her to stay but Aspen can’t stand being in his presence. He used to bring her comfort but now, all she wants to do is get away from him.Ryan rushes through dinner and when he is driving home, Hadley says she made plans with Nicole and Benjamin again for tomorrow. Ryan didn’t think this was good since he kept making plans without talking to Aspen. But Hadley would cry and he would feel bad. Aspen was sleeping on her side, facing away from him. In the morning, he apologizes and Aspen tells him exactly how she is feeling. She tells him she doesn’t feel important and it hurts her that he insulted her character. Aspen says he didn’t ask her when he gave Hadley the spare key and she feels uncomfortable that Hadley can come over any time. Ryan hugs her and says he was wrong and will fix things since he loves her. He tells Aspen that they have dinner again with Nicole and Benjamin. During the dinner, Nicole brings up how Hadley used to be married to Ryan. This had me shook because the entire time, he told Aspen he saw Hadley as a sister. Nicole and Hadley were smug while Ryan asked Aspen to wait. Even when they try to talk, Hadley follows them which pisses Aspen off. Aspen goes over to her friend’s place and Rose has no idea Ryan is married and same with her parents. When Aspen goes home, Ryan is at the apartment with Hadley. When Ryan returns, he says that Hadley’s dad died. He knows they need to talk but Hadley needs him. He doesn’t come to their bed that night and this is the main thing that pissed me off. Don’t get me wrong, everything he did pissed me off, but he spent multiple nights with Hadley at the apartment which only has ONE bed. We don’t see his POV so we don’t know what is going on. During the times Ryan is home, Aspen has shut him out. When Ryan is in the mood, he tells her that he married Hadley in college when she was going through things after her mom died. After 5 months together, 1 month of them being intimate, he asked for a divorce. He didn’t see Hadley romantically since they were better off friends. Hadley got a job offer in London, she left since there were too many painful memories. They barely kept in touch and they weren’t intimate when he went to visit her twice. He says he only loves Aspen but she is questioning every interaction Hadley and Ryan have had.Ryan wants Aspen at the funeral but tells her to drive on her own since his parents and Rose will be in his car with Hadley. If there wasn’t space for Aspen in the car, he could have left with Aspen but nope. During the funeral, Ryan was by Hadley’s side the entire time. Aspen felt that she came to a funeral for her relationship. While Aspen is alone, Hadley admits she acted the entire time and didn’t care that her dad died since she didn’t know him. She says that she loves Ryan and he loves her so they will get back together. Hadley tells Aspen to ask Ryan what their plans are for Saturday. When Aspen tells Ryan everything, Hadley acts shocked and starts crying. Ryan doesn’t believe Aspen and says that this is not the time or place. Aspen heads home feeling numb. When Ryan gets home, he says that her behaviour was uncalled for. Aspen asks what he plans to do on Saturday. He promised Hadley to go on a honeymoon when they were getting divorced. They got married in college when they were broke. He didn’t want to make Hadley feel unwanted so he agreed to the trip. He asks Aspen if it is okay and Aspen says everything she thinks doesn’t matter.Aspen leaves the second Ryan leaves with Hadley. She moves to a motel and Ryan’s friend Carter says that she can live with him if she can cook him some meals and turn a blind eye to his hookups. Carter bickers a lot with Rose so I hope we get their story sometime, he’s sweet and funny. Maya is treated like shit because her boss Nathan has a girlfriend named Cassie who keeps messing with her. When Aspen meets with her friends, Ryan calls her from the resort. Ryan was trying to check in, but the staff said only one room was booked. Ryan insists on getting a separate room but that won’t happen for another three days. Hadley says they have shared a bed before and he says that is different. This is what I mean, I need Ryan to clarify what exactly went on when he stayed with Hadley at the apartment. They shared a bed and I don’t know how the fuck he thought that was okay. Especially cuz his house was downstairs and he could have slept in his own bed and then gone to Hadley. He is freaking out about sharing a bed with her at the resort but didn’t think it was an issue before? The fuck?He calls Aspen and Hadley walks out in a towel. He yells at Hadley to put clothes on and Hadley loudly asks what side of the bed he wants. Aspen hangs up on him, she makes his calls go to voicemail. Ryan realizes that Aspen was right and Hadley emotionally manipulates him to get what she wants. He says he loves Aspen and leaves since he knew he fucked up. He told Hadley never to contact him again. When Ryan gets home, he notices all of Aspen’s stuff is gone. Ryan goes to Aspen’s vet job and begs her to talk. When he starts apologizing, Aspen says it doesn’t matter anymore and shuts him out. He kept saying it does matter and he loves her but Aspen looks at him with no emotions. He asks to talk again and she says she is busy until the weekend. Carter helped another girl named Alice in the past. Alice is a stripper and asked Aspen if she could do waitressing since Aspen needed money. Ryan tells his parents what happened. His mother felt bad for Aspen and his dad blames himself since he told Ryan about Hadley’s situation. Aspen meets Ryan and he says he was wrong about everything. Aspen says she was raised in a loving home even though her parents had nothing. She cries and says she feels unwanted and not like a priority. Carter tells Ryan that Aspen lives with him and is safe. Carter says that she is waitressing at a strip club. Ryan blames himself for the financial situation Aspen is in and goes to the strip club. Ryan says it isn’t safe for Aspen to do this job. He says he will give her money and she doesn’t want any of his money. Since she doesn’t listen, he waits outside for her shifts to end and follows her car home to make sure she gets home safely every shift.Ryan can’t stand being in the house without Aspen and feels it is tainted with memories of Hadley. He decides he is going to sell the house and give the money to Aspen secretly. He texts Aspen everyday to remind her that he loves her. He paints Aspen’s rescue shelter but Aspen yells at him for doing it. Hadley comes to Ryan’s house and tells him that Aspen isn’t worth it but Ryan tells her to get out. When their friends get together, Ryan would say hi to Aspen and stare at her. Maya had a gallery opening, she was sad that Nathan didn’t show up. Aspen ran into Derick and he asked her out for drinks. Ryan sees them and looks like he is dealing with loss and grief. Ryan asks his parents if he can move back in and works with Carter and Aspen’s friends to help Aspen raise money for her rescue shelter. Aspen asks her friends out for plans but they have to meet Ryan. Aspen meets with Derick and sees all her friends in the restaurant without her. She is hurt, thinking they met up without her. Derick feels bad and kisses her, saying it was to remind her that she is beautiful. Aspen’s friends say they are planning something but can’t tell her. Hadley tries to talk to Ryan in front of their friends and he defends Aspen and says how he fucked up his relationship cuz of her. The strip club bodyguard notices that Ryan’s car following Aspen. Ryan texts her not to worry since it is just him. She yells at him and cries so Ryan hugs her and apologizes. Aspen hates that he ruined their relationship. Aspen goes over to their house to see if she can talk to Ryan. Since Ryan sold the house, he isn’t there and she texts him asking if he moved. During the fundraiser, Ryan sneaks in the cheque with the money he made from the house and Aspen realizes it. She told him she won’t take his money. He apologizes and says he loves her but Aspen pushes him away. She knows he loves her but she can’t trust him, so he says he wants to court her. The fundraiser helped raise money for the rescue shelter and gave Aspen future opportunities.Ryan lives with his parents and continues to court Aspen. He takes things slow with her and their first date was to the movies. They watch 10 Things I Hate About You and after the movie, he asks Aspen what she hates about him. She tells him everything he did wrong but she also tells him she hates that she misses him. They went on multiple dates and after months, they went home and fucked. In the morning, Rose calls them to say Maya is missing. After two years of dating, Ryan bought land so that he could live with Aspen in a house they built themselves. Ryan proposes to Aspen and she says yes. They mention how time was frozen for 2 years because of something that had happened. I think it is related to Maya being missing. I found the grovel to be satisfying since we can see Ryan couldn’t sleep or do anything without Aspen. He went through emotional torment like she did. What still irks me is him sleeping at Hadley’s place right after it was revealed he used to be married to her. Even if her dad died, I don’t know how it justifies sleeping in the same bed as her. I wish we got his POV when that happened, Hadley definitely would have cuddled him. I loved the way Aspen handled herself and how she voiced her opinions. Ryan is an idiot but his grovel was good. I loved the friend group looking out for one another and look forward to future stories by this author.Stay safe folks!
