sigh. nobody is more sad and disappointed about this rating than me. there were clowns in the book but i feariam the clown for thinking this was gonna be the best in the series.it isby farthe worst.!!! i did mark/cover spoilers but ik goodreads can be glitchy about that sometimes so beware just in case !!!let’s talk about the timeline first of all because i do think that’s where the story really failed for me. around 80% of the book takes place during the same time as b&b and l&l, and then the last part picks up at the scene with rose at the end of l&l. but then that last part isliterally the characters not even being together. it felt like i was just reading the same things over again even with the different povs.and even when rose and fionn were off doing their own thing, it felt like nothing was happening. like truly, what even happened in this? the plot was nonexistent. the first maybe 20% or so started off so promising but then we strayed from the plot, seemingly forgot about it, then made it flat and anticlimactic when we came back to it.i thought rose and fionn were not only going to be my favorite couple, but also my favorite characters.wrong. so wrong.all the characters in this series felt pretty underdeveloped and two dimensional to me, but it wassobad with these two. literally all we knew about them wasfionn not wanting to be dark? and rose trying to be a vigilante but not having the stomach for it?and when the characters are so bland and fall so flat, it’s hard to really care about what happens to them.which brings me to the romance. sort of insta-lusty, which is the exact opposite of what i expected. (see: pre read, where i expected “angst, angst, and more angst”). there was a forced proximity which could’ve ate so hard but didn’t. there was a one bed moment that was such a missed opportunity. and overall i just didn’t feel the chemistry between them. this is definitely a physical attraction first situation, which i wouldn’t mind if i feltanychemistry. there was NONE. the banter was even lacking. and the spice wasn’t really spicing. like, at least give me one thing to enjoy about them.the time jumps also made it hard for me to really feel the growth and progression of the romance. it’s the most random parts where it’s suddenly “one year later” or even an unlabeled “it’s been a few weeks” ... like huh??? it’s impossible to see the growth when it’s just randomly jumping days and weeks and months.going off of that (sorta), i didn’t like the writing. which is weird because it didn’t bother me in the first two books, but this one felt like all tell and no show. it was still bingeable, but i found myself rolling my eyes and constantly checking the percentage on my kindle after like 60%. i just wanted it to end because i couldn’t feel the story moving at all.and the second epilogue?? are we really leaving this open for a spinoff series?? i hate that so many authors do this when their books get popular. like move ON!!! write books with other characters and in other worlds!!! i can’t say i’d read more books set in this same timeline/world.overall suchhhh a let down. i am so bummed that this sucked so bad because i really was so excited for it. what i thought would be my favorite book in the series turned out to be a victim of a rant review. and honestly the series just went downhill as a whole. but anyway, what should’ve been a legendary couple just turned out to be a lackluster story. i am glad i finished the series at least.pre readi expect angst, angst, and more angst 🫡
