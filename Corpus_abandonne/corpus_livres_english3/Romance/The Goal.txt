“Got a moment?”“For you, always.”i don’t find it surprising that i ended up liking the book that everyone else didn’t really like.i had the impression i was gonna like this one much more than the previous ones. tucker was a side character we first meet inthe deal, and he was one i really liked and was anticipating learning more about. i was excited to read his story, and i’m honestly glad i’m not too disappointed.the goalfollows john tucker and sabrina james as they navigate through the fact that, after an unexpected moment, sabrina gets pregnant with tucker’s baby. this is the ending/epilogue ofthe score, and when i read it, i was already looking forward to the book.i've been wanting to readthe dealsince 2016. i was 15/16 when i considered reading the first book, and i gotta say,i'm glad i didn't.15/16-year-old me would have definitely loved every book in this series and fallen for all the men. i would have definitely overlooked the flaws i saw in every book and thought of them as some of the best. but alas, we all grow and change (not that there is anything wrong with liking these books, i mean my taste(s) and interest(s) in books have changed a lot).i tend to always to find myself on the minority side when it comes to popular books/series. having given the rest of the three books 2 stars, this 3 star read felt like a total refreshment. i’m definitely on the minority because even though i’m rating this 3 stars, i enjoyed it a lot more than the previous books, and it’s only made me more excited to readthe legacyand see how far tucker and sabrina have come, especially little jamie. yes, i gave it 3 stars, which is what i have seen most people give this, but those people also rated the previous books 4 or 5 stars. in my opinion, both tucker and sabrina are underrated.🚨this review will have spoilers forthe scoreas well as spoilers for this book🚨“Tell me exactly what you want.”“You. I want you.”i loved sabrina.the previous books don’t give us an insight into her persona besides hinting at a bad reputation. she’s referred to as toxic by dean (fromthe score) and he also calls her a bitch. there’s never really a reason this happens besides the fact that they hooked up and he knows better than to do it again.the unexpected baby trope is not one everyone likes, and i totally understand why, but i liked how it was executed here. i didn’t find it to be done ridiculously, and i found it to be a cute addition to the story. it added to sabrina’s character to show how strong she is and how difficult motherhood is.motherhood is so underrated. it’s a separate unpaid full-time job, and mamas don’t get the appreciation they deserve sometimes. while for some it may feel unrealistic, i found sabrina to be the version of she-hulk, as tucker described her. she managed to continue with her pregnancy, birth her child, continue writing school papers, continue passing her classes, attend law school, suffer through her step dad's creepiness and harassment, and somehow still make it out alive. because of this (and more), i sympathized with her and the reputation she had. she was clearly judged for the image given to her, but sabrina was completely different than how she was represented. she had no one, not even her nana was someone who was trustworthy in every aspect, but she didn't allow herself to stop from achieving her goals and continuing her journey forward. i found her to be nothing but strong and determined, and i was rooting for her throughout the entire the novel.Because love is the ultimate goal. It’s not the one I had strived for, but I was lucky enough, so damn lucky, to achieve it.as she and tucker get to know each other more, she opens up to him, and we see this vulnerable, out-going, bright girl who is trying to get to law school and become a lawyer. i think another reason why i enjoyed her character is that i also want to go to law school and become a lawyer. seeing how she never gave up is inspiring and shows how goal-oriented and determined she was/is. i also found her to be adorable and cute all while also being intelligent, driven, and someone who was hanging on by a thread on many occasions. people were rude to her in many parts of the book, and while it could have made hear weak, i loved seeing how she managed to stick up for herself.for example, her confrontation with tucker’s mother towards the end had me smiling with proudness. i disliked tucker’s mom so much. i hated how judgmental she was, and she was someone who accused sabrina of someone she wasn’t. she misread and misjudged her without even getting to know her, and she reminded me of the type of mother-in-laws who think you’re going to be putting all the work and pressure on the man. this is really upsetting because she’s a mother herself, and i thought she should have tried and understood sabrina’s current situation.“I have so much respect for you. I’ve only been doing this mothering sh—stuff for four months and I’ve screwed up probably a thousand times. It’s hard, and I have Tucker, your amazing son, helping me every inch of the way. I can’t imagine how you did it on your own. But I’m not going to let you insult everything I do in this place. This is my home. Yes, I’m not perfect, but I’m trying. I love Jamie and I love Tucker and if, at any time, Harvard or work or anything threatens their happiness in any way, I would give it all up in a minute.”i also really liked tucker, but before getting to what i liked about him, i do have to say that his character in the beginning really bothered me.i hated theathlete privilege cardhe pulled out and managed to track down sabrina after their hook up. she told him there wouldn’t be anything else after that besides that one night stand that she even blocked him, and it’s why he tracked her down. he was able to do this by asking his advisor and somehow, his advisor gave him her schedule and was even pleased to do it. this completely invaded sabrina’s privacy and i really hated how it was something that was done in the first place. advisors cannot do this, no matter who the student asking for it is. advisors can be sued for this and is a total invasion of privacy. no advisor can give another students class schedule and any other information related to the academics of said students. this is really unrealistic and is not something that is allowed in universities, such as the athlete privilege card not existing as well. yes, there are stories and moments of rich families paying universities to accept their students and such. even if universities were paid to leak out personal information of the student without their permission, there are law suits that would be made and filed.considering this is fiction, it can be a quick pass, but it was something i didn’t like and found annoying, disturbing, and even disgusting, especially because sabrina blocked tucker's number and he decided to track her down one way or another. it showed creepy behavior, and it’s just overall gross.with that aside though, tucker wasn’t ever really someone that got on my nerves, per se, besides those creepy/stalkerish moments.tucker is (currently) my favorite briar u boy.i liked him in the previous books, and i liked him in his own. sure, i find the lust in all four books to be ridiculously quick and too fast paced for my liking, and the love tucker felt for sabrina was quicker than hers, but i liked him. i never found him to be as cocky as the other guys, and i really appreciated how he was someone who didn’t back out of the pregnancy when sabrina told him. instead, i found his character to be charming, protective, and overall, loving. the chemistry between the two developed quickly, and admittedly, it was one i felt more sparks between compared to the other couples. if you asked me, my favorites go tucker and sabrina > logan and grace > graham and hannah > dean and allie.i liked tucker as a character and as a father.the fact that both are young parents scared me, mostly because i’m also in college and can’t imagine getting pregnant at my current age, but i thought they both managed well, for both the baby and themselves. they set their priorities straight and i found both of them to work at a steady pace, all while working together as well.i also found tucker and sabrina to be the cutest of the three couples before them. i mentioned how i felt their chemistry more than the rest, and i think part of that really has to do with the fact that there was an unexpected pregnancy. i was glad both of them didn’t back out from it or blame the other. instead, they talked about it and worked it out and realized that it was going to be the new life they would have to get used to. i found tucker’s support to be really sweet and supportive throughout the whole process. yes, he’s cocky and flirtatious, but compared to the other members, i found him to be the most mature. i loved his growing love for sabrina and i enjoyed reading about his development towards her. i loved how he stood up for her and hated how people misjudged and misread her.“You’re not alone,” he says, fierce and low. “And you’re not dragging anyone down. I’m here with you, Sabrina. Every step of the way.”however, to add some criticism to my own liking of the couple, one thing i didn’t really like was how “unofficial” they felt. neither tucker nor sabrina ever really confirmed their relationship status, even after tucker told the rest of the gang the news. this is something that i noticed in the previous books as well. i know the love admitting is difficult, because let’s face it, it’s a difficult thing to confess even if you feel it, but what really bothered me about all the books is how the relationship status between the two characters was never really “a thing” until towards the end. maybe it’s just me, but this sort of lack of communication really irks me. it’s a small thing, but it’s still bothersome to me because of how much impact it makes in the overall relationship.not only that, but another thing i noticed in all four books is how many pretty words and comments are lacking. this is something i tried shrugging off after the first book, but i noticed it was a problem in book 2 and 3, only to see that book 4 didn’t really have it either. this is another reason why the chemistry between the couples didn’t always click with me quickly or at all, and why i struggled piecing the two together. i’ve read a few romance novels now, and while there was flirting, since there was never that “official dating status” moment, the couples never really . . . complimented each other besides the basic “you’re beautiful” comments. i don’t know if this is just something i noticed or am mentioning, but it was annoying because it made the romance pretty damn absent, if you ask me. an example is this:“You’re the only one for me.My sun rises and sets on your smile.My heart beats because yours does.”that is something tucker thought when he and sabrina were having sex towards the end (98% in the novel), and it happened a little in the previous books too.another example is this:“You’re the one, Sabrina. There’s no one else for me in this world, nobody but you. If I was driving and saw you on the side of the road? You better believe I’d rip out a spark plug or two if it meant getting to spend even five seconds in your presence. You’re the fucking one.”that was like, the only moment i highlighted of “cute talk” from tucker to sabrina. i don’t know if i’m making sense or if i’m explaining something others see. but anyway, i expected more . . . complimenting? i didn't even highlight a lot in the book because there was hardly anything that i felt was highlight-worthy. this is a personal preference/issue though.give me all that cute mutual pining and romantic talk. there was more sex and flirting than romance, in my opinion.the pace of this book can definitely falter the overall enjoyment because of how it takes place before, during, and afterthe score. beau’s death takes place in both books, and we see part of dean’s grief process in this book as well. this wasn’t something that bothered me. as a matter of fact, i liked seeing part of the other book in this book because it gave me two different perspectives of the same situation. i understand how this can bother some readers, as it can affect the pace of the book. for the most part, i loved getting to read about the side characters (graham, hannah, logan, grace, dean, and allie),but dean got on my nerves in this book.he was rude and a jerk in this book to both sabrina and tucker, but mostly sabrina.i don’t understand how he thought he had the right to be judging sabrina and tucker when he’s had his life to fix himself. i appreciated the support of the other members and girls when they told them the news, but i found dean to be an asshole and immature. he hooked up with sabrina in the past (sophomore year), and it is something that has fed on to the reputation sabrina has on campus. it made me upset how immature dean reacted to the news when 1) it’s not his child or life, so i don’t understand why he thought asking tucker “why didn’t she get an abortion” was a good idea 2) he’s literally known as a man whore, and as someone who has had his dick inside (almost) every girl on campus 3) literally turned to molly and other drugs after beau’s death to deal with the grief process, got kicked out of the team after the drug test, and lacked communication with allie throughout their relationship. he blamed sabrina and told her she was ruining tucker’s life and literally made her cry. he tried pushing her to tell tucker she loves him, and while i agreed that yes, tell your man you love him, it was so stupid to me how dean himself was pushy about it. last i recall, he didn’t even realize when he told allie he loves her because, you know, the poor boy has never done relationships so it was difficult for him in the first place. ah yes, way to try and make someone feel bad for not telling them they love them even though they do. not to mention, he even made it seem like he was going to tell him because “he needs to know.” yeah, his attitude just got on my nerves and i hated how he took the news.everything dean related in this book reminded me of how women are called sluts and whores for hooking up with one person and another but men are praised for it and even looked at with glory.that’s how different the reputation of dean and sabrina was. she was considered a slut and whore and he was praised as a sex god basically. this mentality still exists in 2021, and i find it extremely unattractive. i don’t care if it’s fiction or not, it’s wrong, ignorant, and overall judgmental. it shows people’s hypocrisy and true colors when you judge someone for their sexual life and activity. not to mention that i found dean to actually be conceited and not confident in many parts of his book. he’s the typical NA college hockey player who knows he can get any girl he wants, can’t believe a girl would reject him, and knows he’s good in bed. i didn’t find tucker to be like this, and it was a refreshment because the other 2 (graham and logan) were a little like dean.also, this is just apersonal problem, but i am tired of having to read text conversations/messages where the sentences and words aren't complete!!! i can't stand words like 2nite, tmrw, c u 2day, l8r, etc, etc. please, type the whole word. i can understandurbut . . . that's really it. this isn't something that affected my enjoyment of the book, it was just something annoying in all four books.overall, this is my favorite of the series. i’m not too surprised with myself, considering how i liked both characters throughout most of the novel. i’m also just a whore for men with babies.the scorehad some scenes with dean training middle school kids (which is how he came to realize he wanted to be a gym teacher instead and let go of law school, which, i found to beveryadorable, and his scenes with dakota were so wholesome), and i found them to be nothing but adorable, but this book had baby content everywhere. i’m weak for muscular men with tiny humans, especially men built like what these boys are described as. every scene tucker had with his little girl brought a smile to my face.yes, i'm going to readthe legacywhen it comes out, and yes, i will be reading the spin-off of this series, starting withthe chase. i tell myself that i shouldn't go into them with expectations and overall excitement because i'm scared i'll be let down again and again, but sometimes my excitement gets the best of me. i wish my self luck.“We all hurt. We all love. We’re the same. And your past, who you live with, where you came from, it doesn’t have to matter. You’re creating your own future, and I want to see where the road forward takes you.”
