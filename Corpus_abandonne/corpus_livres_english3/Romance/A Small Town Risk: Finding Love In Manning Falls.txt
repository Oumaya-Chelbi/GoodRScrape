Reads like a diary entry, but has a good plot.The premise of the book is good, but I was not a fan of the writing style. Instead of experiencing the relationship progression, it read like diary entries for the entire book. I read the first book and had the same issue, but it didn’t feel as bad. This book, book 2, was just too much. The only thing that was ever described to have you experience it was sex scenes and random slices of life in their day, everything else was just presented as fact and stated, as in this happened, then I did this, s/he said this, I did this, and then this happened. If that style of writing is what you enjoy, give the series a try because it is interesting. I just can’t get into that style and will be calling it quits with this one.
