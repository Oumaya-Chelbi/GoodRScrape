Rating:2.8 / 5WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!!!Oh this one, I was just kind of...meh.Neutral.___________________________________If I had to sum up what exactly didn't hit the mark for me, I think I could narrow it down to two major things:1. Erika did not feel like a genuine character,and2. No one's reactions felt real enough or passionate enoughAhem, now to break it down in more detail.The Problem with ErikaBasically, Erika doesn't read like orfeellike a 42-year-old woman. The main reason why I tried out this book was because the older woman + younger man trope isn't used that often, and so, having few reference points, I fully admit to expecting something like The Graduate.The problem though, is that where The Graduate does this troperightin very much having the older woman take the lead, being confident, and dominant in nature, Erika isn't really any of that except in spurts and moments. Like...It's less of THISand more of THISin terms of how Erika's acting and what's going on. At one point she even says to Troy that she feels like a virgin, which, pardon my saying so, is complete bullshit at 42 unless you actually ARE a virgin. And Erika, ahem, is definitely not. (And this also makes it less believable when a few pages later she's gone into full cougar-mode. *rolls eyes*)Ahem, so yeah, I don't think that the author really sold well on that point. Maybe an older woman character is just harder to write in romances? Maybe that's it, and only a few authors can really hit the mark.I feel no shame in saying that Nikki Sloane most certainly didnot.The Problem With Everyone ElseAnd now comes the second reason/flaw with this book--that no one's reactions felt "real" enough. I've already gone over my problems with Erika enough, so I'm now going to switch gears to everyone else.Specifically, Troy, his mother, Jenna, and Erika's ex-husband, Clark.In Troy's case, it's almost Dr. Jekyll-Mr.Hyde-ish how he switches from being confident one minute to being all nervous and hesitant the next, from being submissive to being dominant and so on. Now, that's not to say that a person can't be all these things in different situations, but with Troy, the transitions happen from one page to the next with...really no smoothness to them. It feels like he was written in such a contrived manner to just suit the plot and what Erika "needed" at any given moment, that he could easily switch from being "a horny boy" to being Mr. Effing-fantastic-dominant-daddy in zero to one seconds.Also, and I'm sorry, but I didn't completely buy into his crush on Erika either.Five years?! And just because he heard her sing a song and then "privately" tell her husband how she wanted him to fuck her? Like, okay, I can buy into a temporary lust because of that, but not a five year (useless) plan that wouldn't have worked anyway because she was effingmarriedfor most of that! (Oh, and, additionally, you canNOT tell me that Troy remained 100% faithful to his crush on Erika in all that time either. If he's a 24 year old healthy male and as hot as the book describes him to be, there's no way he stayed celibate in that all time.)*sighs* Anyway, to move on to Jenna, I basically felt that she didn't get mad enough when she found out about Erika and Troy. I mean, maybe that sounds mean of me since I don't think this is meant to be an angst-filled read, butcome on! You're talking about her SON hooking up with her BEST FRIEND WHO'S ALMOST TWENTY YEARS OLDER THAN SAID SON!!!!!!!!!!!I have a brother who's in his early 20s right now and I can 10000000% guarantee that my mother wouldlose her shit and nearly have a heart attackif he was in that position.So, in other words, though Jenna did get mad, it wasn't madenough, and though she wouldn't have grounds to call protective services or anything since Troy's an adult and all, I was surprised that she didn't put up more of a fight and do much worse to Erika like a restraining order or something. It left me with lukewarm feelings, to be honest.And, finally, there's Clark. *winces* Yeah, he's the villain of the piece since he cheated on Erik and all that, but...I'm sorry, his side plot is just stupid.Oh, not the falling in love with a man part, no. That part I was totally on board with, even while I did think it was stupid for him to say that neither he nor his partner were gay--I mean, having sex between malesiswhat gayis, and she literally caught them in the act, so saying that they don't swing that way is kind of useless; at least admit that you're bi or at least open to being bi, if nothing else.Ahem, but no, the part of the plot that I reallyhatedwas howlater on Clark comes back to Erika looking for comfort, because for some reason his partner's wife was able to look past his cheating on her, and said-partner decided to go back to his wife and leave Clark in the lurch for no reason. There were just so many questions I had to call out on this bullshit, not the least of which would've been what the whole point of the affair was if neither man was serious about it. Like, I get it, affairs don't have to be serious, but since Clark kept insisting on how he and his partner "were in love", it would've made more sense for them to just end up together. I'm not saying that Clark deserves a happy ending, but I felt that the author's "punishment" of him by having him end up alone was just stupidly done. Could've been an easy fix if she just had Clark's partner move on to another man/woman instead of having his wife take him back. And not to mention that Clark coming back to Erika for comfort about it was a pretty douche move as well___________________________________All in all, my complaining aside, those were the two major reasons that I took two stars off for this rating. I also took some points off because the sex scenes, while supposed to be "steamy" were pretty much just average. I mean, I've read way hotter stuff before is all. In fact, for me, the hottest scene was at the beginning when neither Erika nor Troy are even touching each other, as that held a lot more of the "forbidden" aspect of their romance than when they just fling all else to hell and have at each other like bunnies. "Forbidden" should contain more of the whole "don't touch" aspect than it did, if you ask me.Anyway, all in all, the overall rating still rates up to 3 stars, giving this a decentaveragerating. It failed to impress me, but it's also a hard trope to master, so I give the author credit for trying.I'll be giving some other of Nikki Sloane's works a try, more specificallyThe Doctor, since I've read reviews that say it's similar toBirthday Girl, which I loved. The older man/younger woman trope may be WAY more common in romance books, but it still never fails to draw me in, so I'll definitely be giving it a try.
