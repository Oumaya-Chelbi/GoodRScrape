4.25 ‚≠êÔ∏è This book was a riot that I couldn't put down!We're not normal people. We are monsters. But if we're monsters, we'll thrive in the dark. Together.Summary:Sloane and Rowan are great at what they do - murdering serial killers. When a chance encounter sparks an unlikely bond between these two, they decide to have a friendly competition. Each year, they'll meet up to hunt for the most dangerous monsters in the country. Winner gets the kill. Year after year they meet up for this game, but as their friendship develops into something more, the restless ghosts left in their wake are only a few steps behind, ready to claim more than just their newfound love. Can Rowan and Sloane dig themselves out of a game of graves? Or have they finally met their match?WHAT TO EXPECT:‚ú® dark rom-com‚ú® serial killer MCs‚ú® a gruesome meet cute‚ú® annual ‚Äòhunting‚Äô game‚ú® friends to lovers‚ú® he falls first and hard‚ú® witty banter‚ú® nursing back to health scene ü´∂‚ú® 4/5 üå∂Ô∏è (praise, cock warming, rough sex, choking, spitting, dom/sub, genital piercings)‚ú® HEA‚ú® dual POV‚ú® TW: murder, gore, cannibalism, child sexual assault (past), parental loss (not depicted), parental neglect and abuse (past). Check the author's TW before reading.My Thoughts:This was a delight - a weird, fucked up delight. üòÇ It's a very original story, and regardless of all the trigger warnings above, it‚Äôs actually incredibly fun and comical. I don‚Äôt know how the author managed to write a gore filled rom-com about serial killers but she KILLED IT! (pun intended)*I‚Äôve also listened to the audiobook and OMG is it amazing!!! The narrators do an incredible job!*Update:Due to the serious allegations against Joe Arden (who voices the male narrator), Brynn Weave no longer supports/promotes the audiobook, nor do I. So instead, please support Brynn byreadingthe book.I absolutely adored the MCs: Sloane and Rowan.These two are such interesting characters with some obvious trauma that's led them to become killers, but what I love most is that they see each other for exactly who they are and instead of being afraid or wanting the other to change, they embrace all of it and love those parts. They honestly make such a cute couple and hey, I condone their killings since they only target terrible serial killers. It's not like they're hurting innocents.Also, the fact Rowan has a table permanently reserved for Sloane at his restaurant after meeting her one time melted my heart! Talk about obsessed.I adored the found family/family relationships in this story.Sloane has her best friend Lark and Rowan has his two brothers who are fully aware and supportive of their killing hobby. I totally didn't expect this and found it very endearing. There's something special about relationships where they see all of you, the good and the bad, and they love you regardless.The smut SLAYED!Not only are there a lot of spicy scenes but they were filthy and kinky. Rowan is very dominating in bed and takes just as much as he gives. I also think it's badass that Sloane has üê± piercings.I saw the twist coming but it was still entertaining.I buddy read this with a friend who didn't see the twists, so it may not be that obvious. But I promise you, regardless of if you catch it or not, you'll love the end. It's riveting and will have you at the edge of your seat!There were only two things I didn't like:1. I wish we got a bit more background into Sloane's past besides vague mentions of what happened to fuck her up. We can gather there was SA at the boarding school she went to with Lark, but I wasn't 100% sure, so I thought there needed to be a bit more specifics and insight into Sloane's feelings about everything that happened (including killing the teacher).2. Sloane repeatedly says "you're the worst" to Rowan and it becomes a sort of catch phrase, which would have been fine if she didn't say it around 10 times throughout the story. Definitely overkill.Overall, this was an entertaining book and I'd 100% recommend it if you can handle the trigger warnings. It's similar to the Mindf*ck series by S.T. Abby because of the whole female serial killer but it has a much lighter tone and a lot more laughs. I have no idea what's in store for Lark and Fionn in book 2 but I cannot wait to find out!Favorite Quotes:"I didn't gouge them out, Butcher. I plucked them. Delicately. Like a lady."_______"You know what they say, Blackbird. 'It's all fun and games until someone loses and eye.' And that's where the real fun begins."_______‚ÄúThat woman you were watching‚Ä¶?‚Äù My fingers tighten around his throat as he desperately nods. ‚ÄúShe is mine.‚Äù I‚Äôm sure he begs. But I don‚Äôt hear his pleas. They‚Äôre fucking useless words that won‚Äôt save him now._______I refuse to lose her. Sloane is the only person in the world who can look at my monster and find a friend. And I know she needs a friend just as much as I do. Maybe more._______He knows my darkest secrets. I know his. We can be monsters, and maybe we don‚Äôt deserve the same things that other people do. Happiness. Affection. Love. But I can‚Äôt seem to stop the way I feel when I look at every facet of Rowan, from his brightest light to his deepest, most dangerous dark. Maybe I don‚Äôt deserve it for the things I‚Äôve done. But I want it. I want more with him than what I‚Äôve got._______Sloane bleeds into every thought. When we're apart, her absence is an entity. I worry for her. I dream of her. And yesterday, I almost lost her. Killing bounds us together, and it's a compulsion neither of us can live without. This need, and now this game between us, consumes me as much as she does._______Every time I think of her, my heart reminds me I'm not as dead on the inside as I thought after all._______"You're all the best things to me, Sloane. No matter how many bruises are in your heart or on your skin."_______"How do you still have the energy to take the piss out of me?""I always have the energy for that. Your suffering is my number one priority."_______"Before you came along, something was missing. You, Rowan. You were missing. You made it safe to feel seen. Safe to play on our terms. Safe to have fun, even though our fun might not be everyone's idea of a good time."_______‚ÄúPick a safe word. Do it now.‚ÄùI swallow. Hard. ‚ÄúChainsaw.‚ÄùHe huffs a laugh, a burst of warmth against my core.‚ÄúHow fitting, love. Now be a good girl and find something to grab on to‚Ä¶‚Äù he says, then passes one long, slow lick over my center. ‚Äú...Because I‚Äôm about to destroy you.‚Äù_______I told her I'm no angel. I don't think she believed me. But she's about to discover that I'm the devil she never knew she needed._______She's everywhere, in every drop of my blood, in every spark of thought, and I want to fucking destroy her for it. To shatter her just like she's broken me. Because she brings me to my fucking knees. I want to ruin her so that she's mine, my beautiful disaster. My wild creature. My goddess of chaos._______"I would kill for you, and I have. I would do it again, every damn day. I'd turn myself inside out for you. I would die for you. I don't just like you, Sloane, and you fucking know it."_______I know I'm not a normal person, but I don't feel like a monster. I feel like a weapon. The final justice on behalf of those who can't speak, delivering punishment for those who don't deserve clemency._______"You have never been unlovable. You were just waiting for someone who will love you for who you are, not for who they want you to be. I can do that, if you let me."_______"You might be a psycho, but you're my psycho, and I'm yours. Got it?"_______
