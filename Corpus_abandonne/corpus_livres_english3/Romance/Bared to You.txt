WARNING : THIS IS NOT A REVIEWTHIS IS A THIRST TRAPGrab YOUR water bottles girlsI'll be flashing y'all a spciemanAlso keep that in mind It's not a review with spoilers it is spoiler with review 😂First of all I almost didn’t want to write a review on this bookWhy?Because Gideon feels too personal , too mine, my possession and I feel too much territorial about him.Too much raw and real to share him with the rest of the world 😢I know how insane this sounds but it is what it is, in romance community we DON'T judge right ? 😍 Love is suppose to be free and infinitive, little wild and insane.So I am not gonna write anymore proper review on the rest of the books of#Crossfireseries .Simply because I Don't have the balls to do that. I've used every bit of my Testosterone here 😷🤒 and Estrogen ain't allowing me any further to share her man (yes dramatic much?)Anywayyyyyyyy..........I've written little bit when I've read it for the first time and I am not editing that.Apart from Gideon there are two other fictional characters (male protagonist) I feel this way.So I'll try my level best 😍 with this one.Pardon on my mistakes if I get too crazy 😂The Review (MY LOVE LETTER)First Read :3 Stars🌟🌟🌟Second Re-Read :4 Stars🌟🌟🌟🌟Third Re-Read :5 Stars 🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠MY PERCEPTION ON FICTIONAL CHARACTERS:So whenever I read a book in my head my fictional characters don't have faces. They come in colour, shape and very very very distinct characteristics. In my head I can hear their voices. So in my reviews I Don't like to add any face.But when I readBared to YouI found that Male protagonist's description was totally similar toHenry CavillI was kinda confusedThen I saw I am not the only one. Author also follows Cavill on IG. So I'll just use his pictures 🖤Gideon Cross"Damn	it.	My	eyes	closed.	Gideon	Cross.	I	thought	the	name	suited	him.	Itwas	as	sexy	and	elegantly	masculine	as	the	man	himself."So I when I first read his name I googled it "How to pronounce Gideon"his name has sort of a force and a vibe that suggestshe is themajestyNothing more nothing lessHe is born to rule"I	had	never	seen	hair	that	purely	black.	It	was	glossy and	slightly	long,	the	ends	drifting	over	his	collar.	That	sexy	length	was	the crowning	touch	of	bad-boy	allure	over	the	successful	businessman,	like whipped	cream	topping	on	a	hot-fudge	brownie	sundae."The especially about the whole crossfire series is how the author describes the charactersI've never read fictional character's description this phenomenal"I	caught	a	glimpse	of	his	wrist	at	the	end of	his	cuff	and	for	some	crazy	reason	the	sight	of	that	small	expanse	of	golden skin	with	its	light	dusting	of	dark	hair	arrested	my	attention.	He	was	just	so...............…male.""I	was	hyperaware	of	Cross walking	beside	me.	The	way	he	moved,	with	animal	grace	and	arrogant economy,	was	a	major	turn-on."As Eva says he has Animal GraceI think him like aWerewolfPrime AlphaLike aLionAlways Ready pounce his PreyI think he radiates powerHis each move screams dominanceHe just stands out."A	ghost	of	a	smile	touched	his	lips	and	made	him	impossibly	more handsome.	Dear	God.......…"His smile is arrogant and cockyBut Gideon has this special secret smile that is just reserved for Eva."The	man	had	talented	hands,	confident and	skilled,	and	he	took	what	he	wanted	with	them""I	loved	the	way	he	kissed	me,	as	if	he had	to,	as	if	he’d	go	crazy	if	he	didn’t	and	had	nearly	waited	too	long."Eva dear how you Don't pass out on him? 😶 I would have had a heart attack even if he just breaths in my direction........."My	thumb	brushed	over	what	I	assumed	was	his	handwriting.	It	was bold	and	masculine	and	sexy"."ll	be	clear	and	say	there	won’t	be	any other	men	for	you,	Eva.” A	shiver	moved	through	me	at	the	blunt	finality	in	his	tone	and	the	iciness of	his	gaze."Gideon,	who	was	running	with	the	fluidity	of	a	well-oiled	machine""There	wasn’t	an	ounce	of	excess	flesh	on	him anywhere,	just	hard	slabs	of	honed	muscle.	He	had	washboard	abs	and	that super	sexy	V	of	muscle	on	his	pelvis	that	Cary	called	the	Loin	of	Apollo.Gideon	didn’t	wax	his	chest	like	Cary	did,	but	he	groomed	with	the	same	care he	showed	to	the	rest	of	his	body.	He	was	pure	primal	male,	the	embodiment of	everything	I	coveted,	fantasized	about,	and	wished	for.""His	features	were	harsh with	lust,	his	skin	stretched	tight	over	his	cheekbones	and	jaw.	His	eyes	were so	dark	and	dilated	they	were	black,	and	I	knew	I	was	staring	into	the	face	of a	man	who’d	passed	the	limits	of	his	control."."Shh,	angel	…	I’ll	take	care	of	you."“You	forget who submits,	Eva,”	he	said	gruffly.“I’ve	given	up	control	for you.	I’ve	bent	and	adjusted	for	you.	I’ll	do	anything	to	keep	you	and	make you	happy.	But	I	won’t	be	tamed	or	topped.	Don’t	mistake	indulgence	for weakness.”“You’re	a	machine,”	I	told	him.	“Or	a	god.”“It’s you.”“I’ll	make	us	coffee,	while	you	get dressed.”He	finished	his	coffee	and	I	held	out	my	hand	for	his	mug,	but	he	bypassed me	and	rinsed	it	out	himself.	Another	mortal	task	that	made	him	seem accessible,	less	of	a	fantasy	I’d	never	have	a	chance	of	holding	on	to."I’ll	always	take	care	of	you,	Eva.	I live	for	it.”Eva Cross“Hmm?”	He	kissed	the	end	of	my	nose	and	ran	his	hands	down	my	arms.“I’m	not	the	type	you	usually	go	for,	am	I?” His	brow	arched.“I	have	one	type:	Eva	Lauren	Tramell.	That’s	it.”I Can Proudly Say It Out Loud ThatIIDOLIZEEVAMy love and respect for her grew more and more throughout the whole seriesFirst of all🌟Eva is absolutely confident and elegant.🌟She is really really smart and sharp🌟She is independent, doesn’t need Gideon's money🌟She is well mannered, yet when necessary she can be rebel and defiant🌟 Just like Gideon she is gorgeous and can get any man she wants🌟She has backbone and she is one of the most strongest Female leads out there🌟She can't be tamed🌟She loves Gideon more than breathing🌟She is Fierce🌟She can keep Gideon on his toes and when it is necessary she can bring him to his kneesAnd that's really not it there are sooooooo many other qualities she possesses. I just love,respect Eva to the moon and back. I feel a deep gratitude towards her 💕💕💕💕💕note: I have to point it out one year ago when I discovered this series she definitely motivated me to take working out seriously because of her kickboxing and strength training are my two most favourite workouts.I love how she eats well and takes good care of her body 🖤💕Gideon	pressed	his	lips	to	my	temple	and	murmured,“Stay.”“Yes.” He	hugged	me.“You’re	so	brave,	Eva.	So	strong	and	honest.	You’re	a miracle.	My	miracle.”In short they are equalsAND EVA IS MY MOST FAVOURITE FICTIONAL HEROINE"Oh,	Eva.”He	rubbed	his	cheek	against	my	damp	face.“I	must’ve	wished for	you	so	hard	and	so	often	you	had	no	choice	but	to	come true”.“You’re	definitely	trying	to	kill	me.	Are	you	wearing	the	garters	again?” Pulling	the	hem	of	my	skirt	up,	I	showed	him	where	the	top	of	my	black silk	stockings	hooked	to	my	black	lace	garter	belt.His	muttered	curse	made	me	smile.“Oh,	boy.”	My	nose	wrinkled.“Hello,	Mr.	Comfortable.	I’m	Miss Complicated.” His	grin	flashed.“Never	a	dull	moment.”"Don’t	ever	apologize	for	being	yourself	with	me.It’s	what	I	want.	I	want	to	be	your	safe	place,	Gideon"P.S - If I have to give Eva a face then she is definitelyScarlett Johansson❤#Gideva"You	have	to	meet	me	halfway."I think they are the most perfect couple I have ever come acrossIt is them Vs the world conceptThey fight for each other and together ❤Both of them are vulnerable and brokenYet they are always each other. They will jump in the fire for each other.No one can separate them.They are just made for each other."I’ve	never	wanted anything	this	badly.”Their connection	is startlingly	intense, 	Emotionally, Mentally they Possesse each other."I	need	to	hang	on	to	you	for	a	while.”“I	need	to	be	held.”"He	looks	at	you	like	you’re	the	only	person	in	the	room."“Excuse	me,”	I	said	from	the	threshold	of	the	room.	“I’m	looking	for Gideon	Cross,	the	man	who	doesn’t	have	romance	in	his	repertoire.” He	grinned	sheepishly,	a	boyish	smile	so	at	odds	with	the	mature	sexuality of	his	bared	body.	“I	don’t	think	about	it	that	way.	I	just	try	to	guess	what might	please	you,	and	then	I	give	it	a	shot	and	hope	for	the	best.”“I’ve	always	seen	you,	angel.	From	the	moment	you	found	me,	I’ve seen	nothing	but	you.“Make	love	to	me,”	he	begged	in	a	breathless	whisper.“Make	love	with me.	Touch	me,	angel.	Put	your	hands	on	me.”Tears	coursed	down	my	temples.“I	love	you,	Gideon.”“Please	…”	His	eyes	squeezed	shut.“I	love	you.”I	straightened	and	Gideon	sat	up	and	wrapped	himself	around	me.	He	took me	back	down	to	the	floor,	where	he	buried	his	face	in	my	throat	and	cried until	dawn"When a man shed tears just from the thought of losing his girl (and he hadn’t even done anything wrong) especially someone so Rough, tough and in control like Gideon.I swear I DON'T think there is anything more beautiful than this. It is just the most emotionally intimate thing."I	want	you	here.”“I	want	to	be	here.”	He	paused	beside	me.“Can	I	hold	you?” I	turned	into	him	and	squeezed	him	hard.	“Please.”“I	am	home.”	He	caught	me	from	behind	and	buried	his	face	in	my	soaked hair.“I’m	with	you.”Thank u ❤ for reading my review.As I mentioned it is hard to put my feelings out there for Gideon.It took me quite a lot of time to finish writing it andAfter writing it and reading all these quotes againI feel emotionally drained#Gideva's story means so much to meIt is just super close to my heartI Hate to say Goodbye to them..............Happy Reading xoxo 🌹🌹🌹
