I don’t know. This just wasn’t as engaging as I thought it could have been. Each “personality” has key traits, a handful of real-life examples, pros and cons to that personality, how to handle it and what to do if that IS your personality. The bulk of it repeats, though: be compassionate and not judgmental, remember it’s only one part of who [you] are, various spins on “set your boundaries firmly but kindly”.For the most part, I think the people that go seeking and reading this kind of book are those who are familiar with the “tactics” that this book suggests. They’re certainly valid; the book simply doesn’t explore things in as much depth as it could. The two that I needed help with - Passive-Aggressive and Highly Sensitive - were featured, but I didn’t find any new groundbreaking concept. There were better and longer articles from google.I found the most useful parts to be the examples. “Passive aggressive” is practically a trendy insult, but do you recognize it when someone agrees to help and then drags their feet to never complete a project? My offender’s style is more “it’s fine but I’m going to sulk openly and give the silent treatment”, but then I recognized the former as a behavior that I’ve seen as well. So, that was a little novel.My LEAST favorite part was when the book started listing out traits of various personality disorders and citing the DSM-IV. Whoa whoa. Stay in your lane. You write a book that only includes SOME of the criteria for diagnosis for the general public? It doesn’t mention the other criteria; it simply sticks to what traits Obsessive Compulsive PD may look like. That isn’t helpful, though, because there’s a lot of other fine print that goes along with that diagnosis.Overall, it was a little disappointing, dry, and dated, but could be good for thumbing through.
