4 stars😈thank youneelafor being the only reason i continued this series after book 1 because this is by far the best book of the series.tropes:↬ BDSM↬ hotwifing↬ polyamory↬ unrequited love↬ MF/MM/MFM/MMF↬ best friends to lovers/husbands best friendwatch me occasionally pretend to care for anything besides the smuthunter (H)anddrake (H)have known each other since they were kids. both were born on the wrong side of the tracks with hunter’s dad being an abusive alcoholic and drake having to witness his mom mess around with unsavory men. when hunter's dad was on a tirade, he would often go to drake’s house and sleep in his basement.isabel (h)is a good girl and a bookworm that was only 17 when she first met hunter and drake. hunter and isabel’s relationship was so cute because hunter told her, the moment he first spoke to her, that she was his future wife—“I’m gonna save you in here as Red, but can I have your actual name?”“Isabel.”“Isabel…” he says, trying it out on his tongue.“And yours?” I ask.“Hunter, your future boyfriend. No…your future husband.”the way he wanted to be better for her so we quit being a drug dealing, bad boy and got an apartment and a real job 😭🫶🏻now, over a decade later, hunter and isabel are married and drake is basically their third wheel. poor guy. hunter is the part-owner of a sex club calledsalaciousand drake is a contractor they use. the book starts off with hunter, drake and isabel on a road trip to look at sex clubs around the country, for ideas on how to improve their own sex club.while at a sex club in phoenix, drake and isabel are mistaken as a couple and pulled on stage for a shibari demonstrationin this case, shibari involves using rope to restrain someone, often times for moreleverageduring sex. while drake was tying up isabel and performing the demonstration for the crowd, hunter ends up walking in and seeing them—My mouth goes dry. Because somewhere in the room, I feel Hunter’s eyes watching us. I scan the room again, but I don’t see him. I feel him, though. He’s out there. He can see me exposed and tied up with his best friend, and my heart pounds wildly in my chest at the thought.it was so funny watching them get all nervous and hunter was sat there getting a hard on BAHHAHplease, when the shibari instructor asks drake to hold onto the ropes and thrust against her while she was bent over 😮‍💨after witnessing that, hunter realizes that he has a hotwife kink. hotwifing is when a married woman has sexual relations with another man or men, often times with their significant other watching.hunter proposes the idea of him watching drake and isabel have sex, which they both refuse. he dropped the subject because he’s a cutie and promised to never live out his fantasy...until they realize they want to do it. poor hunter thought he ruined everything LOLand y’all THIS SHIT GETS SO FUCKING HOT🫦🫦“Your girl has a dirty fucking mouth.”“Yes, she does. Fucking filthy,” I reply.She squirms some more, as if she’s trying to find his dick.“I mean, look at her,” Drake says, teasing her with his hands around her backside. “Cuffed to this bench like a little slut, begging for dick.”the degrading by calling her 'little slut’🤌🏻🥵let me not forget the scene where drake wants to include hunter in the sharing, so he puts isabel on hunter’s lap. while drake is fucking isabel, his eyes meet Hunter’s over her shoulder—...but where do my eyes wander? Straight to Hunter’s face. Probably because he’s watching me. And as I thrust between his legs, brushing up against his thighs, I realize how much it looks and feels as if I’m fuckinghim.hunter has always felt some attraction towards drake, but he’s always denied it because of how traumatic his childhood was and the mentality his dad had. drake on the other hand (who is bisexual), has been in love with hunter for a long time, as long as he can rememberthe first time we actually notice tension between hunter and drake was in book 2 when drake mentions not having an issue fucking another man. hunter gets pissed off by it. drake always thought it was some sort of prejudice that hunter had but it wasn’t…he was jealous of how comfortable drake was with his sexuality and well...the idea of him fucking a man other than him BAHAH. but huntie didn’t realize that yet 💗after denying his attraction for drake for years,hunter lets his jealousy get the better of himbecause what better way is there to realize you want someone.while at another sex club, drake enters a dark room. which is a completely pitch black room where people can have sex with anyone without seeing them. when hunter enters the room (with high vision googles) he sees drake getting hit on by another manand boyyyy does hunter get jealous—I still can’t see him or anything, but there’s no time to try because his mouth is suddenly on mine. With one hand firmly around the back of my neck, he kisses me hard.[…]“Mine,”he mutters darkly, and my cock stirs in response.the situation actually made me sad afterwards because after drake gives hunter a blowjob, he leaves him on the floor. the whole situation felt horrible and degrading for drake. this was my brain for the majority of the book watching hunter want drake and proceed to leave him after any sort of physical connectiondrake feels like it’s always him sacrificing something, whether it’s his time or him being forced to watch two people he loves, be happy together—“I’m coming,” I reply,following closely behind him. Because that’s what I do.That’s what I always do.one night, isabel wakes up to hear drake and hunter making out in the hallway. she hears hunter tell drake to go into the bedroom andprephimself. hunter walks into isabel’s room, where she tries to fake sleep because she wants them to have this moment for themselvesreading the scene where hunter fucks drake for the first time from the perspective of isabel was SO GOOD. also the way she was getting off on it BAHAHAH girl I don’t blame you—The bed creaks, the headboard slamming into the wall as Hunter fucks him with fire and passion now, thrusting to a heavy beat. And if they thought I was going to sleep through this, they are crazy.the way she was trying to keep quiet because she didn’t wanna interrupt.it’s okay girl, hunter already knew you were watching😌this is only afractionof the sex scenes y’allas you can see, this book is hot AS HELL. the romance between drake and hunter was far superior than their’s with isabel.half the time i was like…isabel?¿ haven’t heard of her👩‍🦯drake made me wanna cry so many times because he was always so fucking in love with hunter and couldn’t act on it for so damn long UGH—“I guess while you were his whole world…he was mine.”hunter’s character development was perfect omg i adored watching him accept who he really was 🥺honorable mention:this sweet moment, during the short flashback scene that i mentioned before, when hunter and isabel first met—“No, I don’t come here often, but now I’m thinking I should.”“To pick up girls?” I reply, trying not to blush.“To talk to you.”also, yes, this can be read as a standalone ✨salacious players club↠ #1praise—1.75 stars↠ #2eyes on me—2.99 stars↠ #3 give me more —4 stars↠ #4mercy—3.75 stars
