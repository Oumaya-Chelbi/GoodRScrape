“Partake of every simple pleasureFor living is the finest treasure.”-the Gnome King’s treasure songI purchased this beautiful collection of illustrations and stories from Folio Society because Charles van Sandwyk is one of, if not my favorite illustrator.The collection contains the following stories:How to see Fairies 1993Wee Folk 1994Pocket Guide to the Little People 1997The Gnome Kong’s Treasure Song 2000The Fairies Christmas 2001Afterglow 2008The Fairy Market 2009The Folio Society’s collection comes in a gorgeous red protective slipcase with more of van Sandwyk’s illustrations repeated in gold on the outside. The book itself was bound and printed in Italy with beautiful high quality Italian paper that does credit to van Sandwyk’s beautiful illustrations.This is a beautiful collection and is almost as special to me as one of his hand-bound stories straight from van Sandwyk’s own studio.The stories are sweet and magical, but not as magical as the illustrations...his portrayal of nature and all of its beautiful little details is second to none. Somehow just knowing there is an illustrator or rather an artist like Charles van Sandwyk, makes me feel just a little bit better about the world we live in.“For Love is in those scattered seeds...And flowers live amongst the weeds.”
