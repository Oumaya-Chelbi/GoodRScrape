A book that is epic in both scope and narrative - but for me a book where the payoff of the destination, was not quite worth the effort of the journey....Final Rating: 3.6/5🌕🌕🌕🌗🌑I wanted to love this, but overall it was a step down for me from The Gardens of the Moon. While they were both equally complex, I felt that there just wasn't as much of an epic ending in this book as there was in the first. Indeed, when people speak of the "epic ending" in this book I'm still not actually sure which part or storyline they're referring to. Which is never a good sign. That said, I'm still very keen to continue with the series and am just hoping that the next book in the series finally "clicks" for me :)ColtainePlot Summary"Deadhouse Gates", the second book in the Malazan Book of the Fallen series, shifts the action to the continent of Seven Cities, on the brink of a holy rebellion known as the Whirlwind. The plot follows multiple characters, such as Felisin, a young noblewoman sold into slavery, and Kalam, an assassin with plans to kill the Empress. Among the most memorable plotlines is the journey of Coltaine, a Malazan commander guiding a host of refugees through hostile desert lands. The narrative balances numerous threads, diving deep into the rich history, culture, and magic of the Malazan world, culminating in a complex tale of survival and sacrifice.““Children are dying."Lull nodded. "That's a succinct summary of humankind, I'd say. Who needs tomes and volumes of history? Children are dying. The injustices of the world hide in those three words.””Storyline: 2.5/5When it comes to narrative, "Deadhouse Gates" is no doubt an epic. Erikson spins a yarn filled with countless characters, vast landscapes, and intertwining plotlines. Each storyline carries its own weight, and when they converge, the result can be pretty awe-inspiring. The Chain of Dogs plotline, for instance, is an emotional rollercoaster, a tale of courage and sacrifice that stands out amidst the narrative tapestry.However, in this instance I found that the complexity of the narrative was a bit too much to handle. There are so many (new) characters and plots to follow that it feels like you're navigating a maze without a map. Erikson certainly doesn't coddle his readers; he expects you to piece it all together yourself. While some might appreciate this approach, I found it a bit overwhelming (even with the help of a readers guide). It often felt more like work than enjoyment to keep up with all the details and connect the dots.I normally don't mind work in a fantasy book, indeed I kind of expect it as you get the world built out before you, so that it all culminates is some epic payoff. Seeing all those scattered puzzle pieces finally come together, witnessing the evolution of characters, and experiencing the climax of each storyline can be satisfying. But, at least for me, this book got that calculation off by a wide margin. The effort required to reach that payoff was just a too steep. And the narrative while there is certainly a narrative payoff, no doubt, the reward didn't make up for the complexity of the climb. I remember saying to myself through the first 600 pages, it'll be worth it in the end just keep going. Then in the final 200 I kept asking, when is the payoff going to get here? Then in the last 50, I realised that the small narrative climax I'd just passed was not a false peak, it was the actual peak ("Was that the AMAZING ending people that people kept telling me about?"). So in terms of scope, it's a narrative marvel for sure, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that a more accessible path to the payoff (or a epic ending similar to Gardens of the Moon) would have made the experience more enjoyable.“The lesson of history is that no one learns.”Characterisation: 3.5/5I'm in two minds about characterisation in this book. The first part of me thinks that the characters in "Deadhouse Gates" are really out of this world in terms of how they're written - although many of them are very unlikeable. The second part of me though really disliked how we didn't get to follow on with the stories of characters from the first book, because Erikson decided to start a whole new slate of story lines. I think I get why he did it (and that he'll continue to do it throughout this series), but chopping and changing like that really isn't my cup of tea.If I just look at the characters in "Deadhouse Gates" though, they truly are something else. Erikson rolls out a whole new cast, each with their own unique backstory and motivations. You've got characters like Fiddler, whose quiet determination just grabs you, and Felisin, whose heartbreaking transformation hits you right in the feels. Then there's my favorite, Kalam - he's this enigmatic, deadly assassin but with such a depth of character, he feels real. He's got this tough exterior, but underneath, there's a sense of loyalty and a quest for justice that makes you root for him. Even characters like Coltaine, who could've been just another tough, distant military guy, are way more layered and interesting than you'd expect. Erikson's characters might not all be likable, but wow, do they pull you into their stories. They bring this epic tale down to earth, making it personal. So, they're not just characters in a fantasy book; they feel like real people trying to make it through a seriously brutal world.Kalam Mekhar“What makes a Malazan soldier so dangerous? They’re allowed to think”Writing Style: 4/5Erikson's prose continues to be a standout. It's dense, lyrical, and often philosophical, offering profound insights into the nature of power, war, and human nature. His world-building is second to none, effortlessly combining elements of fantasy, history, and anthropology to create a unique and immersive universe.Despite these strengths, the pacing can be uneven. Some storylines move at a brisk pace, while others seem to drag. The book also tends to lean heavily into grimdark territory, which may not be to everyone's taste. While I personally don't mind it, I'm sure some readers would also find the relentless brutality and cynicism exhausting - it certainly feels like the narrative is wallowing in its own misery sometimes.“We are all lone souls. It pays to know humility, lest the delusion of control, of mastery, overwhelms. And, indeed, we seem a species prone to that delusion, again and ever again.”World Building: 5/5Now, let's talk about the world-building in "Deadhouse Gates". Man, is it something to behold. Erikson doesn't just create a world; he constructs an entire universe, overflowing with rich history, diverse cultures, and mystical elements that blow your mind. This book whisks us away from the familiar setting of the first installment and drops us onto a whole new continent with its own unique problems and tensions. It's like stepping into a whole new world within an already massive one. The attention to detail is crazy—you've got distinct societies, religions, even different systems of magic. But what really gets me is how Erikson weaves all these intricate details together to create a world that feels alive, chaotic, and just as messed up as our own.“It is one thing to lead by example with half a dozen soldiers at your back. It is wholly another with ten thousand.”Enjoyment: 3/5There's no denying that it's an impressive book. Erikson's creativity and the sheer magnitude of his world-building had me marveling at the page. Characters like Kalam, who became my favorite, and the memorable Chain of Dogs storyline, added an engaging depth to the narrative. It's a rollercoaster of a read with moments of genuine awe and heartache. But, it's also a tricky beast. The complexity, while impressive, often felt overwhelming, pulling me out of the story just when I was starting to get into it. I found myself working harder than I'd have liked to keep track of everything. So while there were parts I really enjoyed, the effort required to fully appreciate this intricate tapestry took a toll on my overall enjoyment. It's a book that's rewarding to those willing to commit, but be prepared for the hefty challenge it presents. All said, "Deadhouse Gates" is an intriguing but demanding read that delivers a satisfying payoff, even if getting there can be a bit of a slog.I'll definitely continue with the series, but I'm hoping that the next book (which appears to be the highest rated book of the series) will at least continue with one of the existing storylines and not jump to some different third continent.Final Rating: 3.6/5🌕🌕🌕🌕🌗My favourite books of 2023 in preferential order🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕:1.The Shadow of the Gods-(My Review)2.The Grace of Kings-(My Review)3.The Lies of Locke Lamora4.The Forgetting Moon-(My Review)5.The Justice of Kings-(My Review)6.Kings of the Wyld-(My Review)🌕🌕🌕🌕🌗:7.Morning Star-(My Review)8.The Blade Itself-(My Review)9.Red Seas Under Red Skies-(My Review)10.The Escape Artist: The Man Who Broke Out of Auschwitz to Warn the World11.Empire of the Vampire-(My Review)12.Assassin's Apprentice-(My Review)13.Golden Son🌕🌕🌕🌕🌑:14.Leviathan Wakes-(My Review)15.The Winter King-(My Review)16.Gardens of the Moon-(My Review)🌕🌕🌕🌗🌑:17.Deadhouse Gates-(My Review)🌕🌕🌕🌑🌑:18.The Song of Achilles-(My Review)19.Red Sister-(My Review)🌕🌕🌑🌑🌑:20.Babel: An Arcane History-(My Review)
