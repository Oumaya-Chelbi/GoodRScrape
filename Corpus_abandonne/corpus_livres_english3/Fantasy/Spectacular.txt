⊹ 🧣 ˖ ۫ ⤿3 starsheaven is a place on earth with youtell me all the things you wanna do⟢ video games, lana del reyi was elated to find out that we were getting another book in the caraval universe! and that too reading this magical novella right when the festive cheer was starting to kick in was absolutely perfect. it started off with the characters preparing for the great holiday. seeing all of them together and being happy was delightful 🥹 the setting, the descriptions and all the beautiful decorations were all so appealing and i was hooked from the very beginning. stephanie garber's writing never disappoints! i felt like i was actually in valenda with the way she wrote, it made me feel so at home <3 this was in tella's pov and as much as i like her, i really wanted it to be in scarlett's or any other character's pov 😭 i just feel like we got a lot of tella already and i wanted to see more of the others. then things started to get a little strange... the vibes of the book totally shifted and i was surprised. this didnt really seem like the other books in the series and it just felt off. and if you're looking for more scarjulian and evajacks (who were not even mentioned once. sobbing.), then prepare to be utterly disappointed :( the ending was still cute though 💌⟡ ۫◞tellaim honestly not sure how i feel about her... she was never my favorite sister (oop sorry) but then in this book she just seemed kinda worse? i like how she's carefree but sometimes it goes to far and she's just irresponsible which irks me out so bad. she keeps taking bad decisions without having a second thought on how her loved ones would react. okay but i did like how she was so delusional in this book, she got too real there for a second 🤭tella girlie just cant stay out of trouble! like hello you live in a magical world where you know some things are dangerous and she eats candy from a mysterious guy in a mysterious street? yeah real smart. when she got kidnapped and uh her kidnapper started kissing her WHY DID SHE GO ALONG WITH IT.weknew it was legend BUT SHE WASN'T EVEN SURE. she was literally freaking about how maybe it wasnt legend AND SHE STILL KEPT GOING?! i was flabbergasted to say the least. yeah that whole part was so weird.i might have outgrown toys, but i hope never to outgrow joy and dressing up and giving gifts.⟡ ۫◞legendoh him... i didnt really like himthatmuch in the caraval series cause he was just so conflicting at times 😭 honestly i dont get anything from him, i feel like his personality is just being legend and nothing more?? i dont remember much about him from the previous books anyways and i think that says a lot 🥲 i thought he might redeem himself here but that was unfortunately not what happened.. in fact it was quite the opposite... haha! okay but his illustrations were GORGEOUS. the top hat and all !!so can someone explain how he thought it was okay to kidnap the love of her life and make that as a game?? i know tella wrote a letter to him before asking him to do that but why was it so fricking disturbing 😭 so this is considered true love huh! cute!“does this mean you actually love the great holiday after all?” legend’s perfect smile appeared again. “no, donatella. i just love you.”⟡ ۫◞scarlett + julianmy loves!! they both got a whooping two whole moments and that was far better than the whole book combined 🤭 the love i have for them is eternal, they own a permanent place in my heart <3 it was wonderful to see scarlett being all happy cause my girl has went through so much ❤️‍🩹 her being excited for the holidays and planning this great big ball with so much enthusiasm healed me aw! her illustrations were breath taking she's so beautiful!! and julian “you look devastating, crimson.” santos... literally my husband HE WAS SO FINE HERE. i was questioning my sanity when he first appeared. the way he calls her crimson>> that one word can melt me into a puddle. and his illustrations rendered me speechless. how can one man be so perfect?! them being together was the best part of this book for sure, no one else comes close to scarjulian 💗“you look quite dashing, my love.” she pressed a kiss to his cheek as she reached him. but julian turned quickly enough that her lips found his instead. his arm snaked around her waist, holding her tight and kissing her back until her cheeks were redder than a candy cane. “you scoundrel,” she murmured. “it’s not my fault you look so pretty when you blush.”overall this book is definitely for the tellalegend lovers! the fluttery holiday feels this book gave in the beginning was fun while it lasted haha. it wasn't needed in my opinion but i enjoyed it to some extent nonetheless. happy holidays everyone !! ❄️🎄love,ahana ⋆
