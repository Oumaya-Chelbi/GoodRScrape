This book dives right in. We meet our main character Claire, now Emily, who as a young girl is captivated by music videos. Her devotion to them is so deep that eventually, a being from beyond the screen reaches out to her with an offer. She will gain magic and success if she gives up half of herself to live behind the screen.Cut to the present day and she is a music critic and lover who is meeting with others who have also made the deal.She is starting to question the deal she made when her other self reaches through a screen and switches their places. The her that was stuck in TV world is not let loose and the her from our world is now trapped behind the screen.She quickly discovers that she is stuck in A-Ha's Take on Me music video and the guy with the wrench has just showed up.This is a cool little story that has me intrigued after one issue. The art is good throughout and there are some panels that really stand out. I like that it was able to use different art styles as well, while still feeling cohesive.While writing this, I also started seeing this as being commentary on fame and what you have to do to get famous and stay that way.At the end we also get two mini comics.The first is about a man who is able to see the ghost of a lost love when he plays Taylor Swift's "I Wish You Would." He plays it over and over again to wallow in the pain.The second is about a a guy at a concert, thinking critically about the band as the girl next to him is giddy and showing it. So, he spills his drink on her, "on accident."Overall, an interesting book that I am interested to see where it will go in the 2nd issue.
