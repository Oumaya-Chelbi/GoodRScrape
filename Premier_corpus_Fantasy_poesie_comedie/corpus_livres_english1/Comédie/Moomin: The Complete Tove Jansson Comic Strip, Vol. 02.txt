I have bottomless affection for Jansson's Moomin creations. The novels were my favorite reads as a young reader, and Finn Family Moomintroll was read to me multiple times (at my insistence) as a bedtime story. I'm not sure why, but despite Moomintroll having become essentially the Mickey Mouse of Finland and probably that country's most instantly recognizable symbol, I still feel like the Moomin world is this sort of awesome secret place just for me. That probably speaks to the genius of its creator, her ability to create a private, intimate, immersive experience for every reader. I'm sure it also helps that in my mind Moomin = fond childhood memories.It's interesting to me that my two favorite comic strip dailies (this and Pogo by Walt Kelly) were close contemporaries, both reaching their heights in the mid-1950s. There are rather a lot of similarities between the two strips, actually: both revolve around lovingly rendered fantastic/animal characters who live bucolic livestyles in their respective reclusive rural habitats and who on occasion suffer intrusions from the outside world or go on minor adventures. Pogo ultimately became much more involved in topical political statements than Moomin (though I've only read the Moomin strips up through 1954 at this point so that could change I suppose), but Moomin features its moments of social commentary as well (see Moomin Begins a New Life in this volume). I wonder if the pastoral settings evoked in both these works reflects a general frustration with post-World War II modernity? Not sure, and a sample size of n=2 is pretty underrepresentative of the landscape of the comic dailies of the time. I'd be very interested in receiving referrals to works in a similar vein from a concurrent time as these two, though, so if you have them pass them along!
