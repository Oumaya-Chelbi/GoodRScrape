I'm giving this issue a 4.5*s which is a big relief after not really caring for the artwork in the previous issue. The artwork of this one is done by Lotay and she's a fantastic artist. Her style is more rough around the edges than that of Cowes or Brown, but I certainly prefer it to Brown's art style and it's a good back-up for Cowes.The story of this issue was also really good. I liked that we were introduced to a new member of the Gods and her storyline was dark and gritty and heart-wrenching. I felt as though it was not only a sad story, but that the way it played out and unfolded really worked and the balance was pretty spot on with the writing and pacing. Whereas the previous issue had only been a 'filler' one, this one stood out as a great issue in and of itself.The artwork for this issue is very whimsical and beautiful and much softer than the hard lines which Cowes uses and I think that did lose a little of the impact at some small moments but that's a very minor quibble. On the whole I thought Lotay to be a fantastic illustrator who knew how to get the balance right between her own style and also making each character distinctive and recognisable for the reader. I will certainly be checking out some of Lotay's other work soon because this issue made me really want to see more of her :)I would give this a 4.5*s and say it's nearly back to top form. I once again loved the last page of the issue done by Cowes and thought it was awesome. We'll have to see what comes up next I suppose :) 4.5*s
