Music isn’t just important to the characters in Phonogram, it’s who they are. Identity, desires, needs all expressed through bands and songs. This issue goes even further into the conflict between the Pop Kid and the Girl Who’s Just Too Damn Cool For You that are Emily and Clare, the two halves of the central character. Changing taste in music becomes a method of diving into your own past, taking us back to the girl both Emily and Clare once were. You might have had to have given your heart and soul to a band or artist to fully understand what Gillen and McKelvie are doing with both words and artwork but if you do this comic could be your life; uncomfortable in how well it understands you but uplifted that people do understand you and that they get to write a comic like this for you.
