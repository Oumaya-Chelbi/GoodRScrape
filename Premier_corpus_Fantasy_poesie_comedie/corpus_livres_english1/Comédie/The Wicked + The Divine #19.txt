I think everyone will like this arc the best just because it's all action and high stakes (I could feel myself screaming in my head as both sides fought to get Minerva) ---- and even then Gillen still allows the characters to breathe a little. The pantheon is now all out civil war with the Gods divided among the sky gods and the underworld gods. Needless to say, Dionysus, who has always seen Woden for who he truly is, is roped in with the underworld gods. It's a shame that the gods we know and love like Baal and Amaterasu are still Ananke's pawns but I am really loving the underworld gods banding together.Now the worry is if the underworld gods will end up fracturing after the revelation from #18's epilogue...
