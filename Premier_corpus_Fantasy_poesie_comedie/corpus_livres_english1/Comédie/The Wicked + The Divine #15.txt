This was the first guest issue I felt was enhanced by McKelvie’s absence; Stephanie Hans’s style feels reflective of Ameratsu being the lead character in the issue; flowing and natural rather than crisp and dynamic. It’s a continuation getting at the humans at the heart of the gods that’s permeated this arc; Gillen’s replaced a direct human conduit by stripping away the mystique to expose the people behind the mask. Throughout the arc the question has been how human beings (and young human beings at that) handle the power and responsibility of their sudden apotheosis. And for the most part he answer has come back: not very well. We’ve seen misogyny, abuses of power and suicide as a result but this issue’s like the last line on Radiohead’s The Bends; after several symphonies of despair it’s a fragile note of hope. Ameratsu is not a forceful personality, nor interested in being involved with whatever game Ananke is playing but she tries to make the world a better place in her own way. The effect of fame can be beneficial. It’s a lovely small story which is liable to get lost in the stampede to find out what’s really going on.
