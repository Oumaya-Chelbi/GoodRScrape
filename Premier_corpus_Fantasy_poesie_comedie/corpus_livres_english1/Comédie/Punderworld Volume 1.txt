If you've seen those cute comics of Hades and Persephone that sometimes do the rounds online – this is the first collection of those. Yes, the title is terrible, and not even that applicable, because while there is humour here, it's derived far more from character, reaction faces and the odd pratfall than puns. What I hadn't expected, though, was the serious bits. Given the ongoing vogue for retelling classical legends to point up the raw deal women tend to get in the originals, it's fascinating that Linda Sejic has gone the other way, taking one of the stories where the default reading was that the woman was getting a raw deal, and retelling it as a sweet romance. Thus, Persephone here becomes the overworked, shut-away daughter of a controlling mother, never allowed out to other gods' festivals; Hades, meanwhile, is a shy guy admiring her from afar for centuries, never daring to make a move until well-meaning but brash Zeus appoints himself wingman and lends a hand. And yes, all his initial suggestions do run along familiar lines ("So first, you turn into a bee").It's an angle I could easily see pissing off both the doctrinaire, and those who were already personally invested in the usual Wuthering Heights-esque interpretation, but its popularity isn't ever so surprising when it has Sejic's reliably winning art to convince the doubters. From the most relatable human microexpressions to the grand mythic panoplies and shows of force, she makes it all look both beautiful and real – which also enables her to blur the boundaries between those categories yet keep any hint of bathos entirely deliberate, as when the Styx gives a watery thumbs-up and it's funny, yes, but still impressive with it. Really, my only complaint is that like too many Image books it's littered with homophones, duplicate words and typos, and could really have done with an editor to buff these entirely unnecessary imperfections out of a generally lovely read.(Edelweiss ARC)
