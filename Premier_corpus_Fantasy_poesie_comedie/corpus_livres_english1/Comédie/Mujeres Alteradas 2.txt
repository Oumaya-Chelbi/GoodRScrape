6 art panels per page under unifying theme of titlebut only 1.75 x 2.75 inches houses all art and dialogueHer art is good as expressive caricature but it's basic newspaper style simplicity.PERFECT material for a weekly periodical because it makes you think and parry it's philosophy for however long you want to hash it out. If you're social, that is. Sure there are universalities abounding but it's almost completely peopleÂ² fare.She scribes my type of reading so what took so long between the first two when they're sold easy and cheap? My personal application of Effort Committment. Needing to get IN it to enjoy it- really spoon the cheerios out of her viewpoints.Here's the drill to enjoy Maitena- starting over every page laboriously.->On each page enter a mind-frame based on the title.-->Each panel enter a particular mindset of it's main character.--->Your own mindset about each is summoned, you relate, you identify people, you...many other factors automatically.That gets you through a one sixth of every page. The first takes the longest and the rest are effortless but then you must restart. And get "stuck" on certain ones that drive parallel this and that... (I'm done here- spent too much time over too many days to then get deep into this.) and you realize that it needs be spread out to marinate and become succulent instead of truculent.
