Finally!! This issue almost redeemsCommercial Suicidefrom what seemed like a complete fail.Yes it's still a filler but this backstory is engaging and not confusing, unlike the others.5 issues in I finally completely understand the whole guest artist idea because here it 100% works. As already explained the plan of having various illustrators work on this volume was to better portray the single gods portrayed in each issue but in #16 this fully works. Unlike all the others which I didn't like (#15 was ok but not this good) Del Duca's work clicks right when the flashback into the Morrigan's past starts, just like it's supposed to be. The first few pages I wasn't too fond of it but from that point on it just weaved with the storyline perfectly.So thank you for finally giving me a worthy issue when i was just about ready to give up onTheWicTheDiv. I'm still sorry to say that I can't wait for the whole volume to be over, in hope that the next is action packed and as entertaining as the first two.
