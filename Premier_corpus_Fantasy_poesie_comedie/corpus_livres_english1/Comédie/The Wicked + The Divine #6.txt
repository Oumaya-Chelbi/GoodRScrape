If you haven't read issue #1-5 well turn around now because there's spoilers for that but otherwise this is a Spoiler Free review. Everything that is spoiler will be hidden.So, After that banger of ending in the last IssueThings slowed down a little. It's been a while and Laura is traumatized and kind of just going through the motions but then we finally met "INANNA" who is really giving me Prince Purple vibesand then some information is imparted that is bound to stir things up a bit and I'm looking forward to that!Overall I liked this Issue. Images as always are on point. Just waiting for the story to pick up a little but its seems to be chugging along.One Questions that we didn't get answered yet although it was touched upon and explored a little is... Does Laura have powers? I mean "ANANKE" usually visits them before hand and explains everything if their "GODS"and shes already met Laura but could Luci have have passed along some of her power?My thoughts on Issues #1-4:The Wicked & The Divine #1:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...The Wicked & The Divine #2:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...The Wicked & The Divine #3:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...The Wicked & The Divine #4:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...
