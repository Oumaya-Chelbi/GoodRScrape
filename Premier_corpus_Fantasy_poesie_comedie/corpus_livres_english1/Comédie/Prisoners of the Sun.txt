Le Temple du Soleilis the sequel toThe Seven Crystal Balls(which I have unfortunately never managed to fully read) and while it is definitely a tale of both engaging high spirited adventure and often even rather majorly hilarious and funny in scope, especially with regard to Captain Haddock's antics and general attitudes (like the repeated times he gets spit in the face by llamas, for considering that llamas tend to only engage in this type of behaviour when and if they are seriously annoyed or feeling threatened in some way, that little salient factoid clearly and humorously demonstrates that the captain does, indeed, often behave inappropriately and like at best a gambolling and annoying curmudgeon, like a rampaging bull in the proverbial china shop) and that in general,Le Temple du Soleilis also quite a bit less majorly ethnically stereotyping than some of Hergé's earlier Tintin graphic novels (such as for example hisTintin au Congowhich is simply terrible and patently unacceptable in EVERY WAY with regard to its in one's face overt racism), there nevertheless is ONE particular episode inLe Temple du Soleilthat made me massively and lastingly annoyed and angry when I first read the latter as a teenager and yes still majorly frustrates me as an adult rereadingLe Temple du Soleil. For while Hergé portrays the Incas as perhaps dangerously misguided in and with their attempts to safeguard their treasures and culture from outsiders (with violence, subterfuge and for Tintin and Captain Haddock with threatened execution for having found their temple) but generally and appreciatively still rather sympathetically depicted and basically for the most part simply concerned with keeping themselves hidden and their imperilled culture and amassed treasures intact and removed from the world, the author, Hergé also both describes and illustrates the Inca as basically simplistically and strangely superstitious.And this becomes especially apparent and clearly shown when Tintin uses that impending solar eclipse about which he had read in a newspaper to obtain freedom for himself and Captain Haddock. Yes, the Incas did historically worship the sun, and thus also and logically would likely still worship the sun inLe Temple du Soleil(and thus, I guess it might make sense to Hergé to have attempted to depict the Incas as superstitious with regard to the sun and of course also afraid of the darkness that a solar eclipse engenders). However, considering that the Incas are deemed and known to be an ancient and advanced civilisation and that solar eclipses do tend to happen regularly, in my opinion, the Incas ofLe Temple du Soleilas very ancient, long-time sun worshippers would have and should have absolutely been aware of solar eclipses as a recurring phenomenon, thus making the method by which Tintin and Captain Haddock escape at best not only rather (if not actually quite) unbelievable but also and far more seriously, frustratingly paternalistic and borderline racially, culturally insulting if not decidedly bigoted in tone (not to mention the inconvenient truth that Tintin using a solar eclipse to basically shock and awe the Incas into letting him and Captain Haddock go does basically make no historical and factual sense whatsoever, considering how advanced the Incas as a civilisation are supposed to have been with regard to mathematics and astronomy, namely that they would almost certainly have been very much able to accurately predict solar eclipses).And indeed I still vividly remember the first time I readLe Temple du Soleilas a teenager (and in German translation, I should add). I had just finished reading a non fiction account on the Incas and their in many ways so advanced civilisation (for high school social studies) and I was happily reading along and actually quite enjoying myself, but to then encounter how Tintin uses the predicted solar eclipse and the supposed superstitions of his sun worshipping Inca captors to escape execution, that did in fact make me do a major and massive double take (a very much and eye-opening and "oh my gosh" moment for me). And even now, when rereading, I am still really only willing to grant at most a two and a half star ranking to and for Hergé'sLe Temple du Soleil(not a horrible story by any means, and actually very much enjoyable in many ways, but certainly with still way way too much paternalism and attitudes of Euro-centric superiority present for me to consider raising the rating to three stars). And as such recommended only with the caveat that especially the "solar eclipse" episode warrants discussion and debate and should therefore also not just be deemed as simply a necessary plot device ofLe Temple du Soleil, but an inherently problematic authorial attitude that requires at least being pointed out in a critical and very much questioning manner.
