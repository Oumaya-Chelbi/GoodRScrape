I'm a sucker for adaptations of old fairy tales and myths (Grimm, Fable, etc.) So when I heard that Grant Morrison is coming out with a Santa origin story, I just know that I had to find a way to get my hands on it and read it.The story starts with Mr Klaus (he doesn't know that he's Santa yet) visiting a small village in the middle of winter to sell his wolfskin, but he ran into trouble after learning that the Yuletime holiday had just been banned, and adults are sent to work in the mines. What's more, toys are taken away from the children because fun is also restricted.In the first issue, we don't really see a lot of signs of the Santa we know yet, as it focused more on laying the groundwork of the plot. Which I think was good, because it teases you of what's in store in the next issues.What we did get to see was possibly the manifestation of Christmas spirits and the role that they play. I really hope that the next issues will show and describe what was actually going on.Talking about the spirits, I can't forget to mention how great the art was. It was amazing, and really did a good job in making the stories come alive. Just in the first issue alone, there were a lot of amazingly drawn pages.Overall, the first issue was a great start to the origin of Santa. I was really impressed with both the story and artwork, will definitely follow this series closely.
