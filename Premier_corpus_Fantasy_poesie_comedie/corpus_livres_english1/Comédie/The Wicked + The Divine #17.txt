So, this issue was probably the one I was most dubious about when I heard of the guest artist line up and that is because whilst I do really like some of Brandon Graham's work, I definitely didn't think it would work particularly well with this storyline. I still stand by this initial assessment after having read it and I didn't really 'care' about the art, in fact at times I felt it just detracted from a storyline which was actually very good once again. The big problem I have with guest artists is that they add a lot of confusion into the mix and a story which would have flowed well from one part to the next in a volume has been somewhat muddled with the art style ever-changing.With all of that said I have enjoyed hearing the backstories for some of our characters in the last few issues and the story of Sakhmet was highly interesting still. I do think that the writing of this one remained constant and good, but I will be very, very happy when the series relaunches in April with the original team back at the centre of everything :)On the whole, a decent issue but certainly not a standout one. 3*s
