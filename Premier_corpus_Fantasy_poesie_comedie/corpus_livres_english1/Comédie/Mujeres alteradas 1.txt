On Sunday, January 15, 2006 I wrote about this book: (I had received this as a surprise from a book online friend)Well this is the funniest rabck I have ever received.And a total surprise. I love it! Thank you so much morsie.Both women on the cover show typical Marlene moods.:-)So yes very appropriate. :)I could not resist reading the first one, even though I was enjoying the book I was reading but it is really laughing out loud material. Great drawings and you recognize so much in the comics of Maitena.Rowena will enjoy them as well. Thank you. HugsUpdate: Well I read this book in 1 hour and had so much fun. Thank you Morsie. Daughter also liked them.(She was the first to read both!)
