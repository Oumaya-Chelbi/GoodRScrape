So what happened in the graphic novel was that it covered the major plot points of Champion but it left out all the emotional in betweens needed to make it great. I don't know why they didn't just make this longer. It was only 83 pages long on my ereader and I thought maybe I was miss a part but nope, that was legitimately the whole thing.I loved seeing the art work and putting a picture to a name and seeing certain scenes play out but this definitely could have been soooooooo much better. If I had read this first, I don't think it would have been as emotionally destroyed as I was when I finished the novel this week and that would have been a shame. I would have missed out on the beautiful impact of the story and no one should lose out on that.I would highly suggest reading the entire trilogy in their novel forms before picking up any of the graphic novels cause you really do get a different experience when reading it in this format. I think I've only read Legend and now Champion in this form so I need to grab Prodigy from my library at some point though Iâ€™m in no rush right now.Happy reading peepsJo
