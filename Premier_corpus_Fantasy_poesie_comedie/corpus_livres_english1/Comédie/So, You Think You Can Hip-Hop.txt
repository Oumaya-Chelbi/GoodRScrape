I'm thankful that the other Goodreads reviews pointed out the body shaming in this comic so I didn't have to. It's not as often as it used to be to see a character who's only character trait is to not only revolve around nothing but her weight but to only discuss and think about food. It would be one thing if the joke was that the girls had a restrictive diet to keep being athletic and they wanted to splurge before the rehearsal, but the majority of the jokes revolve around the one girl who isn't even overweight, just has an average body type compared to the cartoonishly thin girls. It's pretty irresponsible given that the audience is young girls, but also dancers who do have to deal with body shaming in real life. It's also obvious that this was written and drawn by two men and one woman, given not only the body type of every female character but how they all have large chests. I also may just be saying this as an American reader, but some of the jokes make me question what age range this is for. Some of the jokes are explained so blatantly that it seems intended for very young children, but then they go to a party and a guy is groping a girl in the background (though maybe this could have been a background gag that they thought would go over the kid's heads). On the positive side, as someone who used to do ballet, a number of the gags were funny. While not every joke landed, the comic has the plotless feel of an Azumanga Daioh or a better full-page newspaper strip. Aside from the body shaming, the art stands out when the characters have pretty decent dancer proportions, and the backgrounds are detailed for a gag strip. But overall the comic itself is pretty average. If a kid or someone else you know is into ballet then they might enjoy this, though "To Dance" by Siena Cherson Siegel is way, way better and lacks the body shaming aspect. I at least wouldnâ€™t mind picking up the next installment.
