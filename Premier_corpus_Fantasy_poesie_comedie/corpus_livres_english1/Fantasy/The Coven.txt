“Sit, please. I have something I’d like to discuss with you first.”“Ooo… we’re using good manners. Am I in trouble?”“That depends. Do you want me to punish you, Witchling?”“Am I going to enjoy it?”“Why wouldn’t you?”I saw it all coming but.Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.Fuck.Fuuuuuuck.(‼️‼️𝐀𝐁𝐎𝐔𝐓 𝐓𝐇𝐄 "𝐖𝐈𝐋𝐋𝐎𝐖'𝐒 𝐀𝐆𝐄" 𝐃𝐈𝐒𝐂𝐎𝐔𝐑𝐒𝐄‼️‼️I've seen a few reviews here on GR and on Amazon where readers commented on the fact that the relationship between Willow and Grey is problematic because he's an immortal and she's 16. Now, I agree that the "romance" was on the toxic side (but you'll have to read the book yourself to get why I'm saying this) and I really don't care if people loved or hated this because everyone has different tastes and reasons to love or hate a book, but it'd be sad if people who haven't read this novel didn't give it a chance due to false information.The main character, Willow, is NOT 16. She is, in fact, 20 years old, and it's clearly stated in the ebook version I have.I'll add the passage where her age is mentioned under the spoiler tag:“A new witch has made herself known to us,” Susannah explained, sitting up straighter upon her dais. She looked to the lines of symmetry at her side, to the twelve witches who led each of the houses within the town. They were representatives of the original sixteen families that founded Crystal Hollow—all that remained of those noble lines in the centuries that had passed.“Then surely, she can merely attend next year? If she’s sixteen, she’s far too young to begin at Hollow’s Grove for another four years,” I said, spinning in a circle slowly as I waited for any of those gathered to echo the sentiment. Hollow’s Grove required all students to be at least twenty years of age, given the proclivities that happened within the school walls once a week when the Reaping came.[...]“She’s not sixteen, merely hidden from our sight for four years after her awakening.She is the last of a founding family, Alaric. Surely, even you can understand that it is of the utmost importance that she is brought to Hollow’s Grove immediately,” Susannah explained.“How has she remained hidden all this time? Why didn’t you know she existed before now?”So, you see, the romance is still questionable, but the fmc is not a minor as some readers claim, and if you're an avid romantasy reader who enjoys books like ACOTAR and all that jazz, you might not find the age difference that problematic, after all.I wonder, however, if the version I have is an edited one because some other people told me theirs doesn't have these paragraph I've just shared.I promise I'll get to the bottom of it 🫡𝐔𝐏𝐃𝐀𝐓𝐄: I ended up texting the author on IG and, paraphrasing, here's what she told me:She (Willow)'s always been 20. The book had a paragraph edited because some readers were confused that because witch powers manifest at 16, and Willow is a new student, then they thought that made her 16 when the reality was she was just in hiding when her powers manifested and the coven was unaware of her existence. I edited to add clarity to avoid confusion, but she was never 16. I don't roll that way 🤣 [...] I obviously wasn't clear enough in the original draft, and my editing team missed it because they all know I wouldn't write about a 16 year old.😅And then:Just wanted to thank you! Because you mentioned it. I decided to verify to be safe and downloaded the ebook that the new publisher has up and it looks like somehow in the takeover on amazon, it reverted to the previous version that doesn't have that sentence. My agent is contacting the publisher so they can fix it until the official re-release with the new edits in August.Soooooooooooo...here's the truth, people!)***🦴𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗖𝗢𝗩𝗘𝗡 - 𝗛𝗔𝗥𝗣𝗘𝗥 𝗟.

Its gothic aura emphasized by Woods' exquisite writing and the sharp edges she gifted her characters with.I love that you're catapulted into the no-frills story right away. And by this I mean that the pain starts immediately and it only grows from there.The magic system based on nature and elements was a brilliant touch.The mystery aspect of the story was well developed, as were the witch/demon lore and the characters' backstories and motivations.On a technical level, The Coven has its flaws, some bigger than others, some totally forgettable.BUT, it belongs to that particular category of books you can't help but enjoy despite the things that should tarnish it because it was everything your reader's heart needed in that moment.Right book, right time, basically.Willow is a fierce and intense protagonist, a powerful woman who lets no one walk all over her and who'd do anything for the ones she loves.I relate, but I also fangirl over her super hard.And then there's Gray.Gray...Fucking Gray.Fucking Gray, as in: Fucking (verb), Gray (direct object).Because, yes, I want to freaking smother him with a pillow right now, but I also have a very annoying crush on his sexy, betraying ass.*shakes fist* Damn you and your impossibly hot name, Alaric Grayson Thorne.Speaking of hot.The dark romance was simply magnetic. The connection between Willow andsexy assholeGray is palpable; their banter and sarcastic conversations could totally rival their steamy scenes in terms of chemistry.HLW's smut is delicious.There was a scene towards the end that had Koisty and I a little confused about our feelings about it, not gonna lie.We exchanged notes, metaphorically shook hands and agreed once again that we're both pretty much fucked up when it comes to the stuff we like in our books.So, yeah, it was good.Very good.The ending was a little predictable, honestly.I've seen the twist coming from a mile, but I enjoyed the book anyway.I guess this fact only confirms just how good this actually is.And now I can't wait for the sequel.I've picked upWhat Lies Beyond the Veillast year and ended up DNFing it, but I'm gonna give it another try someday. I think this author has the potential to become a favorite.Or maybe this is simply a book that has my name all over it.Who knows.The only certain thing I know about this book is that:"Gray being alive (or technically unalive) is enough for me to stop breathing😩"-Miss Lyra, 2023_____BR with the EMOJI GANG (🐈‍⬛Lyra, 🐠Koisty, 🦦Leni & ☀️Lila).We are cute, but we read naughty books😏
