"Magnificent!! Hilarious!! Also... Informative! ; ) "^^^ The comments above were insisted upon by my son, when I read this to him at the library a few days ago. Granted, he is 16... but he was having a rough day, and on a whim, we decided to read children's books together, sitting in the rocking chairs, in the children's section of the library. This was the result.The humor in this picture book is pure stress relief, for us, at least. This is the tale of a boy who adores dragons, and of the dragons themselves, who adore tacos. This boy really wants to have a taco party, in order to have dragon houseguests, and so begins the fun.There's a great deal of tongue-in-cheek humor, as the author gives us quasi-serious 'information' about why dragons love tacos so much, and how to host a taco party for them. The writing is simple and whimsical, a bit repetitive - but repetition in this case is a technique that will keep younger listeners (pre-readers) hooked. There's a very basic problem/solution plot-line, easily comprehended by kiddos.The illustrations are what originally caught my eye: my artist child says they were most likely done with watercolors, and the result is a combination of fun, funny, and attractive. The dragons are hilarious: many different shapes and colors, quirky facial expressions and poses, different personalities indicated by their actions. The larger portion of the story is told through the illustrations, so be sure to take time to savor them. We especially liked the banana-shaped dragons in flight!Recommended for children ages 4 to 10, and for the adults who love to read to them, or with them.ALSO recommended for grumpy teenagers who secretly wish that they were still young enough to fit on Mommy's lap, in the rocking chair...
