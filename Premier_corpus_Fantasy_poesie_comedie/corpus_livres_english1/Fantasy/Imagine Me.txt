”What happened to you, man?” I whisper. “Where’d you go?”“Hell,” he says. “I’ve finally found hell.”Me too, Ladies and Gentlemen, me too! >_<Hell was reading this book and you better get yourself some chocolate before you continue to read because I’m so bitter that I could be mistaken for a lemon. I’m not just bitter though, I’m salty as well. So buckle up this is going to be a spicy ride. (Okay, I’m done with the food hints now. *lol* You get the idea! ;-P)This book was just ... URGH!!I’m so disappointed right now I’ve been fighting to find the proper words for at least two weeks. And I just realized that I’ll probably never find them. >_< I think the most important thing you have to know is that I loved the original trilogy! It was so good and I’m such a huge Tahereh Mafi fan! Moreover I actually enjoyed books 4 and 5! They were different but they were still good! So what went wrong? A LOT!!! Or basically everything!Seriously, if it wouldn’t have been for my belovedJellowho had thequestionablepleasure to experience my disappointment first hand I most certainly would have never made it through this book! So a huge shout-out to Jello for surviving this buddy read with me! *lol* You’re the best, girl! And I swear I would have never made it through this book without your support! <333 So thank you so much for keeping me company on this hard ride. XD It was tough for both of us but we got through it somehow! *sighs* This said let’s get to the root of the problem:”My questions are endless.I kill them.”Oh, how I wish I would have had the same luxury!!!Unlike Juliette I couldn’t just kill my questions though and instead of getting answers all I got was a headache and even more questions than before. There happened so many things that left question marks above my head and NONE, really NONE were answered! You’d think an author who writes the last book in a series that consists of 6!!! (SIX!!!) books in total would try to wrap it up all nicely in the end? Nope! Nah, Nuh-uh. Nopedy nope! I didn’t get my awesome ending wrapped up in a lovely bow and I’m so bitter about it! So, so bitter! And this comes from a fan that loved and read all the former books, mind you! I’m not writing this rant because I dislike Tahereh’s books or because I want to make her feel bad, I’m writing this rant because ILOVETahereh and her writing style and I can’t believe that she would write such an ending!!! I just can’t wrap my head around it!”It is only in the desperate seconds before death that we realize the windows against which we broke our bodies were only mirrors, all along.”What went wrong Tahereh? Why give us such a sloppy ending even though we know you are a magnificent writer?! Where did your amazing and beautiful writing style go? I missed it during the entire book. The fact that I only wrote down 4 quotes from a book that consists of 450 pages should already tell us enough! After reading all the other books I couldn’t even pack all those lovely and beautiful quotes into my reviews. I had no problem this time around. In fact I had to go looking for those 4 quotes so that I actually COULD put something into this review. *shakes head*Still, the writing style wasn’t the only thing that made me sad. I also missed the amazingness of my beloved characters. They used to be complex, they had character arcs and they developed. They grew and changed over time. In this book it was like they all went back to their starting point and couldn’t be more than stereotypes. Which is such a shame! And don’t even get me started on Juliette/Ella!WTH, Tahereh?!!! I hated Robo-J so much and whenever I read “Yes, sir!” I felt like I wanted to puke!! What was the point in making her bland like that? That entire thing with Anderson and his sadistic streak, the fact that Juliette was attracted to HIM??!! WHAT DID I EVEN READ HERE?? At times it felt like I jumped right into a twisted and revolting version of “50 Shades of Grey” and the obedient/dull soldier looking up to her dominant master theme was THE WORST and so didn’t work for me!!!Another thing that riled me big time was that the main topic of those last 3 books was Emmaline and then we barely get anything about her. The first 10% of the book and then... nothing! Like she wasn’t important enough to keep the plot moving. Instead we get... moments that made me want to tear my hair out! >_< And to add insult to injury we get an epilogue that was so unsatisfying that I sat there crying into the book! Not because it was so good, but because it made my heart bleed all over the pages by not being what I wanted it to be. T_TThis book should have been named “Torture Me” instead of “Imagine Me” but if I have to go with the theme, I’ll do it my way (and this is where it gets salty, my friends):“Imagine Me” borrowing Winston's whiskey flask and taking a big swig in order to get through this book. *lol* Thank you, Winston! ;-P“Imagine Me” throwing this book against a wall.“Imagine Me” setting it on fire and then chucking it out of the window.And “Imagine Me” letting it being run over by a car only to get drenched in rain! All for good measure, of course! ;-)“Imagine Me” hoping for a great ending and getting THIS and...A DOG!!! Not even a wedding but a freaking dog??! I understand why Tahereh wrote that scene but I really would have rather wanted to read their wedding scene! Damn it!“Imagine Me” and my face falling when I realized this was neither about Emmaline nor about my OTP.I mean Juliette and Warner’s relationship was basically non-existent! They spent about 90% of this book apart and then he KISSES her back into her mind??!! Like seriously? Are you kidding me? Juliette doesn’t even recognize, let alone remember Warner, but she makes out with him? How could Tahereh reduce their beautiful and deep relationship to nothing but physical attraction? There was so much more than that between them and it was the physical aspect she latched on to?!! WE (the fans) and Warner & Juliette deserved so much better than that!!!“Imagine Me” being one of Tahereh’s biggest fans but being so damn salty I could turn a lake into the sea. If you ever come across an Austrian lake that’s as salty as the Black Sea: I’m sorry, that was me! XD“Imagine Me” getting whiplash from shaking my head too much! My neck hurts, no kidding!“Imagine Me” losing my appetite every single time Juliette said “Yes, sir!” (I need to eat lots of Christmas cookies to compensate for that!!)“Imagine Me” wanting to erase the memory of this book with bleach! Yes, I’m that desperate! Come to think of it Evie and Max would come in pretty handy right now.“Imagine Me” collapsing under the weight of all those question marks, because let’s face it: This book was all over the place! I feel like Atlas and it’s no fun!And last but not least: “Imagine Me” renaming this book “Torture Me”!The only good thing about “Torture Me” was Warner’s and Kenji’s bromance! Well, and this quote:”To the world, she is formidable.To me?She is the world.”That’s it!My fan heart is so broken right now, I want to “imagine” a world with a better ending than this! T_TOkay, I’m done with the puns and I’ve vomited all my bitterness into this review.I’m sorry to say it but I can’t give this more than 2,5 stars rounded up to 3. (I really wish we’d have half-stars here because 2,5 would be way more accurate than 3.) 2,5 stars because otherwise it would feel like I’d let Tahereh get away with this disaster of a book and someone has to speak the truth. As a huge fan of this series my heart is bleeding but I stand by my opinion! #SorryNotSorryLet’s hope Mafi’s next book will be better again!_______________________________Buddy read with my one and onlyJ.!(Should I call you “Jello” now? *lol* 😜)I’m not gonna lie: I’m kinda scared about what will happen in this one, but as long as I’m reading“Imagine Me”with you I shall be fine! ;-)Let’s fight through this!Together we cansurvivemake it.I mean, how bad can it be?! *they said right before the shit hit the fan* XD______________________________OMG!!Wait!What?!When did this become a thing, how come I didn't know about this?Since when is there a cover?GAHHHHHH!*has a mental breakdown*Okay,I'm fine now.THIS.COVER.THOUGH!!!*whimpers*
