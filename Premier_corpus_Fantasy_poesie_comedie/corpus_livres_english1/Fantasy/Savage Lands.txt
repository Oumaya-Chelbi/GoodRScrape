⚜𝐔𝐏𝐃𝐀𝐓𝐄⚜ May is gonna be a busy month work wise for me so I'm starting my Re-reads of The Savage Lands series now, and will continue with the rest throughout the month until Shadow Lands gets released. i can do it.Now after all this time and books I've read since this one you'd think i would feel less obsessed and in love with these characters, but 𝐘𝐎𝐔 𝐖𝐎𝐔𝐋𝐃 𝐁𝐄 𝐖𝐑𝐎𝐍𝐆 like so, so wrong it's painful. It's actually worse and that does 𝐍𝐎𝐓 bode well for me since this is the least chaotic, sexy, full of angst book of the series. It's gonna be a looooooong month.]|I{•---------⋘⋙---------------•⪼⦕࿅⦖⪻•---------------⋘⋙---------•}I|[I usually stay out of booktok and the hype surrounding books because it always ends up being a disastrous waste of time for me. Since my brain is a 𝐂𝐀𝐍𝐓𝐀𝐍𝐊𝐄𝐑𝐎𝐔𝐒 𝐁*𝐓𝐂𝐇 and can be illogical at times, as in, you can take two book in the same level of greatness and i will love one and hate the other even if doesn't make sense.But then again it is impossible to completely avoid them and recently all I've been seeing are updates of people discovering this series or Re-reading it. Eventually peer pressure got to me. So here I am taking a Leap of faith with this series since my last hype book was a ball of regret and frustration.But 𝐆𝐎𝐃𝐃𝐀𝐌𝐍 if i wasn't rewarded. I ate this up so fast i shocked myself. When i turned the last page my brain zipped around, trying to compute everything that i just read.𝐈𝐓 𝐖𝐀𝐒 𝐃𝐈𝐑𝐓𝐘. 𝐅𝐈𝐋𝐓𝐇𝐘. 𝐇𝐘𝐏𝐍𝐎𝐓𝐈𝐂.

She did suffered loss but she still 𝐋𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐝 𝐀 𝐒𝐡𝐞𝐥𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐝 𝐀𝐧𝐝 𝐒𝐩𝐨𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐝 𝐋𝐢𝐟𝐞. Even as a fighter she never actually met other Fae kind and that left her in an even bigger disadvantage. Now nothing would have actually prepared her for The House Of Death but even flawed her training did helped and saved her life, since the moment she arrived within those walls. And i loved how 𝐒𝐡𝐞 𝐒𝐚𝐰 𝐀𝐧𝐝 𝐀𝐜𝐤𝐧𝐨𝐰𝐥𝐞𝐝𝐠𝐞𝐝 her own flawed belief system and the weaknesses in her skills and strength.I was really impressed and very proud of how well she adapted herself to her new environment. What she lacked for in knowledge she made up with her fast learning and adaptation skills. She didn't go there with a chip on her shoulder thinking she was better than everyone, no she was 𝐂𝐚𝐥𝐜𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠. 𝐎𝐛𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐧𝐠. 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐄𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠 so she could have a chance to Survive. Even when those actions scareed her soul, she Still got up no matter how many times she went down. 𝐒𝐡𝐞. 𝐍𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫. 𝐒𝐭𝐨𝐩𝐩𝐞𝐝. 𝐅𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠. And her friendships with Tad, Kek, Opie, Bitzy, Lynx and Rosie was so precious, they must be protected at all cost.But you know at some point i did asked myself if this woman wasn't walking around with a neon sign saying “𝐅𝐈𝐆𝐇𝐓 𝐌𝐄.”“This place had fostered hate within me; it was the primary emotion driving me now. Prisons thrived on breaking people down and rebuilding them. Maybe it worked for others, bad people. But when you broke down good people, we didn’t rise again as even nicer people. No. That’s not how it worked. We rose like a dragon, one that would spew fire and burn everything to ash.We became the depraved. [...] Now I felt nothing. I was past hunger, past exhaustion, past sanity. They wanted to rip the humanity out of me? I hoped they were ready for what they asked for.[...] The part of me that didn’t want to kill anyone was smothered in pure adrenaline and survival instinct; it was kill or be killed. I did not want to die, not tonight.”]|I{•---------⋘⋙---------------•⪼⦕࿅⦖⪻•---------------⋘⋙---------•}I|[Now Warwick Farkas the way they kept feeding off each others energy and aura was gold. Their relationship was primal, sexual, powerful, sensual and the tension. . .My my my. And you add the mystery of his existence and their bond in the mix and we have a 𝐑𝐚𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐠. 𝐁𝐮𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠. 𝐈𝐧𝐟𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐨 in our hands.“His nose dragged up the side of my neck, causing goosebumps to bloom over my skin. He tipped up his head, smirking arrogantly. “You are getting off on this too, princess. Makes you feel alive, doesn’t it?” He clutched my thigh, tugging it up, rocking into me, kindling sparks through me. A moan formed in my throat, my body greedy to feel more. The energy in the arena pulsed and bled over us, heightening my emotions to the extreme. Death. Sex.[...] Feral and crude. I lost all civility, craving him to take me right here, feeling the high of his hands wrapping around my throat, stealing the last drops of my life as he thrust into me. I even liked the idea of everyone watching. The energy pulsed through me like a drug.I curved into him with the impulse. He sucked in, swearing under his breath, his grip on my leg digging into my skin, his eyes blazing. He felt as if he were everywhere over me, inside and out. Taking over. And I pushed the same sensation out, wanting to consume and be consumed.” [...] Everything about him felt like yin and yang. Conflicting. Challenging. Life. Death.”]|I{•---------⋘⋙---------------•⪼⦕࿅⦖⪻•---------------⋘⋙---------•}I|[The 𝐒𝐞𝐥𝐟-𝐫𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐞𝐨𝐮𝐬𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬 of the fae and human was unfruating because they were the same, just bullies with an overinflated sense of self worth. In the end they were all just numbers, couldn't they see that. The fae are like you're just a pest to me, i can kill you easily. Yeah well so could a monkey, you're not that special.Boyd needs to Die. Hexxus will have a double death, i will shove that whip so far up his ass it will be lost forever. I have my own kill list for this series and i'm sure it will grow like a wildfire the more books I'll read.⋘⋙--------•⪼⪻•--------⋘⋙What pissed me off even more was Aron, he was like I'm in love with you while getting ready to kill her. Like 𝐖𝐓𝐅 and then he had the audacity to look hurt when she didn't took his declaration to heart. Like in what world does you telling her *for everyone to hear* that the only way she looks good was beneath you screaming your name, proves your love and respect for her.

Excuse you. 𝐁*𝐓𝐂𝐇 where do you get off thinking you had any right to do so. The dude was too much of a coward who didn't have the balls to admit he had feelings for her but made sure to c*ckblock her so she didn't get any while he had plenty. The 𝐅#𝐂𝐊𝐈𝐍𝐆 hypocrisy is killing me. These men are like *I love you you're everything i want* but are useless when it matters. One didn't fight for her when his father was going to sell her to an abusive a**hole and the other was ready to kill her without hesitation. Yeah they can both rot in hell together for all I care.Please do not make this a love triangle or I will die. Brex didn't suffer all of this to lower herself for him. She has to know 𝐇𝐄𝐑 𝐖𝐎𝐑𝐓𝐇 𝐀𝐍𝐃 𝐈𝐓. 𝐈𝐒. 𝐍𝐎𝐓. 𝐇𝐈𝐌. Not even close.]|I{•---------⋘⋙---------------•⪼⦕࿅⦖⪻•---------------⋘⋙---------•}I|[One thing that I didn't like was the opening chapter. She kept saying how good a thief she was and how this was her 5th heist and she's never been caught and the guards never knew she was there until she's back in her bed.

I know it's such a small scene and that in the Scale of Importance it doesn't really register as a blip in the story but it kinda bugged the hell out of me. Even tho I know why the author did it, but still since she will get caught (well technically she'll get shot) and then thrown in jail, the author could've forgo the failed attempt. And again I know it's such a minor detail that didn't hurt the story but it got stuck with me. Like a leech. Not really my fault, as i said my brain can be a capricious b*tch at times. But to end this with 𝐓𝐇𝐈𝐒 cliffhanger!? 𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐃𝐀𝐌𝐍 𝐀𝐔𝐃𝐀𝐂𝐈𝐓𝐘...
