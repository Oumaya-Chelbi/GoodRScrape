Winter Roses after Fallwas a topical read for me. The poems by both Drake and Sin are brief and episodic. Still, I wanted more from this collection.A huge roadblock for me was how specific some(most?)of the poems were written to be. I felt as though Drake and Sin opted out of capturing the feelings and emotionality of heartbreak in order to allow for an explicit explanation oftheirspecific experiences. At times, this felt like looking behind the curtain—the magic of poetry was dulled by a constant inclination towards confessionalism.I did find a few poems that I enjoyed, though not necessarily because of their writing. Rather, there are little blurbs of helpful advice and offerings of perspective. This could be read as a late-night text exchange between friends who are both still "getting it all out" after a breakup—some of it is relatable, but it falls short of sophistication.
