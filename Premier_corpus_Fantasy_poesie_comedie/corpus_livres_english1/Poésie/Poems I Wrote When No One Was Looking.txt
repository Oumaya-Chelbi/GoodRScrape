These 100 poems will have kid-appeal, and it's practically a guarantee that each of your students will find more than one to like. What makes the verses so funny is that some of them are downright silly and perfect for children. Upper elementary and middle graders are sure to smile at "Fridge-a-Dare" with its lines about what happens to grapes lost in a bedroom or "Shhhhh..." that describes someone overwhelmed by noise and "onomatopoeiaing" (p. 36). Part of the book's appeal derives from the clever poem titles too; many of them have double meanings and can be taken in several ways. The pen illustrations complement the poems quite well, caricaturing children in different ways. Who knew that school, libraries, and museums could be so much fun? Add this one to your classroom or personal collection and nurture the love of poetry.
