4/9/19I'm going to go see Andrea live tonight and I'm kinda sorta maybe absofuckinglutely beside myself with glee.This is my glee face ðŸ˜ƒNow you know.__________________________________Andrea Gibson introduced me to the power of poetry.I thought verse was all flowers and love and a bunch of other crap that, not only could I not relate to, I also couldn't give one single solitary f#ck about.YouTube is where my love affair with Andrea began. After inadvertently coming across a spoken word video (I was most likely watching pimple popping videos at the time) my view on poetry changed.I changed.I became educated on the LGBTQ community in a way that was relatable and tangible. I had gay friends, isn't that what every heterosexual person says? I realized they weren't really friends because I didn't know them as intimately as I did my straight friends. I naively thought I knew the life that they had and continued to endure because I watched that one movie that one time that had a gay guy in it. I watched Queer Eye and The L Word and considered myself enlightened.My level of ignorance was shameful at best.After devouring every video I could find, I then ordered the book The Madness Vase. My very first poetry purchase.Next, I drove four hours to go and witness these words that I had fallen in love with spoken by their architect.Words had never had such an effect on me before that live spoken word performance. I was gutted and resuscitated, my heart injured and then revived. I was a mass of emotions and then I realized I was crying. Out of embarrassment, I glanced around to see if anybody was looking at me only to discover that the entire audience was in tears.I'm going to see my second live performance by Andrea on April 9, 2019. I'm bringing tissues this time.This new book is beyond words, it is simply something that you must experience for yourself. It is now available in paper and ebook form.As someone that has suffered with panic disorder for 23 years, ODE TO THE PUBLIC PANIC ATTACK resounds with me on a level I never thought possible, giving me words to describe the indescribable._________________________________________________A very small excerpt fromODE TO THE PUBLIC PANIC ATTACKIf you've never had a panic attack,there's a good chance that you'vebeen an ass to someone who has.JUST RELAXand CALM DOWNalways seem like helpful thingsto scream if oxygenhas never been over your head,if your body has never been it's own corset.______________________________________________Thank you, Andrea, for sharing your words with the world and for being you.I received an ARC from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.
