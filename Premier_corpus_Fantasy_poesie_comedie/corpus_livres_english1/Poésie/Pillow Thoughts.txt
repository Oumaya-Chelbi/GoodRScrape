// I received an ARC of this book via Netgalley in exchange of an honest review //"I hate to spoil the endingbut You is fineYou is still hereYou is going to make it"I like how each section is labeled on what you are feeling right now and what mood you are in when you read it. I have always wished there were poems books that were like this because it would be so helpful. . . and now I found one.Some of the poems were too straight forward for my taste and I was not a fan of all of them. This was actually my only main problem the whole time I was reading it. But there were ones that really touched me (like, seriously, they touched my heart. . . literally one tear drop down my eye type) and I liked how the poems are not just thrown together and there is actually some find of flow to it in each section if you pay attention to it enough. A lot are pretty much related in a way. If ever the reader gets to reading everything."Be you, even when its hard."The bluntness of this is not all bad because it actually tells the readers straight up what the author thinks and feels. It does not sugarcoat anything, especially the topics here that really matters (loneliness, heartbreak). This is what I interpreted from it though. And that last poem. . . pure. Just, pure love.Poems are always your own interpretation of what you are reading. . . practically all books are.And can I just say. . . the jellyfishes. are so cute. they stole me and sold me into reading this and finishing it. And don't you just love that metaphor? The jellyfish tends to hurt everyone, but inside, they are soft creatures.As the book said, you just have to have people with the same heart as you.This is definitely a book I would go back to again and again."But all I was trying to do,was show you that even a monster can be loved"
