A mystic lyricism and precise imagery often marked verse of German poetRainer Maria Rilke, whose collections profoundly influenced 20th-century German literature and includeThe Book of Hours(1905) andThe Duino Elegies(1923).People consider him of the greatest 20th century users of the language.His haunting images tend to focus on the difficulty of communion with the ineffable in an age of disbelief, solitude, and profound anxiety â€” themes that tend to position him as a transitional figure between the traditional and the modernist poets.His two most famous sequences include theSonnets to Orpheus, and his most famous prose works include theLetters to a Young Poetand the semi-autobiographicalThe Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge.He also wrote more than four hundred poems in French, dedicated to the canton of Valais in Switzerland, his homeland of choice.
