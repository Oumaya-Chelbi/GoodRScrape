In this sweet and enchantingly lyrical marriage of text and images, in Minfong Ho'sHush! A Thai Lullaby, a Thai mother repeatedly admonishes the fauna in both her domicile and the neighbouring woods to "hush" (as her baby is supposedly sleeping). The presented onomatopoeic diverse animal sounds (from the wee-wee of a tiny mosquito to the hoom-praa of a massive elephant) combined with the soothing cadence and rhythm of the author's repetitive verses become increasingly soothing and almost somniferous (although ironically and very much humorously, even after all of the animals as well as the mother are indeed and finally fast asleep, the baby alone remains awake, his eyes bright, round and alert). Now while in and of themselves Holly Meade's accompanying illustrations are not what I would consider personal favourites (I love their general descriptive expressiveness and colour scheme, but the depictions of some of the domestic animals do seem a trifle stagnant and lacking expressivity if contrasted with, say, the lizard, the monkey and the elephant) they do work exceedingly well in conjunction with the text, not only mirroring but also quite massively expanding on Minfong Ho's verses (showing the architecture and layout of a typical Thai house, with its open concept living/sleeping quarters, the adjacent rice barn, but especially and with a delightful sense of visual irony demonstrating that all the while the mother is pleading with the animals to keep down their noise so as not to awaken her infant, the little nipper is actually not only wide awake but out and about, gallivanting around the house). Highly recommended isHush! A Thai Lullaby(and most definitely worthy of the Caldecott Honour Medal awarded, although on a personal reading enjoyment level, only a high three star book for me, lovely, descriptive but not spectacular).
