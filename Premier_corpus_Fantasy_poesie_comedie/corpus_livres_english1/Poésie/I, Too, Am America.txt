Text to TextThis book told a story in an amazingly similar and amazingly different way than the book I read right after it, "This is the Rope." Both focused on the journey African Americans have taken in America and the struggles they have faced. "I, Too, Am American" shows how the porters shared their knowledge with others so everyone would have the an equal opportunity to learn. They were distributing their knowledge in hopes for a better future for the next generation. This story explained through a poignant poem and large illustrations full of meaning in and of themselves. In "This is the Rope," the story shows how one family had this same dream for their children and passed down hopes, dreams, and aspirations for their children. The meaning was a bit more obvious in this book and did not speak to the same all-encompassing audience, but instead shared a more personal story that readers will hopefully be able to relate to as well.1.
