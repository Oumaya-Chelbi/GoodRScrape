Poetry4-6This book succinctly demonstrates the power of poetry: simple in concept, deeply moving.Written by a fifth-grade class after studying a mentor text poem, the first half is poems by the students to someone they feel they need to apologize to. These poems are funny and heartbreaking, but the tears came for me as I read several of the poems in the second half: the responses from the recipients of the first poems.As a teaching tool, this book is powerful because it is another class doing exactly the same thing our class might be doing- studying a mentor text and writing our own works. But it was professionally published, and now is used as a mentor text itself!As a work of art, this collection of poems tell the stories of average kids with average problems and average worries to a distinctly above-average effect. As I connected each response back to the original apology poem, I became invested in the lives of both parties. Will the school secretary forgive the boy for stealing jelly donuts out of the teacher's lounge? (Yes, but she still had to call his mother.) From over-enthusiastic dodge ball incident apologies between friends to an apology from a son to his mother for being a disappointment to her and a failure for not winning a spelling bee, the poems run the gamut of emotions and experiences.And the biggest tear-jerker? The response to the spelling bee failure: it was not written by his mother, but by another student in the class, with the byline noting that the poem is by the student in place of the mother, because the mother thought this was silly and pointless. (I'm paraphrasing, but that's the idea.) The poem from a father to his daughter telling her that his leaving the family was not her fault was also an emotional experience.What an example to students of how poetry can help us deal with our own emotions and also help us communicate with other people.Text set ideas: poetry, emotional awareness
