"Grace" (1)"The haunting voices of the starved and mutilated... I could say grace was a woman with time on her hands, or a white buffalo escaped from memory. But in that dingy light it was a promise of balance... And Wind, I am still crazy. I know there is something larger than the memory of a dispossessed people. We have seen it.""Deer Dancer" (5-6)"Of course we noticed when she came in. We were Indian ruins. She was the end of beauty. No one knew her, the stranger whose tribe we recognized, her family related to deer, if that's who she was, a people accustomed to hearing songs in pine trees, and making them hearts...Some people see vision in a burned tortilla, some in the face of a woman.This is a bar of broken survivors, the club of shotgun, knife wound, of poison by culture...How do I say it? In this language there are no words for how the real world collapses... So I look at the stars in this strange city, frozen to the back of the sky, the only promises that ever make sense...and that's when she broke, became human...That's what I'd like to know, what are we all doing in a place like this?... The way back is deer breath on icy windows...And then she took off her clothes. She shook loose memory, waltzed with the empty lover we'd all become.She was the myth slipped down through dreamtime. The promise of feast we all knew was coming. The deer who crossed through knots of a curse to find us...But I imagined her like this, not a stained red dress with tape on her heels but the deer who entered our dream in white dawn, breathed mist into pine trees, her fawn a blessing of meat, the ancestors who never left.""Mercy" (20)"Forget the massacres, proclamations of war, / rumors of wars. / I won't pour rifle shot through the guts of someone / I'm told is my enemy. / Hell, my own enemy is right here. / Can you look inside, see past the teeth worn down / by meat and anger, / can you see? / Sometimes the only filter / is a dead cat in the road... unless this light / becomes a bayonet of sound, hands of fire / to lead you to yourself / until you cry / mercy.""Eagle Poem" (65)"To pray you open your whole selfTo sky, to earth, to sun, to moonTo one whole voice that is you.And know there is moreThat you can't see, can't hear,Can't know except in momentsSteadily growing, and in languagesThat aren't always sound but otherCircles of motion.Like eagle that Sunday morningOver Salt River. Circled in blue skyIn wind, swept our hearts cleanWith sacred wings.We see you, see ourselves and knowThat we must take the utmost careAnd kindness in all things.Breathe in, knowing we are made ofAll this, and breathe, knowingWe are truly blessed because weWere born, and die soon within aTrue circle of motion,Like eagle rounding out the morningInside us.We pray that it will be doneIn beauty.In beauty."
