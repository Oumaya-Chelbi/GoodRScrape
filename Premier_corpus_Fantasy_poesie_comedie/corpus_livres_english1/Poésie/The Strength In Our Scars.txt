“I am a firm believer in there being beauty in the contrast. In the light and the dark days. In the hope and the hurt. In the fire and in the ash. I am a firm believer in the fall and in the rise; in the sin and in the saving. I am a firm believer in the broken, the people who hold their pieces together with belief, who bandage their fear in faith. I am a firm believer in the souls who have always managed to protect their soft; who have always known, even when it ached the most, that their wounds were healing them, that the hardest parts of life were growing them from the inside. I am a firm believer in there being beauty in the contrast—you have not lived until you have died.”This was such a lovely read.I docked one star, because I found some pieces to be a bit contradicting (but that's what life is, I suppose). I wish I could list all my favourite pieces here, but there were no titles (which I actually found refreshing).Side note: I would like to point out that this is not poetry, but prose. It reads a bit like a philosophical self-help book.“It is all I have lostthat has set me free.”“These places, they are not where you were born, but they will be where you are reborn.”
