An electrifying work of queer poetry, lyrics from a precise mind that never overstay their welcome, even with several over one page. Every word is essential, every piece is essential, and the technical virtuosity on display here ensures that MÃ³nica Gomery will prove to be a vital voice in contemporary poetry. In a collection of standout poems it is always difficult to pinpoint highlights without copy and pasting the entire poem to convey its cumulative effect. Several poems moved me to tears and forced me to pause and reread to fully grasp the weight of the piece. In "Prologue", which sits around the end of the first fifth, "The confusion I have felt; the trades my people have made for safety; someone else's / grief. Blue sifting into blue", forms the closest device this work has to a thesis. "Here" is a stunning look at how a small town responds to, and is complicit in gun violence, "The alderman uses the word loitering to deliver a violence against the people who've lived here for many years longer than you have." My favorite poem, and what I feel is very much the centerpiece, is "God Queers The Mountain, which follows "Here". It is one such poem that a quotation pulled from its context would be a direct injustice. The pieces ranks among the greatest poems on queer identity, struggle, and persistence. I look forward to this work's publication and I cannot wait to see the poetic magic Gomery cooks up next.
