‘If only I had a brilliant mind I’d waste away my days, for days As of this day, I am at waste, And still I lack a brilliant mind.’Armenian born author Vincent Hunanyan earned his degree in creative writing from UCLA. He now lives and writes in Stockholm.It is refreshing when a new poet offers an explanatory note about his art before the poems begin - from his stance we are more tied to his mission: ‘I believe that good poetry resonates with people on a metaphysical level; you can read a poem without quite being able to put into words why you enjoyed it. It could have been the shivers that ran down your spine or the elevating of your heartbeat. Or, it made you smile, or even cry; made you feel something. A key component of good poetry is honesty; much of the poetry in the world doesn’t speak to people because it is forced and pretentious. If what you write is true and honest, and you put some actual effort into it, I believe people will respond to it. I write only that which I know, that which I can feel and try to transcend to the reader through a few lines. Nothing else concerns me. I think that most people don’t read or appreciate poetry because they have been exposed to too much poor poetry, and been told by their professors to interpret them in a certain way, like there is a science to interpreting a poem. There isn’t; poetry, just like any other piece of artistic creation, is subjective. You cannot ruin someone's interpretation of a poem by explaining it. But if the poem doesn't speak for itself, ultimately, it is a failure.’A few examples of this impressive new poet follow:Romeo’s ElegyTo broken hearts, to broken dreamsTo me and you, to you and meTo all the friends and all the foes,To those who love and those who don'tTo those who have and those withoutTo parent's scorn, deprived of doubtTo those who give, to those who saveTo those afraid, and all the braveTo all the seconds, unforgivingTo the departed and all the livingTo those who dare, to those who careTo those in bliss and in despairTo all the smiles and all the laughs,To all we love, on love's behalfTo all the pain and single cryTo happiness and every high!City NightsIn solitude in bed I lieAnd all the while the sirens cryA homeless bastard passes byThe smell of urine rises highAnd hides away, above the skyForsaken dogs bark in the parkFireworks in distance sparkAnd I wake up, and still it’s dark.Sensitive, probing and holding thoughts that speak to each of us in our own needs, Vincent has succeeded in his first publication that his is a voice worthy of our following.
