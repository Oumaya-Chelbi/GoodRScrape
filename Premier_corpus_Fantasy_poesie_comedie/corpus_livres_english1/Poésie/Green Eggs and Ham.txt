I have indeed always very much lovedGreen Eggs and Ham, as both Dr. Seuss' poetic, rhythmic text and his accompanying illustrations are both entertaining and enchanting (a sweet delight, with movement, joy and exuberant silliness). And yet, the presented underlying message ofGreen Eggs and Hamalso shows a basic and important, necessary truth (to not simply and categorically insist that one does not enjoy a certain food, but to actually try it first, that one needs to at least taste a food before making a decision as to whether one likes it or not). That being said, I can also to a point appreciate that some individuals might well consider Sam-I-Am massively annoying, and even bordering on the offensive, with his continuous insisting, basically hounding if not actually stalking the other nameless character until he finally gives up and resignedly tries Sam's green eggs and ham. Thus, while I personally do very much adoreGreen Eggs and Hamand cherish the message of trying different foods that Dr. Seuss is trying to convey, I also do comprehend that for some, Sam-I-Am is at best tedious and a bit like a recurring mosquito annoyingly buzzing around one's ear.But actually, for my adult and educated self, for my language teacher/instructor self, the genius ofGreen Eggs and Hamactually now seems to lie NOT so much in the message of the presented narrative, but in Dr. Seuss' poetic, repetitive text in at of itself, in a text that with fun and rhythm introduces children to important tenets of English grammar and word usage (different verb forms, prepositions and negation are prominently featured inGreen Eggs and Hamand by repeating the author's words or by having them read aloud, children learn, children become accustomed to proper preposition usage, the differences between the future and the present tenses of verbs, modal verbs such as "can" and "should" and the position of the negative). A wonderful, marvellous combination of enjoyment and didactic intent, and highly recommended for both in-class and at home practice/use, and absolutely outstanding for ESL instruction (case in point, in grade four, after my family had immigrated from Germany to Canada, my homeroom teacher usedGreen Eggs and Hamwith me and it definitely made learning English verbs and the many different prepositions much easier and also much more fun to both learn and remember). And not just for children either, as I have also used theGreen Eggs and Hamas a fun introductory activity for novice adult ESL learners with lasting and successful results (with the caveat to NOT ONLY use material primarily meant and designated for children with adult learners, but that as a quick activity,Green Eggs and Hamis an enjoyable, teachable interlude).
