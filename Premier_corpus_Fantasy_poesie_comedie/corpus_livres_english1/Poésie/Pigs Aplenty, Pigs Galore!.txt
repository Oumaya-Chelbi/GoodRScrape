Pigs Aplenty, Pigs Galore! by David McPhail is a fictional story intended for children between Kindergarten and Second Grade. The story is about a man who is in his house reading a book, when his house is suddenly invaded by pigs. More and more pigs keep coming to the house and wonâ€™t leave.I really like the book because the rhymes are silly and the illustrations effectively animate the characters and the plot. The man becomes frustrated and demands that the pigs leave his house. The pigs protested, so the man said they could only stay with him if they helped clean up. The man and the pigs cleaned the house and went to bed.This book would fun for teachers to read aloud. The book would best be used for teaching phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, and comprehension. For phonemic awareness, teachers can have the students listen and pick out the rhyming words. For phonics, the teacher can have the students identify words that contain double letters such as yell and piggy. The teacher can also have the students identify words such as reading and feeding. For fluency, the teacher can model how to read with expression to show the difference between characters. For comprehension, the teacher can have the students retell the story orally in their own words.
