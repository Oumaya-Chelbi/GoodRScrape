During the last part of Ambleside Online Year 1, the poetry book called for was to choose from either A Child's Book of Poems or the Oxford Book of Poetry for Children. I chose A Child's Book of Poems primarily because it was simpler to find. The book itself is a quite lovely hardcover with lovely black and white and color illustrations. Here's what the children thought:Ellie (age 6): Five stars! I loved it!Connor (age 7): Four stars! It was pretty good. I liked the poems. (He had me put it on the bookshelf so that he could pull it out to read some of the poems again, and I thought that was a pretty good endorsement.)Emalee (age 11): One star. I only liked one poem, "The Fleas and the Fly." (This is the third poetry book in a row she's given one or two stars too. I'm beginning to think that she just doesn't like poetry. I think I should try a story in verse, like "Brown Girl Dreaming" to see if she would like that better.)Bennett (age 12): Four stars! I really like some of the poems. Others are way too short.As far as my thoughts go, this is a varied and wide ranging volume, and there are poems in here that every child and adult will like. Some of the poems are familiar, and others may be new, but they are all quality poems. They range from famous poems by authors names that I'm not as familiar with to poems by Dickinson, Tennyson, and Longfellow. The lovely illustrations make it a pleasure to read to children.
