This is a super fun poetry book with some silly rhymes that will have you laughing and picturing the words as you read. This book speaks with individuality and encourages young readers to be themselves. This book is a great way to get readers thinking about what the words mean and how these poems are expressing an underlying message. This book also discusses many things young readers could relate to such as not liking breakfast foods, parking lots filled with cars, building with blocks, and many other things. I really enjoyed how encouraging this book is; the story of each poem is unique and gets the reader thinking. This book could be great as a read-aloud for any age elementary student as it could be used in many different ways. This book could be a good way to get students engaged and interested in reading as well as poetry specifically. Teachers could use this book to have students think about what the poems are communicating and could also be used to challenge students to write their own poems. Teachers could read the book aloud, assign groups of students each a poem in the ebook and have them work together to analyze and understand that poem. Then students could share with others what they found and what the indicators were that led them to their understanding of the poem. There are also many words in this book that could be introduced as vocabulary words to students. Teachers could identify and define them with students before reading. Acknowledge their appearance in the book and how it was used and then have students use the words throughout the day and add them to a word wall. I think this book should be introduced to students in the elementary classroom because it's humorous, has interesting illustrations that can help students picture what they are reading, and is very engaging and relatable.
