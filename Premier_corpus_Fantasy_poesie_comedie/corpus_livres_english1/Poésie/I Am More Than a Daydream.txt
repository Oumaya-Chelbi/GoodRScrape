Reading through this very short collection, I am still amazed that poets have this ability to incite an emotion, or connect you so easily, with just a mere two or three sentences.Actually, let that sink in for a moment. A novelist can build you a fantastical world, and make you believe in these magical characters and creatures, and take you away on these grand adventures......but it's done within the length of an entire book. Fifty THOUSAND or MORE words.Jennae Cecelia, in her short bursts of anger,of pain,of curiousity,of empowerment,of embracing,of beauty, and self worth.She said it with very few words. Cecelia didn't need to build us a world where women felt fear and pressured. We have our society to thank for that. Instead she took our story - mine and yours - of heartache, of comparisons and standards of beauty, and used what we women know about those feelings of self worth, and gave us back more than our reflections on a looking glass. If eyes are the windows to our soul, and we barely make eye contact with everyone nowadays... than what are our reflections say about us tell only half of what we've been through. Peer closer. Really look at someone in the eye. There is always more to their story. But we get caught up in the physicality that we forget there's a person beneath all that falsehood, or bravada. We forget that in our own ways, EVERYONE is just trying to fit in and wanting to be loved, and accepted.She tells us in so many words that we matter. Within these pages, I am known. I felt seen and embolden in my approach to life and beauty. Though I already know I am more than a daydream. My hope is that you'll believe it too.....Cheers, sisters!***I received this book in exchange for an honest review. I am not required to write a positive one.
