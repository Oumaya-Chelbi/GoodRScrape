1. Due to many versions of this story, I could not find any awards for this specific book.2. This book is appropriate from grades Pre-K to Second Grade.3. Miss Mary Mack by Mary Ann Hoberman is a zany story and song about a girl named Miss Mary Mack who asks her mom for fifty cents to see an elephant jump over a fence. The elephant jumped so high that he didn't land from the jump until the Fourth of July. When he landed, he fell right into Miss Mary Mack's backyard and she was able to convince the elephant to keep him.4. This song/book is one of the more catchier songs from my childhood. The story is absolutely ridiculous and will definitely make younger children laugh. The nostalgia that I associate with this book/song definitely makes it worthwhile, although it can have the tendency to get annoying.5. I would use this book in the classroom to teach children how to identify rhymes. Since this book is a song, I would sing it and have my students clap every time they hear a rhyme. I would also use this book in an unconventional way in which I would read/sing the book backward with my students to show that rhymes are interchangeable.
