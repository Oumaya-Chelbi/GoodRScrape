I only like the “Childhood” Chapter ✨ but I can’t seem to give a rating since reading this make me understand what the author gone through & her feelings…but the book is just not for me.. so to give a rating is kinda hard because it feel like I’m rating her emotion & experience? So i decided not to rate 🫶🏼 here are the one i love ⬇️“i saw vulnerabilitydrip from myfather’s eyesfor the first timewhen i was twelvei learned thesweet sickbalance ofempathy and blame”•“i tried to find my fatherin different formseventuallyi realizedno man couldmake up forwhat he missed”•“i told you sois stillour wayof sayingi love you”•“i love youwith the tearswe have shed togetherthe blood that ranthrough your veinsinto mine the laughterthat somehow bringsmore tears all theunconditional lovewe still have hereto mom and dad”Excerpt FromWhen He Leaves YouMichaela AngemeerThis material may be protected by copyright.
