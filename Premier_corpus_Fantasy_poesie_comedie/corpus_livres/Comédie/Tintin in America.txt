When I first read Hergé'sTintin en Amériquein German translation (asTim in Amerika) as a child (and I guess I must have been about nine or ten years of age), I did indeed find the general storyline somewhat and mildly amusing. But even then (even at that time), I was already thinking that Hergé had been rather strangely loose with his fusing together 1920s-1930s Chicago gangster and organised crime culture with what can only be considered and described as the so-called Wild West (and its utterly stereotypical late 19th century Cowboys and Indians thematics and scenarios). Now the ethnic stereotyping, the cultural insensitivity to Native Americans did not chafe me so much as a child (especially since in Germany at that time, the rather similarly constructed and conceptualised tales of "Noble Savages" and especially the stories penned by authors like Karl May were both popular and often readily available as children's novels or in my case, as abridged vinyl record audio recordings of said tales), but already then did I most definitely feel that from a logical point of departure, the details presented inTintin en Amériquedid not really make all that much sense by any stretch of the imagination (and that 1930s Chicago, with its gangs, its prohibition era rum running, with Al Capone and other such villains simply did not fit in any fashion with the Wild West scenarios also depicted, as that was not the early and middle 20th, but the late 19th century).However, rereadingTintin en Amériqueas an older adult (and also as someone who has recently done a bit of research on Native Americans and how they have been and how they are depicted and approached in children's literature), well this story now just makes me utterly and completely cringe and yes, incredibly and lastingly angry. I mean, almost EVERYTHING related to the depictions of Native Americans inTintin en Amériqueis at best culturally insensitive and some of it does not in any way even make all that much logical and common sense. For example, the Native Americans depicted in the book are clearly supposed to be Great Plains tribes (I think they might have been Blackfoots), and thus they would NOT in any way have totem poles (these being coastal West Coast of North America traditions and culture). And while the level of presented and featured colonialism, while the level of paternalism and cultural, ethnic insensitivity encountered inTintin en Amériquemight well and indeed not be quite as singularly horrid and nasty as the previous instalment, as the truly almost viciously vileTintin au Congo(and while I do realise that some readers and literary analysts actually considerTintin en Amériqueas a bit of a satire of and against America), the culturally inappropriate and ethnically stereotyping depictions and descriptions of American Indians, combined with a timeline that simply and utterly fails the test of basic historical logic, these issues are enough for me to only consider but one star forTintin en Amériqueand to declare the book as not really to be recommended except for Tintin completists or for academic research and critical analysis purposes. For even if Hergé might have indeed wanted to present a critical condemnation of the exploitation of American Indians by corrupt business and governmental interests, one cannot really achieve this by using the very instruments of subjugation and cultural appropriation that have angered Native Americans since forever (and with good reason), one cannot really achieve this by portraying American Indians as cardboard one-dimensional ethnic stereotypes at best.
