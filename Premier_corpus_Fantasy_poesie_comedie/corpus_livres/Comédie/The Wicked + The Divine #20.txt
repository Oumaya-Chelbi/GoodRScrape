AAAAAAAMAZINGI'm truly impressed and fully satisfied with how the fourth arc is developing so far: many questions left open are getting complete answers and exhaustive explanations.In this issue we have the chance to reliveLaura'-EXCUSE ME, Persephone's supposed death through Inanna's and Baphomet's eyes(their comments resemble an awful lot my fangirling btw).The flashback is depicted with fresh new colour tones and distinctive designs that perfectly represent the underground. My heart aches at realising how much I actually missed McKelvie's incredible artwork.The multitude of beautifully planned pages (the usual black chapter-starter missing the gods' symbols? wow; the fire eating up ananke's page? HOLY FUDGE) makes me want to buy this issue and hang it up on my wall, right next to #5.We also get a little more insight into Baphomet's (NEGRAL??!?) character who keeps getting more interesting and complex. I have to admit I still don't get Urdr's usefulness or whole character but I don't mind that mystery staying the way it is.just wow, i'm expecting the major battle in the next issue,p.s. anyone else obsessed with the awesome covers?
