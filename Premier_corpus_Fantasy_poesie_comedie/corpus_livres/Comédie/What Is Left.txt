Elegant and cool, Valero-O'Connell leaves everything so open to the imagination, yet specific. This story (and it's seamless illustrations) have the feel of a surreal, space age dream. The ship we are on is fueled by one woman's dreams and memories and when it crashes our protagonist is stuck, with the source of the life that fuels the ship, in a sort of limbo. She can never REALLY know this person, yet she knows everything about them and she can never truly interact with the dreams and yet she sees every part of this girl's life, in no order in particular. Valero O'Connell is so talented, and so effortless in her composition and the flowing of a narrative through clean, smooth line and exact coloring. The colors in this book are more complex and still somehow less refined and paired down than the simple black, white, pink of 'Laura Dean keeps breaking up with me' but there is a LOT to look at and dive into, much like the memories being portrayed. I did find myself wishing the color in the entire book were as bold and dark as the breathtaking cover. This is a quick read! Read it twice in a row!
