so i dont have time to write a proper review because i'm rushing to read the next and tearfully final issue of thisa-m-a-z-i-n-gcomic so here are my thoughts jotted done shortly and hurriedly:-Persephone kicks ass-BAPHOMET'S COMMENTS IN THIS ISSUE ARE FREAKING GOLD AND INCREDIBLY WITTY I LOVE HIM-Ananke's evil is never ending, that machine gave me chills, i guess her dream job was to be a butcher-i adore how Woden's Valkyries&Co are subtly pixeled, it's such a thoughtful and awesome detail-how dumb can Baal be? just because the queen of evil said that's what they were going to say doesnt mean it isnt freaking true!!-Amaterasu????-"Shit, Becoming" dayum that title-the polls at the end entertained me for way too longnow sorry to dismiss you like this but the reader's is a busy lifebyeee
