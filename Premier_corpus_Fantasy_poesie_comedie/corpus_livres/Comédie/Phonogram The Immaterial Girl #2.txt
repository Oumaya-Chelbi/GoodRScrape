I never dreamt that I would get to be/ The creature that I always meant to be’ as a wise man once sang and Emily Aster probably should have listened more closely. Even though she’d probably have simply sneered at the very thought. I was a pop kid when I started out loving music; if you’re discovering music for yourself you almost certainly have the same experience. The bright hooks, beautiful people and imagery draw you in. I had every Madonna album, my first record was Ghostbusters. And then I started listening to white guys with guitars and, in the search for an adult identity, disowned the pop past, constructing myself around bands offering less simple sentiments and less immediate pleasures. And, as the issue unfolds, you can see that this is exactly what this issue’s about.Emily’s deal with the devil involved swapping her pop past for cool points and, like me when I got past my Indie Kid stage, it comes back to bite you on the backside when you realise the pleasures of simple pop records. For me the choice was easy; I happily adapted in the face of overwhelming evidence that sometimes three minutes of disposable wonder is enough. I suspect the question here will be whether Emily can do the same. And given it’s all wrapped in McKelvie’s usual superb art and Matt Wilson’s vivid colours with a bonus of some seriously fine recreations of iconic 80s pop videos this is an irresistible ride.
