Since I started reading this series in December, I've been wanting to write a review of it. I've read all the issues, I've ordered both volume compilations, and I follow the blogs. So I figured it was about time to write a review.The short is this: The Wicked + The Divine is the single greatest comic book series I have ever read and each issue just further proves that point for me.Not enough? Well alright then.The Wicked and the Divine has taken my favourite things in life: modern magic, reincarnation, ambiguous but awesome backstory, and queer as all get out peeps, and turned it into one of the most beautifully made comic books I have ever seen. The art is amazing. You know that thing where the cover art is WAY better than the inside art? Yeah that doesn't hold here. The inside art is JUST AS GOOD just SLIGHTLY less detailed. Sometimes not even enough to notice.Laura, our main character, is totally relate-able, absolutely amazing, and gets to chill with so many gods it makes me jealous.The gods the writers picked are perfect. The way the story is being told is perfect. The concept of using pop icons as the gods and then spinning them in such a way to have deeply flawed characters without lawsuits? Brilliant.I love it. I love every single part of it. I will recommend it to anyone who listens to me long enough for me to say "Wicked/Divine. Read it. Now." and shove the first issue at them.My only qualm? I want it to be bi-weekly. The wait is too much!
