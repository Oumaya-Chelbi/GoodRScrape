So I was ridiculously excited to see what was going to happen in this issue. After reading and ADORING Volume 1 and 2 (and THAT ENDING?!) I needed to know what was going to happen next and whilst this issue did give us a little insight, it ultimately wasn't quite what I was hoping for and the level of detail and excitement really wasn't there.For the next few issues the team have decided that they want to include a couple of new Guest Artists. I don't mind this of course because I fully support promoting new and upcoming artists who deserve a shot, however the problem comes when the series up until now has had SUCH a distinctive and beautiful style and that's been a MAJOR part of creating not only the story but the characters and expressions etc.I liked the art style which Brown employed, liked. I didn't really like or love the art style, it was just decent. I thought that the colouring and lettering were still very good and the story, whilst nothing revolutionary, was engaging. I didn't feel as though I could connect with or identify the characters quite as well or easily in this issue which meant that whilst, if this had been a Cowes-illustrated book it still may have only got a 4*s overall, I just cannot give this more than a 3.5*s which is so sad after just HOW MUCH I adored the ending of issue 11.Overall I'd say that the artist has clearly got talent and her own style which is nice, but it's not the same and it doesn't work nearly as well for me in this context. I hope that the future few artists do a little better or hook me into the story a bit more as I don't want to have a disappointing Volume overall with all the Guest Artists, but I have to say I am looking forward to issue 14 which is apparently hinted to be rather revolutionary somehow and not have a guest artist? We shall see, overall this one gets a 3.5*s
