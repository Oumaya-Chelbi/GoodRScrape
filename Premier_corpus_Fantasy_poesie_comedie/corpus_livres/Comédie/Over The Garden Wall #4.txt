3.5 / 5Pros- The art style is evocative of the show, and continues its visual aesthetic- The story fits in well with the "Over the Garden Wall" universe, and dovetails with the showCons- The work is very short, coming in at only 24 pages (with extra content, like sheet music)- These comics take place between the episodes of the miniseries (though this one is a prequel of sorts), and little character growth is possible as a result. As the comic series has gone on, it has become increasingly clear to me that these comics would be hard to enjoy without the context of the show.- One of the strengths of the show was its ability to convey a variety of tones and emotions (happiness, sadness, danger, horror, and more). This comic is definitely the most grounded and darkest of the four (compared to the other three comics' more whimsical tone), but it still misses the tone of the show. It's hard to be mad about this, given the length constraints at play, but the work can't avoid drawing comparison to its source material. After all, it is taking place in the same universe, features the same characters, and is written by the same people.ConclusionOver the Garden Wallfans will almost assuredly enjoy this work, as it's more of their beloved characters in wacky situations. Folks who haven't watched the show may not be as dazzled by the work, and honestly, can probably pass on it.
