The Wicked + The Divine is BACK to its former glory. I loved everything about this issue: the action-packed plot, finally seeing Persephone in action - as expected, she's badass -, the tone it's setting for this arc, the developments it's foreshadowing, the pomegranates (!!!!!!), the gorgeous art we've come to miss during the Commercial suicide arc, this ending (talk about a cliffhanger), errrr'thang I'm telling you.I might be biased though because Persephone/Proserpina has always been my favorite divine figure, all myths considered.I can't wait to see which direction they will take with that Destroyer persona, and what exactly it entails.On a totally different note, Minerva's parents physically make me sick.Also, even if I enjoyed that plot "twist", I'm kinda mad that Baphomet cheated on Morri. I mean, he's already a murderous asshole, does he really need to cheat on the only great thing in his life to top it all off?Moreover, Ananke knowing about this one night stand strikes me as odd. Considering they can't reach the underworld Gods when they're underground, it's quaint & convoluted that she'd know of something that presumably happened underground.I'm very intrigued by that machine Ananke has Woden build, and what its purpose is.My baby Ananke is as cryptic & dodgy as ever, I'm love it.But as the plot moves further, there's almost a shift in paradigm and I'm wondering if Ananke's the evil character that she's been portrayed as in Commercial suicide.I guess we'll have to wait & see. I'm so excited for what is to come next!
