Gillen and McKelvie’s stylish cover of Scott Pilgrim. And the reason they can get away with a cover which, for large chunks, appears totally irrelevant to the story they’ve been telling so far, is that they understand why the original works and don’t just slavishly replicate it but cover it in their own style. It’s still about constructing your identity round bands and thematically ties in to the main Emily story, but it’s from the perspective of characters from The Singles Club arc instead. Your enjoyment for it may depend on your tolerance of conceptual hi-jinks; but if you’ve made it this far into the series it’s likely to be high enough to go with the flow. You know what you’re getting from the series by this point.Oh, and as Gillen says in the notes, Laura is deeply, tragically wrong about Couples. But wrong in exactly the way people were at the time.
