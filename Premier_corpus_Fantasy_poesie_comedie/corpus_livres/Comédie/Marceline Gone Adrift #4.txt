In 'Marceline Gone Adrift' well renowned singer and Vampire Queen Marceline has lost her creative buzz. In a sudden and unusual catastrophe Marceline is blasted out into space. Princess Bubblegum embarks on a mission to save her and leaves the Candy Kingdom to slowly fall apart in her absence. A heartwarming story about love, friendship and creativity this is a must-read for all Adventure Time fans.I really enjoyed reading 'Marceline Gone Adrift'; I'm a big fan of the Marceline and Princess Bubblegum pairing so any comics that go further into their story are a big yes from me. The story is split into chapters which makes it easier to read in short chunks and a lot easier to put down when you need to. I did have slight issue with the narration of the story; it's split into the povs of different characters which can make reading it fairly confusing at times as it's tricky to keep track of everyone's story and remember the events that have just happened for them. However, I did find this a thoroughly enjoyable read.I would recommend a previous knowledge of Adventure Time/Marceline and Princess Bubblegum if you're intending to read this comic.
