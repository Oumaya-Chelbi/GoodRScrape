I grew up watching Gundam Wing as a kid so this anime and manga holds a special place in my heart! Definitely something long time anime/manga fans should consider adding to their collection. So with that said, as much as I love GW this new manga remake could be better.There is a new generation of fans who have never seen or heard of GW and I would LOVE to introduce them, but I don't believe this manga is good enough as it's too short and fast paced; it feels rushed! As much as I love the character Duo, and not trying minimize him, I was surprised at how much focus was on him and not on Heero and then secondly Relena who are...you know...Kinda important.It just quickly glosses over how Heero and Relena meet and doesn't show anything about these two, which is DUMB. You don't really see Heero trying to blend in as a student or Relena's birthday party. You see a watered down flashback- yes, a flashback- of her inviting Heero to her party and his classic response, but it's cheap. Even with Duo, the manga cuts from the present and then does a flashback as to why he's here and how then jumps back to the present. Why couldn't this story just be more linear?Even so, I have committed myself to owning this series as I have been thinking about it since it was first released and because I still love Gundam Wing. It makes a great companion to the anime.
