I didn't give the book format much thought until now, but I realize that this tall, thin hardcover format is very European; I am most familiar with this size of book from Tintin or Lucky Luke. The author and publisher are British. I think this helps the books to stand out in North America amongst a sea of graphic novels.The subject matter in this entry continues to get more serious, setting this apart from a mere children's book. I think of it as an all-ages graphic series. The characters struggle with living in a new environment after the loss of their home in the prior book. The mother's emotional reactions to Hilda are very genuine; as I parent, I completely understood it when she snapped at Hilda with "Because I said so!", and the intense fear that she had when Hilda may have been lost. The group of children that Hilda encounters show callousness and cruelty; this sets Hilda apart. I adored when, on her turn to play Nicky-Nine-Doors/Knock-Knock-Ginger/Ding-Dong-Ditch or whatever you may call it, she just stands there and has a pleasant and kindly interaction with the woman who answers.This book does not spend much time on it, but there is a significant moment that highlights the main thrust of the series: the trolls.Overall, we see that even in town, this world is full of fantastic creatures and adventure. May we all keep an open heart like Hilda.
