Oh I liked this. It was dark and gruesome and everything I want from a graphic novel.“Being a Witcher’s like a curse. Well, Almost. By nature we have very few friends. Friends we never take lightly. But sometimes even with friendship...enough is enough. And you just have to walk away.”So begins the mysterious story of The Witcher, who befriends a traveller named Jakob after saving him from a Drowner demon. They travel onwards together through dark and sinister lands while Jakob tells the Witcher that his wife, Marta, was murdered nine years ago by Bruxae vampires and was turned into one herself. She has haunted him ever since. In their travels, they come upon a cursed house known as the House of Glass, where Jakob’s dead wife has been spotted.I have not read The Witcher by Andrzej Sapkowski, seen the TV series The Hexer, or played the video games (I know, what is wrong with me?) and I completely understood what was going on and didn’t feel like I was missing any information or back story.At first I was a bit upset that The Witcher would nothelp Jacok’s wife, Marta, avenge her death by killing Jacok, who we later find out murdered her and is a liar. But when she got her own revenge and used the Hag to kill Jacok I was happy that The Witcher let her get her revenge on her own. I feel like her soul would be more settled that way and the Hag was a truly scary monster.I also enjoyed the sketchbook at the end, which showed the design progression for the cover and various scenes, as well as lithography/sketches from Duncan Fegredo and Stan Sakai. The art style was extremely well done and engaging.|Featherbrained Books Blog|Twitter|
