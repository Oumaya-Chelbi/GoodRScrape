3.5 / 5Pros- The art style is evocative of the show, and continues its visual aesthetic- The story fits in well with the "Over the Garden Wall" universe, and dovetails into a plot beat of the showCons- The work is very short, coming in at only 24 pages (with extra content, like sheet music)- Folks who haven't watched the show may be better served by watching it first. It isn't strictly necessary, but it may provide additional context for the relationships and interactions between the characters.- Just like before, I'm still worried that a slavish adherence to the plot beats of the show may render these comics unable to produce something truly new and interesting for readers to enjoy. After all, did we need the backstory of Fred the Horse?ConclusionJust like before,Over the Garden Wallfans will almost assuredly enjoy this work, as it's more of their beloved characters in wacky situations. Folks who haven't watched the show may not be as dazzled by the work, and honestly, can probably pass on it.
