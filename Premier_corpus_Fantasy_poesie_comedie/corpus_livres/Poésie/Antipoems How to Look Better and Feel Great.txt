Is this guy really still alive at 102? That's what the internet says.Chilean poet Nicanor Parra was considered by Roberto Bolano to be the "best living Spanish-language poet," and his many admirers on both sides of the Equator have included Neruda, Mistral, William Carlos Williams, Ferlinghetti, Ginsberg, and Merwin. According to biographer Frank MacShane, Parra's career as a mathematician and physicist may have influenced his poetry in the following ways: (1) his study of the theory of relativity made him hyperaware of the importance of a person's subjectivity and positionality in interpreting events, (2) he preferred to focus on real-world topics, (3) his no-frills writing style was not entirely dissimilar to that in which mathematical theorems are expressed, and (4) his ongoing connection to a world beyond the literary academe may have been one of the factors motivating him to write poetry aimed at readers who do not usually read poetry. MacShane also seems to insinuate that Parra's experiences growing up with an alcoholic guitarist father may have turned him against the use of florid musicality in poetry, perhaps having a hand in leading him to develop his characteristically spare writing style.This is a selection of Parra's poems dated between 1955 and 1985, presented bilingually (the English translations alongside the Spanish originals, which is the only way I can seem to read Spanish-language poetry nowadays). The earliest poems, those of Parra's groundbreaking collectionPoemas y antipoemas, have long stanzas comprised of long lines, suffused with that kind of sneering irony that seems so rare in U.S. poetry and which I've therefore come to associate with the French. Parra's "Advertencia al lector" nods at Baudelaire's "Au lecteur" (of "mon semblable, mon frere" fame), while his "Recuerdos de juventud" recalls Rimbaud's "Les poetes de sept ans." Parra's "Conversacion galante" is explicitly in conversation with Verlaine's "Colloque sentimental" and Laforgue's "Pierrots." Parra's line "But why rake deeper into this wretched affair?" would fit well into Baudelaire's oeuvre, purpled as it is by sordidness and ennui (but also, perhaps, presagesAndrew Wiles's "I think I'll stop here"?).This is an irony that directs its sneer both outward and inward, conjuring a snake that eats its own tail, gets increasingly drunk on its own poison, and then goes off on long-winded (but always winkingly self-aware) tirades while thus intoxicated. Consider, for example, the simultaneously self-mythologizing and self-mocking tone of the passage Merwin translates as: "A soul that has been bottled up for years / In a sort of sexual and intellectual abyss, / Nourishing itself most inadequately through the nose, / Desires to be heard." All the Nietzschean talk of abysses sets us readers up for a self-serious revelation, but then that ludicrous nose image comes along, making us readers realize that nothing here was as serious as it first seemed. On the surface, these poems have an aura of self-loathing Confessional intimacy, and yet on further examination they contain few particulars that would incriminate any individual person, but instead seem to be thinly disguised efforts to sketch the universal.The collection ends with the terser, more aphoristic poems Parra gravitated to in the '80s, soundbite-like jottings that remind me of Jane Hirshfield's concept of "poems of pure statement," such as this untitled gem about mathematician-philosopher Bertrand Russell translated by David Unger:Bertrand Russell was once askedwhat he thought of old ageThe FatherSonand Holy Ghost of Ecology answered:old agejust another stage of lifein which to fight for a just causeHaving been a scientist in the 20th century, a time of many cataclysmic changes and paradigm shifts in science, not least that which was occasioned by the invention of the atomic bomb, Parra is ambivalent about science's contributions to society. In "Soliloquio del individuo [The Individual's Soliloquy]," translated by Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Allen Ginsburg, the narrator -- an archetypical character called "the Individual" who stands in for all of human civilization -- casually narrates the ethically suspect, racially violent, ecologically destructive forward march of technological progress over the centuries: "Colored guys [tipos de color] entered the valley, / But I had to keep going, / Had to produce. / Produced science, immutable truths,...." Parra also expresses doubt that science can ever answer the must fundamental existential questions: "They teach us that space doesn't exist // They teach us that time doesn't exist / But all the same / Old age is a fact of life."Parra's frequent flirtation with absurdism, especially as a counterweight or antidote to the classical "bourgeois" world, could be argued to follow logically from the early/mid-20th-century discoveries of quantum physics. For instance, the poem "Mil novecientos treinta [Nineteen-Thirty]," as translated by Miller Williams, grapples with the Heisenbergian idea that there is no such thing as an innocent neutral observer who does not bear some responsibility for what he is "passively" observing:I offer nothing special, I don't develop theoriesI'm only a camera swinging over the desert....I don't understate nor exalt anything.I simply tell what I see....Thousands of Croatian and Slovenian terrorists are executed en masse behind my backI let it happen, I let it passI let the murders go on quietly....Parra's poems have some features that make them, for me personally, less enjoyable than they would otherwise be -- in particular, an ongoing undercurrent of apparent revulsion toward the female (see, for example, the following poems: "El tunel," "La trampa," "Los vicios del mundo moderno," "La vibora," "Las tablas," "Momias," "Conversacion galante," and "El anti-Lazaro," as well as the crassness of the ending of "La cruz"). I can tolerate this quality in literature up to a certain point, but after it's piled too deep and too high, it starts to seem like an unignorably distracting flaw in the writer's psyche, a blind spot that keeps the poems from achieving the heights of wisdom and insight they might otherwise have a shot at. And, when put together with the biographical anecdote about how a young Parra leapt uninvited onto the stage at an event celebrating the Chilean woman writer Gabriela Mistral to read one of his own poems, it just kind of leaves a bad taste in one's mouth. Still, there's a lot to ponder and enjoy here. My favorite poems, besides the Bertrand Russell one, included"El hombre imaginario"and also#20 of the "Sermones y predicas del Cristo de Elqui."
