This is a brilliant story and makes me remember the sheer excitement of exploring the world of exotic animals and the exciting places they lived. The story uses colourful illustrations and a rhythmical storyline which provides a musical and fast paced feel.The story is about a giraffe called Gerald who lives in the African plains of Kenya. The plains are filled with lively animals who just love to dance. Funny illustrations of waltzing warthogs, rock ‘n’ rolling rhinos and tangoing lions gives the story great humour and action. All the animals appear to be exceptional and talented dancers except for poor Gerald who just can’t seem to fit in and dance. As a result Gerald often gets teased by the other animals and after a rather embarrassing and critical moment at the Jungle Dance, Gerald is laughed out of town. With a little reflection and council from a wise old cricket, Gerald is freed from his self doubt with a lively and colourful twist. This message is written in an exciting and rhythmical way enhanced by the beautiful and colourful illustrations.I like this book as it has a positive message to deliver to children about finding your own style but also not to expect others to have the same abilities. It encourages them to be more open minded when they meet new people and enjoy the diversity of the world. Children will be able to identify the various creatures detailed in the book. The characters are loveable and humorous and the book has wonderful creative illustrations that set out the scenes.These books can support literacy by encouraging imagination and development of word language and can also inspire creative games, oral stories and writing in Y1 and lower Y2. The detailed illustrations ensure the story is used as visual aid on an interactive whiteboard. This book would also be appropriate for independent reading for developing readers as it has a variety of words that will extend the children’s vocabulary and interests.
