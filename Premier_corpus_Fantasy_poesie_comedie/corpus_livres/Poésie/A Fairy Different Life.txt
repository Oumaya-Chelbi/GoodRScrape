Find out what happens when the bully becomes the bullied in, "A Fairy Different Life."This story has been read & loved by many children (3+), parents and teachers on numerous occasions. Furthermore, it has been awarded the following five-star Readers' Favorite editorial review by Kristen Van Kampen.A Fairy Different Life by Goob is a rhyming, educational children's book that follows a young girl. The girl is a bully, and she doesn't like the way certain people dress, or how certain people act. She wished everyone would be more like her, and then a fairy appears and grants her wish. Everyone now dressed the same way and acted the same way. A few people start braiding leaves into their hair, but won't include the girl. Then the others started bullying her. She realizes that she isn't perfect, and that it isn't nice to judge others. But how will she get the world back to normal?I really enjoyed A Fairy Different Life by Goob. The book shows young readers that you shouldn't bully, and that life would be horrible if everyone was the same. The book teaches these lessons in a fun and easy to understand way. I liked how the book shows that often people don't like others because they're different. The book also shows that everyone can change for the better. The rhyming is very well done and gives the book a rhythm. The pictures by Regina Land are very well done and depict the scenes very well. The pictures are also very colourful and fun to look at. I liked how there was a pun in the title. The characters are all very relatable, because most people, at one point, have wished that someone was more like them. I would recommend A Fairy Different Life to all young readers.
