This will be the perfect book for my brother to read to his two-and-one-half year old daughter, who loves dinosaurs so much that she can already correctly identify her toy dinosaurs as T-Rex, Triceratops, etc. The book features one-page poems about fourteen different dinosaurs, with bright illustrations of the dinosaur on the facing page. There are some dinosaurs that I've never even heard of, like the Queztalcoatlus (which looks like a Pterodactyl to me).Jack Prelutsky's poetry is rhythmic, funny and informative. Much likeThe Dragons Are Singing Tonight- my personal favorite - the poems inTyrannosaurus Was a Beast: Dinosaur Poemsare full of advanced vocabulary words that perfectly flow with the verse. There are so many great laugh out loud lines in the poems that it is difficult to decide which poem is my favorite. The only thing that could have made the book better was if had been another collaboration with illustratorPeter Sís. WhileArnold Lobel's illustrations are beautiful, they lack the humor and style thatPeter Sísbrings to the table. The best illustration of the book is the cover, where the Tyrannosaurus seems to have a personality - a big smile and bright trickster eyes.
