I’m probably going to be in the minority here but here goes… 3.5 overhyped stars rounded down to 3.She was thatwild thing I lovedmy dark between starsI absolutely loved Love Her Wild, Atticus’s first book. The poems were separated into sections (Love, Her, and Wild) and the poems were placed accordingly. Atticus attempted a similar set up for The Dark Between Stars with varying degrees of success. He started backward with Stars and ended with Dark, which was an interesting choice. In the book’s description it mentioned that themes range from falling in love, being committed, to accepting the nostalgia of being alone again so it makes sense to start with Stars. However, my overwhelming thought throughout the entire book was how disjointed it felt. I had to actively focus on the section to remind myself what exactly I was supposed to be focusing on.Also, one on my favorite things about Love Her Wild was that the vast majority of the poems were very short but very meaningful. I felt that there were many unnecessarily long poems that seemed almost rambling. These poems had an effect on the pacing, which was kind of off-putting.It felt like some parts were more motivational poster than poetry;The truth issometimesyou canbothdo better.Pretty sure I’ve heard this sentiment word for word by no less than 4 people.Despite its shortcomings, I still enjoyed this collection of poems very much. The poems I did like, I loved. And the use of pictures throughout gave a good sense of feelings of wonder and nostalgia to go along with the main themes.Maybe if I didn’t read through the entire thing all in one sitting I might have a different view of the coherency and pacing.
