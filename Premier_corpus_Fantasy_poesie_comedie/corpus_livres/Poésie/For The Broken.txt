"Your brokenness is beautiful not because of the way you are but because of the way you will be when you are finally free."This past few weeks I´m in a place where I can´t seem to read anything.I tried different types of romance, different genres.. I tried to re-read my favourite books of the year, but it seems like nothing really goes through me anymore.So I tried to read poetry, and since "For the Broken" was avaiable on Kindle Unlimited, I decided to give it a shot.At first I really thought this book was about people who were heartbroken, that just got out of a relationship or of a crush that went wrong, and this poem would help them heal and realize that we can stay broken for quite some time, but surely this time is not going to be forever.But, in reality, something that I didn´t realized is that people who are broken are not broken just because of a relationship that went wrong or rejection.People sometimes are broken because society made them feel that way.People sometimes are broken because they can´t seem to fit in any place that they go.People sometimes are broken because the equality that everyone talks about is not there at all."Losing what matters most to you is the beginning of becoming yourself."So, even though I thought a lot of times during my reading that this book was a cheap self-helping kind of thing, it made me realize that brokeness could come in all forms and types. And, even though we think that we can´t seem to move on and this pain is never going to cease, we all have to hope that someday everything is going to be all right and there´s no one but ourselves that are responsible for the hope in our lives that someday we won´t stay broken anymore."It´s hard to heal when your mind has moved on but your heart is stuck in the past."
