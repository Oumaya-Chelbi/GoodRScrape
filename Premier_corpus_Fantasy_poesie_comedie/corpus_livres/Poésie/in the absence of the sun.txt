If I’ve said it once, I’ve said it a thousand times: I just don’t think modern poetry is my thing.2/5 stars.If this type of poetry hits you right in the stomach, awesome! That’s great. I’m truly happy for you. But what happened to the poetry that was so saturated in beautifully strung together metaphors that it was practically dripping off the page? I miss those days. I miss that poetry. If this works for you, that’s wonderful. To each his/her own. Personally I found this entirely underwhelming and I had to force myself to push through this collection. It seems so utterly juvenile, but even middle school me would probably have read these poems and thought they were missing substance and clarity. Once I finish my stack of recently ordered Amazon poetry, I do not think I will be revisiting any modern day poets for awhile. It obviously isn’t for me, and I loathe writing bad reviews. I’m giving this 2/5 stars because frankly I don’t want to give any poet a one star rating. I don’t want writers to feel discouraged to write from the heart, which is exactly what poetry is - it’s a pressure-release valve, a blurry photograph of the soul, a more socially-accepted anti-anxiety medication. NEVER stop writing.
