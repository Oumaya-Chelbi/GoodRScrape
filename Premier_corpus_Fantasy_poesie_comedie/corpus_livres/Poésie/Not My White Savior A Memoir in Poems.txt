I used to think of inter-country adoption in simple terms - “unwanted children” blessed with “better lives” in the West. Then I went to China and learned about some of the coercion if not outright confiscation involved in procuring infants during the country’s adoption boom.Sadly, similar ugliness seems to have happened in Korea. Julayne Lee’s Not My White Savior, a memoir in poems, is about her own adoption into a white Christian family in Minnesota, and how she returned to Korea as an adult and continuously grapples with feelings of loss and alienation. And anger, so much anger. She touches on how the South Korean government failed its children, the lack of support for unwed mothers, the 200,000 infants sent abroad in an industry that lined so many pockets.On a personal level, Lee clearly didn’t have a happy childhood. I have met transracial adoptive parents who are open, communicative and aware their children will have different life experiences - and other parents who are dismissive of their children’s struggles and push the “we saved you” narrative. Lee seems to have been raised by the latter, thus her more pessimistic views of inter-country adoption.Still, whether an adoptee has supportive parents or not, we should be able to acknowledge there is gain AND loss when children are sent far from homelands, and that more than a few birth families were split against their wishes. Some of the best books and articles I’ve read uncovering troubling adoption practices are by white adoptive parents who wanted deeper understanding of how their children came to them. Basically, we need to stop with the “better life” narrative. It reeks of superiority, and people’s lives are far more nuanced.Though I do struggle with poetry, I was riveted by Lee’s story. She is blunt and passionate, and I appreciate having another narrative of the transracial and inter-country adoptee experience.
