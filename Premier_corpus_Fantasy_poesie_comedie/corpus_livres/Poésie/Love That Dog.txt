Sharon Creech's 2001 novel in verseLove that Doghas indeed been a very much unexpectedly wonderful and lovely reading surprise for me (as I have tended to have some reading issues with regard to Creech as an author). For simply but also totally and utterly textually delightfully (and with a subdued but ever present and strongly rendered emotionality), Sharon Creech withLove that Dogsimply but totally delightfully presents how Jack, how the young first person narrator is wonderfully and lastingly inspired by his teacher Miss Stretchberry to not only learn to appreciate poetry as a literary genre but to also then write, to compose his own verses (and this even though at the beginning ofLove that Dog, Jack is shown by Sharon Creech as being pretty much stubbornly resistant to all poetry and that he thinks reading and even more so writing verses something that only girls but not boys tend to do). And with Jack within the pages ofLove that Doglearning what poetry signifies and means, that there are many different types of poetic forms, and using the poets that Miss Stretchberry introduces in class to write adaptations of authors like William Blake, William Carlos Williams, Robert Frost, Valerie Worth, Walter Dean Myers etc. (with the the latter, with Walter Dean Myers even visiting Jack's class),Love that Dogbasically concludes with Jack's erstwhile negative attitude towards poetry having been totally changed to one of positivity (by both Miss Stretchberry's teachings but also and perhaps even more so by his, by Jack's own experiences writing poetry, by adapting the poets being featured in class to and for his own experiences and realising that penning verses is not only something fun and engaging but also something magically and delightfully healing).Furthermore but also really significantly and importantly (and especially regarding the already briefly alluded to assessment of poetry being something therapeutic in nature), inLove that Dog, Sharon Creech also and marvellously demonstrates how with the poems Jack is writing, and which as the story moves along increasingly feature Jack's dog Sky as a subject and as a theme, he is, Jack is able to both come to terms with his dog's recent death (and even to write about how Sky was killed) and also to use his verses as a way to both pay homage to his deceased pet and to also remember Sky fondly and with ever decreasing bitterness. And definitely, even though the thematics of a deceased pet inLove that Dogseems to actually quite bother some readers/reviewers, for me, the story as it is being presented by Sharon Creech inLove that Dogand how Jack experiences healing, poetical joy and being able to remember Sky without too much pain and trauma after writing verses about his dog, in particular for my inner child, this is oh so emotionally heartening and also very much personally relatable (as I did indeed also pen childhood poems when our family dog and one of my favourites of our horses died rather suddenly and that this totally made me feel better and less saddened).Highly recommended and five stars forLove that Dog(with my only and totally minor annoyance being that although I do appreciate the information on poetry in general at the back and the list of the poems/poets being used by Miss Stretchberry, I also kind of wish that Sharon Creech would include those poems within the text proper with footnotes and that she also would include a technical bibliography on poetry as a genre inLove that Dog, although I think that later editions might indeed contain bibliographies).
