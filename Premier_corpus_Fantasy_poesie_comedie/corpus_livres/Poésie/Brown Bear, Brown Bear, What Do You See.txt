I still (and yes, even years later) cannot even remotely fathom that Bill Martin Junior's classic and universally beloved by young childrenBrown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?was actually and in fact categorically banned in 2010 by the State Board of Education in Texas because its (and no, I am not really feeling contrite at all or in any manner guilty about being insulting and denigrating here) obviously woefully lacking in even basic intelligence members (and in particular totally moronic board member Pat Harding, who also made things much much worse and herself look absolutely and utterly ridiculous by repeatedly and vocally trying to justify her sorry self) somehow and in error believed that Bill Martin Junior was the author, was the same Bill Martin of the DePaul University in Chicago, who in 2008 penned an academic textbook calledEthical Marxism: The Categorical Imperative of Liberation(a book I have actually read, and no, it did not turn me into a raging Communist either, Ms. Harding).I mean, banning children's books is bad enough anyhow as well as it being totally undemocratic and dictatorial (read Stalinist, Fascist), but really for those extremist right-wing Texas ignorants who were obviously infesting the State Board of Education like dangerous parasites to ban and to forbidBrown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?from being used and displayed in Texas schools because they were obviously not able to figure out that the author ofBrown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?and the author ofEthical Marxism: The Categorical Imperative of Liberationwere different Bill Martins (and especially since Bill Martin Junior had died in 2004 and the other Bill Martin did not even pen his ethical Marxism book until 2008), this just so totally and painfully shows that the Texas Board of Education's members who insisted onBrown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?being removed from schools are either not able or not willing to adequately research authors or the books they write. And really, how is the Texas Board of Education's 2010 banning ofBrown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?any different from when in the South Africa of apartheid, Anna Sewell's classic horse autobiographyBlack Beautywas banned by government bureaucrats because they thought the novel was about people with darker skins being beautiful (and of course, this could not be accepted in South Africa, and without the bureaucrats even bothering to readBlack Beauty, it was banned and restricted by idiots with clout and power).But then again, perhaps Pat Harding actually did readBrown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?and thought (after noticing the author's name and freaking out in error and terror) that there indeed might be some kind of hidden and insidious left wing propaganda present and ready to hurt young children inBrown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?, to turn them into Communist agitators, that perhaps Eric Carle's illustration of that big red bird signifies Bill Martin Junior's support of Russian Communism, of Leninism and that the yellow duck's colour could be considered as being a positive nod towards China, towards Maoism? I mean, who knows, and while I am of course being majorly tongue in cheek and facetious here, it is indeed pretty darn surprising and woefully painful how many strange reasons for banning books especially book banners in the USA and in staunchly Social Conservative areas do seem to regularly come up with and vehemently support (and democracy, my foot, or rather my ass, since Social Conservatism is far far too often politically Fascist in scope at best and also even quite majorly politically and philosophically akin to Stalinism and Leninism at its extreme, at Social Conservatism's most reactionary and most radical, and that Social Conservatives are actually and generally speaking politically speaking hard core collectivist and radically LEFT WING Stalinists, and yes, I am talking about putrid individuals such as Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, Greg Abbott, Pierre Poli√®vre et al and their moronic and ignorant LEFFTIE supporters).
