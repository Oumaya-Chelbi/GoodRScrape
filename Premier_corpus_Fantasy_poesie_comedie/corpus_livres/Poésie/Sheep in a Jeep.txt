This book first caught my eye because of the red Jeep on the cover, owning a similar jeep I dove head first into this mind boggling 32 page masterpiece thinking it would help with the sheep like noises coming from my jeep. I learned all too quick that this book was well beyond my age when I failed to realize that sheep cannot drive a jeep! The artistic factor in this book is well below sub-par, I think I could have drawn better in an ambien induced coma. I am not sure who the author was trying to insinuate the sheep to be, but they are some sketchy animals! Once they crash their jeep into a heap they try to sell this lemon without providing a Carfax report. This book teaches people to be sly and dishonest. I would recommend this book for anyone who is looking for a career as a crooked car salesmen or a life in prison. I will give this book a 1 star rating for story and illustrations but I will bump it up to a 3 star rating for the picture of the red jeep. (Its a jeep thing!!!)
