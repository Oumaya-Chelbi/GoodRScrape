Years ago I used to work at Barnes and Noble as the Children's Lead. As such, one of my duties was to do story time on Saturday mornings. I cant tell you how many various children's books I read, and I honestly don't remember many reactions. For the most part I read a story and moved on to the next, only noting when one was an utter miss so I didn't read it again.This was the only one that had an extreme enough of a positive reaction that I recall it vividly. I pulled out the book and suddenly some 30 or so children lost their minds and I suddenly felt like a rock star on a stageâ€¦ if the entire fan base was five and under.I picked it up again recently for my daughter, and it is once again repeating. We've read it five nights in a row now, and every time she gets so excited to hear it. If you have a young child in your life, make sure you give this one a try as it seems to be a consistent hit. 4/5 stars
