2.5/5Review first in spanish and then in englishEspañol: me gustó pero a la vez no, es raro.English: I like it but at the same time I did not like it, it's weird.Favs: "Do not be so hard on yourself. Life is rife with struggle you cannot blame yourself for needing rest.""Give your sadness the attention it deserves. Do not run away from confronting your feelings.""Do not fear chaos become the storm and there you will find your power.""You don't need a man to validate who you are.""Trust is a loaded gun that you put into the hands of someone else.""The clouds cover the sun but they are not immortal, they will fade away one day. Just as your struggle will one day just be another chapter in the story of your past.""The greatest secret of life is that we are the product of the mistakes we make. Mistakes shape us into the person we will ultimately become.""To be broken is not the same as giving up you do not need to give up. On the contrary, see this as an opportunity to put yourself back together again into something new.""I swear the power of your soul is infinite."
