A Child's Calendar by John Updike is a children's book in the Poetry genre. This book is fit for elementary students, grades K-5. Updike takes a lyrical approach to the descriptions of the 12 calendar months of the year. Through illustrations and words, the author takes us on a journey of emotions, memories and activities that occur within a family for each month. Reading this book will bring you back to your childhood and each emotion that was felt as you spent your time with your family from month to month.In the classroom (specifically Kindergarten) , this book could be used for the purpose of teaching the calendar months to your students. As we reviewed the months, I would have the students create a collage of different things they associate with each month. Along with the collage, they will need to write one word/phrase/sentence that sums up their feelings about this month. This would fulfill Art standards and Common Core Standards.Another activity this book can be used for is to provide instruction for descriptive language in your writing. A Child's Calendar can be used as a mentor text for helping students apply descriptive language to their writing. As a class, we will read through the text and we will highlight, or point out, words that provide description to what the author is talking about. After we review the students will then apply this descriptiveness to their own poetry. This will fulfill ELA Standards.This is a WOW book for me because the author truly was able to bring me back to my own childhood memories. Each poem for the month I could imagine all the activities I would participate in and each feeling I would feel during that specific month. The author's descriptive and lyrical nature made this book very enjoyable to read. I know my students will enjoy this book and I can't wait to be able to use this in my classroom.
