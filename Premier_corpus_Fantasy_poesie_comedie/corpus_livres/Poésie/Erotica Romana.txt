The epilogue was shocking. I didn't expect something like that from him:...Nor do the girls take offense when they see me--by no means the matrons.None finds me ugly today, though I am monstrously strong.Half a foot long, as reward, your glorious rod (dear poet)Proudly shall strut from your loins, when but your dearest commands,Nor shall your member grow weary until you've enjoyed the full dozenArtful positions the great poet Philainis describes.The prologue, the epilogue the 3rd and the 7th poem weren't published in the first edition released in 1795, because at the time they were considered obscene. Only in 1914 the full cycle of poems was published, using the version Goethe made for the 1800 edition.Some beautiful erotic scenes:From the 3rd poem:What would you give to me more? --You, Nipotina, what yours?Banquets and game tables, operas, balls, promenades down the Corso?These but deprive my sweet boy of his most opportune times.Finery, haughtiness do not entice me. Does one not lift aGown of the finest brocade just as one lifts common wool?If she's to press in comfort a lover against that soft bosom,Doesn't he want her to be free from all brooches and chains?Must not the jewelry, and then the lace and the bustles and whaleboneAll of it come off entire, if he's to learn how she feels?I encounter no troubles like those. Simple dress of rough homespun,At but a lover's mere touch, tumbles in folds to the floor.Quickly he carries the girl as she's clad in chemise of coarse linen--Just as a nursemaid might, playfully up to her bed.Drapings of satin are absent; the mattress is quite unembroidered.Large is this room where the bed offers its comfort for two.Jupiter's welcome to more from his Juno if he can get it;Let any mortal find rest, softer, wherever he can.We are content with Cupid's delights, authentic and naked--And with the exquisite creak /crack of the bed as it rocks.From the 7th poem:Do then I not become wise when I trace with my eye her sweet bosom'sForm, and the line of her hips stroke with my hand? I acquire,As I reflect and compare, my first understanding of marble,See with an eye that feels, feel with a hand that sees.While my beloved, I grant it, deprives me of moments of daylight,She in the nighttime hours gives compensation in full.And we do more than just kiss; we prosecute reasoned discussions(Should she succumb to sleep, that gives me time for my thoughts).In her embrace--it's by no means unusual--I've composed poemsAnd the hexameter's beat gently tapped out on her back,Fingertips counting in time with the sweet rhythmic breath of her slumber.Air from deep in her breast penetrates mine and there burns.Cupid, while stirring the flame in our lamp, no doubt thinks of those days whenFor the triumvirs he similar service performed.From the 23rd poem:Mine is a secret more pleasant, but even more difficult keeping:Out of abundance of heart eagerly speaketh my mouth.None of my ladyfriends dare I confide in, for they would but chide me;Nor any gentleman friend, lest he be rival to me.Rapture proclaim to the grove, to the echoing cliffs perorate it?One can do that if one's young, or if one's lonely enough.I to hexameters tell, in pentameters I will confide it:During the day she was joy, happiness all the night long.Courted by so many suitors, avoided the snares that were set herNow by one bolder than I, now by another in guile,Cleverly, daintily, always slipped past them, and sure of the byways,Comes to her lover's embrace, where he so eagerly waits.Luna! Don't rise yet. She's coming, and must not be seen by the neighbor!Breezes, rustle the leaves: muffle the sound of her feet.And as for you, little poems, o grow and flower, your blossomsCradling themselves in the air, tepid and soft with love's breath.Wafting, betray to Quirites, as Midas' reeds did with cheap gossip,One happy couple in love, and their sweet secret, at last.
