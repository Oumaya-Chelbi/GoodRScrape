"The Llama Who Had No Pajama" is an anthology of 100 favorite poems by Mary Ann Hoberman. The poems really focus on different topics and aspects of learning, such as seasons, animals, rhyme, nature, letters, opposite, etc. I would have really enjoyed this book of children poetry if I didn't sit down in one sitting and read through the whole book all at once. Some of these poems are really serious and they can become a life lesson to children. Children can really connect with this book because all the poem should have similar qualities in their life such as celebrating birthdays, swinging on the swings, and so many more themes. I found the illustrations to be very well done and they will absolutely attract the reader 's attention. An appropriate grade level for this book would be first grade through fourth grade. An activity I could accomplish with children would be easy and fun once I pick one specific poem. For example, if I picked a poem about rhyme, I can make rhyming clip cards. A big image would take up most of the card, such as "bee" followed by a picture of a bee. There would be two-three other words with pictures located on the bottom. For example, "car", "lamb", "key", the child will then take a clothespin and pin it on the image that rhymes with the bee. Another activity I could accomplish with children would be picking the poem about nature. I would take the children on a nature walk and they can pick up acorns, leaves, rocks, etc. Once we arrive back at the classroom we can sort all of the objects and explore and learn about every once the children found interesting.
