In the early 1940s Lenski, who suffered from periodic bouts of ill-health, was told by her doctor that she needed to spend the winter months in a warmer climate than her Connecticut home. As a result, Lenski and her husband Arthur Covey traveled south each fall. Lenski wrote in her autobiography, "On my trips south I saw the real America for the first time. I saw and learned what the word region meant as I witnessed firsthand different ways of life unlike my own. What interested me most was the way children were living" (183).In Journey Into Childhood, Lenski wrote that she was struck by the fact that there were "plenty of books that tell how children live in Alaska, Holland, China, and Mexico, but no books at all telling about the many ways children live here in the United States"Bayou Suzette.Strawberry Girl.Blue Ridge Billy.Judy's Journey.Boom Town Boy.Cotton in My Sack.Texas Tomboy.Prairie School.Corn-Farm Boy.San Francisco Boy.Flood Friday.Houseboat Girl.Coal Camp Girl.Shoo-Fly Girl.To Be a Logger.Deer Valley Girl.
