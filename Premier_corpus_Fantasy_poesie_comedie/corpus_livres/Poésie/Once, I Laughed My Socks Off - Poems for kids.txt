This book has a small collection of poems that are fun and a way to engage kids. The book can help develop kids curiosity and love of poetry by giving them an opportunity to explore poems they can relate too by using their imagination. What I enjoyed about the book is all the imagery is the poems gives. It's easy for a student to be able to picture themselves in some of the poems. My favorite poem in the book is Bingo the Boo. I can imagine every child looking and their room and thinking to themselves "how did it get this way?" It is a situation everyone can relate to, and a fun way to read about a messy room.The book would be great to use with the upper elementary grades (grade 3 and above). This poem book does not come with any pictures. It would be a wonderful way to show how figurative language is used and with different examples of poems in the book. Students can discuss the poems with each other and see different elements of poetry used. Students can also focus on literal and nonliteral elements found in poems and ask big questions like why did the author use these words? Where do poets get their ideas and inspiration. The author of the book has other poetry books as well for students to dive deep into some of the authors work, and write about it. Overall great book.
