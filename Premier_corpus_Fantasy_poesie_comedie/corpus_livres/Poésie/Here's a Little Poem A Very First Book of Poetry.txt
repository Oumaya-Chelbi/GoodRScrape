I know we're not supposed to use this word, but I have to: this book is ADORABLE! I really love children's poetry. I love when it is written from the perspective of a kid, especially when they are talking to their parents. And you know that the poet writing it is not a kid as they write it, they are probably a parent themselves and thinking about their own kid. <3 At first I thought it would be too simplistic, but they are seriously darling. For me, I remember there were certain illustrations of my favorite books which were my favorite. My mom and I had inside jokes about those illustrations. These ones by Polly Dunbar have the potential to be those for other kids! They are quirky and cute. The one on page 39 of the grandpa might be my favorite. The way the kids are so tiny and he looks so content. Also the one of the two little kids on page 71. And the rain on 72 and 74. And page 94. I also like how this physical book is large and the illustrations cover the whole page. It's great for little kids and great for reading aloud so that everybody can see. I would love love love to read this to kids. They'd probably pick out their favorite poem and illustration. They could memorize their favorite poem. That would be a great idea for a kindergarten class. (Favorites: Cat Kisses by Bobbi Katz, Happy Birthday - traditional British street rhyme, Your Birthday Cake by Rosemary Wells, Bananas and Cream by David McCord, Beach Time by Marilyn Singer, April Rain Song by Langston Hughes, Night Bear by Lee Bennett Hopkins, Sleepy Song by Clare Bevan, Silverly by Dennis Lee, No Need to Light a Night-Light by Anonymous, The Early Morning by Hilaire Belloc). I DEFINITELY want to buy this book.
