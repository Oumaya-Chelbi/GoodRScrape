I received this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.I read about 50% and then decided to give this up.Let's talk about the cover and title first. The cover is shady and intriguing, and the tile clearly depicts what the book is meant to be. It is a clear portrayal of the content of the book and it definitely goes along with the cover. It was, in fact, the cover which got me interested in this book.Now for the actual content.Born to Love, Cursed to Feelis a poetry collection by authorSamantha Kingfilled with poems aboutlove, loss, redemption, regret, moving on, etc.Initially, when I started the book, I thought it wasbeautiful. I really enjoyed the poems, and I thought that the writing was mdoern and lovely. The poems were touching, they were well-written and I could even relate to a couple of them.However, then, why did I DNF it? FRom about 40% of the book onwards,it all became tiring.Almost all of the poems I readwere written in the same vein, same tone, and were about the same damn thing. They were all about how this girl has lost her love, and how she's hurting and trying to move on and how this break-up destroyed her. And I found that as the pages kept turning and I went further into the book, I kept disliking it more and more. After a while, it was just the same old things written in new words.I like reading about loss and sad break-ups,but not so much that it becomes depressing and annoying.
