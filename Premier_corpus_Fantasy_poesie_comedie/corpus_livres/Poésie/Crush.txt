This is a grief-stricken, painfully loving, violently obsessive collection that feels like a frantic stream of consciousness, with each poem twining together to create a story in feelings. It’s a bit fragmented at times, lending to the air of desperation. It doesn’t feel as though Siken is composing these words as much as they are flowing out of him uncontrollably and it is a matter of life and death that he gets all the words down. These poems are the grief of a mourning man put into words. They are his shame, his fears, his longing, his loneliness. There is a violence associated with this love because of the circumstances of it and the self-hating that can come with being queer in a time/place that it is not accepted that reminds me quite a bit of the violent thoughts inThese Violent Delights, which I found to be especially prominent in “Wishbone” and “Driving, Not Washing”. There is so much content in these poems, but it all whittles down to Siken’s raw emotions, which overpower the narrative, as his cyclical writing forces us to go round and round with him on this repetitive ride that he is stuck in.Louise Glück writes an incredible forward for this collection and I can’t say it better than her when she said: “That Silken turns life into art seems, in these poems, psychological imperative rather than literary ploy: the poems substitute the repeating cycles of ritual for linear progressive time—in Crush, the bullet enters the body and then returns to the gun. . . the poems are driven by what they deny; their ferocity attests to the depth of their terror, their resourcefulness to the intractability of the enemy's presence."Below, I’ve copied down some excerpts and full poems that I really love. My favorite poem, and possibly my new favorite poem(?) was ”Litany in Which Certain Things Are Crossed Out”; my favorite parts are excerpted here, becauseboy, is it a bit long.favorites:[excerpts from] “Litany in Which Certain Things Are Crossed Out”Every Morning the maple leaves.Every morning another chapter where the hero shiftsfrom one foot to the other. Every morning the same bigand little words all spelling out desire, all spelling outYou will be alone always and then you will die.So maybe I wanted to give you something more than a catalogof non-definitive acts,something other than desperation.. . .I can already tell you think I’m the dragon,that would be so like me, but I’m not. I’m not the dragon,I'm not the princess either.Who am I? I'm just a writer. I write things down.I walk through your dreams and invent the future. Sure,I sink the boat of love, but that comes later. And yes, I swallowglass, but that comes later.. . .Okay, so I’m the dragon. Big deal.You still get to be the hero.You get magic gloves! A fish that talks! You get eyes like flashlights!What more do you want?I make you pancakes, I take you hunting, I talk to you as if you��rereally there.Are you there, sweetheart? Do you know me? Is this microphone live?Let me do it right for once,for the record, let me make a thing of cream and stars that becomes,you know the story, simply heaven.. . .You see, I take the parts that I remember and stitch them back togetherto make a creature that will do what I sayor love me back.. . .Here is the repeated image of the lover destroyed.Crossed out.Clumsy hands in a dark room. Crossed out. There is somethingunderneath the floorboards.Crossed out. And here is the tabernaclereconstructed.Here is the part where everyone was happy all the time and we were allforgiven,even though we didn't deserve it.. . .You said I could have anything I wanted, but Ijust couldn’t say it out loud.Actually, you saidLove, for you,is larger than the usual romantic love. It’s like a religion. It’sterrifying. No onewill ever want to sleep with you.. . .Build me a city and call it Jerusalem. Build me another and call itJerusalem.We have come back from Jerusalem where we found notwhat we sought, so do it over, give me another version,. . .Forget the dragon,leave the gun on the table, this has nothing to do with happiness.Let’s jump ahead to the moment of epiphany,in gold light, as the camera pans to wherethe action is,lakeside and backlit, and it all falls into from, close enough to seethe blue rings of my eyes as I saysomething ugly.I never liked that ending either. More love streaming out the wrong way,and I don’t want to be the kind that saysthe wrong way.But it doesn’t work, these erasures, these constant refolding of the pleats.. . .[excerpt from] “A Primer for the Small Weird Loves”1The blond boy in the red trunks is holding your head underwaterbecause he is trying to kill you,and you deserve it, you do, and you know this,and you are ready to die in this swimming poolbecause you wanted to touch his hands and lips and this meansyour life is over anyway.You’re in the eighth grade. You know these things.You know how to ride a dirt bike, and you know how to dolong division,and you know that a boy who likes boys is a dead boy, unlesshe keeps his mouth shut, which is what youdidn’t do,because you are weak and hollow and it doesn’t matter anymore.“Driving, Not Wishing”It starts with bloodshed, always bloodshed, always the samerunning from something larger than yourselfstory,shoving money into the jaws of a suitcase, cutting your hairwith a steak knife at a rest stop,and you’re off, you’re on the run, a fugitive driving away fromsomething shameful and half remembered.They’re hurling their bodies down the freewayto the smell of gasoline,which is the sound of a voice saying I told you so.Yes, you did dear.Every story has its chapter in the desert, the long slide from the kingdomto kingdom through the wilderness,where you learn things, where you’re left to your own devices.Henry’s driving,and Theodore’s bleeding shotgun into the upholstery.It’s a road movie,a double-feature, two boys striking out across America, while desire,like a monster, crawls up out of the lakewith all of us watching, with all of us wondering if these two boys willfind a way to figure it out.Here is the black box, the shut eye,the bullet pearling in his living skin. This boy, half-destroyed,screamingDrive into that tree, drive off the embankment.Henry, make something happen.But angels are pouring out of the farmland, angels are swarmingover the grassland,Angels rising from their little dens, arms swinging, wings aflutter,dropping their white-hot bombs of love.We are not dirty, he keeps saying. We are not dirty. . .They want you to love the whole damn world but you won’t,you want it all narrowed down to one fleshy man in the bath,who knows what to do with his body, with his hands.It should follow,you know this, like the panels of a comic strip,we should be belted in, but you still can’t get beyond your skin,and they’re trying to drive you into the ground, to see if anythingwalks away.[excerpt from] “You Are Jeff”22You’re in a car with a beautiful boy, and he won’t tell you that he lovesyou, but he loves you. And you feel like you’ve done something terri-ble, like robbed a liquor store, or swallowed pills, or shoveled yourselfa grave in the dirt, and you’re tired. You’re in a car with a beautiful boy,and you’re trying not to tell him that you love him, and you’re trying tochoke down the feeling, and you’re trembling, but he reaches over andhe touches you, like a prayer for which no words exist, and you feel yourheart taking root in your body, like you’ve discovered something youdon’t even have a name for.[excerpts from] “Snow and Dirty Rain”. . .… My dragonfly,my black-eyed fire, the knives in the kitchen are singingfor blood, but we are the crossroads, my little outlaw,and this is the map of my heart, the landscapeafter cruelty which is, of course, a garden, which isa tenderness, which is a room, a lover sayingHold metight, it’s getting cold.We have not touched the stars,nor are we forgiven, which brings us backto the hero’s shoulders and a gentleness that comes,not from the absence of violence,but despite the abundance of it…. . .… I’ll give you my heart to make a placefor it to happen, evidence of a love that transcends hunger.Is that too much to expect? That I would name the starsfor you? That I would take you there? …. . .… I would like to meet you allin Heaven. But there’s a litany of dreams that happenssomewhere in the middle…. . .… Moonlight making crosseson your body, and me putting my mouth on every one.We have been very brave, we have wanted to knowthe worst, wanted the curtain to be lifted from our eyes.. . .The way you slam your body into mine reminds meI’m alive, but monsters are always hungry, darling,and they’re only a few steps behind you, findingthe flaw, the poor weld, the place where we weren’tstitched up quite right, the place they could almostslip right through if the skin wasn’t trying tokeep them out, to keep them here, on the other sideof the theater where the curtain keeps rising.. . .… I madethis place for you. A place for you to love me.. . .… We were in the gold room where everyonefinally gets what they want, so I saidWhat do youwant, sweetheart?and you saidKiss me. Here I amleaving you clues, I am singing now while Romeburns. We are all just trying to be holy. My applejack,my silent night, just mash your lips against me.We are all going forward. None of us are going back.4.5/5
