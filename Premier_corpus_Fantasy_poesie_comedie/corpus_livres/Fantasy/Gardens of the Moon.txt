Update: This review is still my correct opinion, however having just finished book 3 I would thoroughly recommend reading until that point (end of book 3) before making a call as to whether the series is "for you" or not.Final Rating: 3.9/5🌕🌕🌕🌕🌑A grand opening book, that that left me stuck somewhere between "what the heck is going on?" and "Oh my goodness... this is freaken EPIC... I think?"What a journey! From beginnings that had me exclaiming "ouch my brain", to a truly EPIC conclusion, Gardens of the Moon is a wild, thrilling rollercoaster of a read... at least once you get past the first half that is... Prepare to be flung headfirst into the depths of the complex Malazan universe, navigating through intricate politics, a mysterious magic system, and a sprawling cast of unforgettable characters.... all while most assuredly NOT having your hand held by Erickson.... because hand holding is for chumps! Chumps I say!... Love it or hate it, for me this is a book that has only left me only craving more. So dive in, but be warned - this is not a journey for the faint of heart!Plot SummaryIn Gardens of the Moon, the first book in Steven Erikson's Malazan Book of the Fallen series, we follow a diverse cast of characters, including soldiers, mages, assassins, and gods, as they navigate the complex world of the Malazan Empire and its ongoing conquest of the Free Cities on the continent of Genabackis. Set against a backdrop of political intrigue, epic battles, and magical confrontations, the narrative delves into the intricate power struggles between the ruthless Malazan Empire, the Free Cities, and enigmatic, god-like beings known as Ascendants, all vying for dominance in a world steeped in ancient history, arcane magic, and hidden secrets.“Ambition is not a dirty word. Piss on compromise. Go for the throat.”World Building: 5/5If there is anywhere where the book really shines, its the incredibly in-depth world that opens before you as you read!Erikson's world-building in Gardens of the Moon totally blew me away, pulling me into this incredibly crafted universe. The main setting is Genabackis, a continent filled with diverse landscapes and cultures. This world is packed with ancient races, like the Tiste Andii, T'lan Imass, and Jaghut, living alongside humans and adding to the complexity of the Malazan universe. The magic system, called Warrens, brings even more depth with its mysterious rules and elemental powers that influence both mages and the world itself.But where Erikson really hits his stride is how he weaves intricate politics and power struggles between the powers that be - i.e the Malazan Empire and the Free Cities of Genabackis. Erikson expertly details everything from Empress Laseen's ruthless plans to the enigmatic motives of the Ascendants, gods mingling with mortals. The political intrigue was just as gripping as the epic battles and magical showdowns. I also really liked how Erikson unveils the world's history and lore through the characters' eyes, letting me gradually immerse myself in the Malazan world and discover its wonders.“Every decision you make can change the world. The best life is the one the gods don't notice. You want to live free, boy, live quietly.""I want to be a soldier. A hero.""You'll grow out of it.”Plot: 3/5This was a tale of two halves.Second half Ira: "The plot unfolded with a captivating blend of political intrigue, epic battles, and magical confrontations. The narrative followed a diverse cast of characters, including soldiers, mages, assassins, and gods, as they navigated the complex world of the Malazan Empire and its conquest of the Free Cities of Genabackis. As the plot progressed, the various storylines began to intertwine just amazingly, creating a rich tapestry that drew me deeper and deeper into the conflict. Because I knew so little of the world, each new unexpected twist and turn left me exclaiming out loud "no way!" - I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE a good twist! Indeed, the way Erikson wove together multiple plotlines was nothing short of masterful."However.....First half Ira: "Man oh man, this book completely threw me for a loop with its steep learning curve and initial confusion. Erikson just chucks you into this complex world full of loads of characters, intricate politics, and a completely new magic system. This made it pretty tough for me to get into the story, at least at first. Furthermore, the confusion only got worse because he really didn't "hold my hand" (his words) or explain things outright. It was left to me to piece together the world and its history through context clues and character interactions. While I can see that this approach eventually led to a greater sense of discovery and immersion, it also demanded a lot of patience and persistence from me as a reader."Honestly, reading Gardens of the Moon reminded me a lot of trying to read Shakespeare plays in high school english class - plays with an in-built commentary to tell you in plain english what the heck is going on.... If instead of "in-built commentary" you mean "Malazan Reddit pages", "Malazan wiki pages", or the "Malazan reading guide on the TOR website". By regularly translating (especially the first half of) the book with these commentaries, I was able to get a better grip on what was happening, which ultimately made the story EPIC. But, let's be real, it's kind of a pain having to read a commentary while you're just trying to enjoy a book in your downtime.“Too many regrets. Lost chances—and with each one passing the less human we all became, and the deeper into the nightmare of power we all sank.”Characters: 3.5/5I loved some of the main characters in this book! Anomander Rake, Rallick, Quick Ben, Tattersail, and Kruppe - all awesome, and that's just me naming a few! I cannot wait to see where their stories end up heading. Indeed, given how confusing the plot was at times, I was flawed at how Erikson managed to make characters that are still so deep and complex. They had genuine emotions, strengths, and weaknesses, which made them feel real and helped me connect with them. Plus, seeing many of their individual journeys and growth throughout the story was pretty satisfying.With that being said though, not all characters in this book are created equally. That is primarily because there are just SO many characters. In all honesty, I found it to be a little overwhelming, making it tough to keep track of everyone (again I had to reference reddit here, "who was that again?") and form a strong connection with each of them. To make things worse, a lot of characters had multiple names or titles, which added to the confusion. I think another issue is that, because of the novel's complex plot, some characters didn't get as much development or "page time" as others. This left me feeling a bit unsatisfied with certain character arcs. And, of course, the initial confusion with the world-building and plot didn't help when you're trying to appreciate the characters' personalities and motivations.“Convergence,” Tool said. “Power ever draws other power.”Writing Style: 4/5On the positive side, Erikson's prose is rich with description and intricate detail, creating vivid imagery that transported me into the world of the Malazan Empire. I found his use of language to often be poetic and sophisticated, lending a sense of gravitas to the narrative. Moreover, he has a knack for crafting gripping action sequences, making the epic battles and magical confrontations truly come to life on the page. A particular highlight was the sense of grimness and darkness that his writing lent to the world.However, his writing style also has its challenges. I found his penchant for complexity really made the narrative difficult to follow at times, particularly for someone like me who is new to the Malazan universe. Additionally, as I have already mentioned the lack of exposition in favor of revealing information through context and character interactions I found to be both incredibly intriguing (aka twists and discoveries) and frustrating (aka confusing as heck).“High house shadow, and a knife in the dark. A new game's begun, or the old one's just turned.”Enjoyment: 4/5My experience with Gardens of the Moon was a bit of a mixed bag. As someone who is very much a "Malazan noob", and having normal expectations for what a fantasy book completely dashed to pieces, in many places I found a lot of this book to be, quite simply, a slog. I really struggled with the steep learning curve, the sheer number of characters, and the complexity of the world.But, here's the thing: no matter how much of a slog something is, I believe it can almost always be redeemed if it nails the ending. And this book NAILED the ending! The way all the plot lines and arcs came together at the end was downright EPIC. It was so satisfying that I'm tempted to go back and read it all again right now, just to catch all the things I missed.So, did I enjoy it? Absolutely! And I'm genuinely looking forward to the "better" books waiting for me in the series. But would I recommend it to everyone? No way! This book is clearly not for everyone. If you decide to dive into it, just be prepared for the challenges that come with the territory.Final Rating: 3.9/5🌕🌕🌕🌕🌑My favourite books of 2023 in preferential order🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕:1.The Shadow of the Gods-(My Review)2.The Grace of Kings-(My Review)3.The Lies of Locke Lamora4.The Forgetting Moon-(My Review)5.Memories of Ice-(My Review)6.The Justice of Kings-(My Review)7.Kings of the Wyld-(My Review)🌕🌕🌕🌕🌗:8.Morning Star-(My Review)9.The Blade Itself-(My Review)10.Tress of the Emerald Sea-(My Review)11.Red Seas Under Red Skies-(My Review)12.The Escape Artist: The Man Who Broke Out of Auschwitz to Warn the World13.Empire of the Vampire-(My Review)14.Assassin's Apprentice-(My Review)15.Malice-(My Review)16.Golden Son🌕🌕🌕🌕🌑:17.Leviathan Wakes-(My Review)18.The Winter King-(My Review)19.Of Blood and Fire-(My Review)20.Gardens of the Moon-(My Review)🌕🌕🌕🌗🌑:21.Deadhouse Gates-(My Review)🌕🌕🌕🌑🌑:22.The Song of Achilles-(My Review)23.Red Sister-(My Review)24.The Frugal Wizard’s Handbook for Surviving Medieval England-Babel: An Arcane History-(My Review)
