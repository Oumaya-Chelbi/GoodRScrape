∞/5 ★’s⁀➷❝a dragon without its rider is a tragedy. a rider without their dragon is dead.❞welcome to the fourth wing 🐉°❀⋆.ೃ࿔*:･･:*.ೃ࿔⋆❀°𝓼𝓹𝓸𝓲𝓵𝓮𝓻 𝓯𝓻𝓮𝓮 𝓹𝓸𝓻𝓽𝓲𝓸𝓷what is more than infinity stars? i’ll tell you what. it’s this book. besties let me just start with saying…i am a romance/dark romance girly through and through. the only other fantasy books i’ve ever read were the acotar books and that series was so good. easily one of my favorite series ever, but fourth wing? it was even better…literal chefs kiss🤌i was hooked from the very first sentence to the very last. i’ve read one of rebecca’s romance books and i loved it, but her writing fantasy?! she ate that up and left zero crumbs. this is easily one of my top reads of 2023. fourth wing was action packed and the romance was amazing.❥ 𝓉𝓇𝑜𝓅𝑒𝓈:⤷ found family⤷ enemies to lovers⤷ slow burn⤷ touch her and you die⤷ morally grey mmc⤷ forced proximity❥ 𝒶𝑒𝓈𝓉𝒽𝑒𝓉𝒾𝒸:⤷ dragons⤷ academic setting⤷ divergent vibes⤷ dystopian fantasy❥ 𝓅𝓁𝑜𝓉 𝓈𝓊𝓂𝓂𝒶𝓇𝓎:this book is about violet sorrengail, the daughter of a high ranked general. most of her life she was practicing/training to be apart of the scribe quadrant because of her love for books and her intelligence, but her mother told her that she must follow in her siblings footsteps and become a dragon rider. violet is in no way prepared for that, but she ends up going to basgiath war college to do exactly what her mother asked of her. to become a dragon rider, you must pass all these very deadly challenges that are designed to kill off the weak. while violet is trying her very best to become a dragon rider…she‘s constantly fighting her attraction for xaden riorson (her enemy that she was told to stay away from). xaden is a well respected wingleader of the fourth wing and his one goal was to kill violet because of the family she belongs to, but what happens when her life suddenly becomes tethered to his?❥ 𝓂𝓎 𝓉𝒽𝑜𝓊𝑔𝒽𝓉𝓈:this book was so easy to follow and it was so fast paced. i was a little intimidated because the font was small and the chapters were longer than i usually prefer, but there was not a single page in this book that was boring. i’m usually the type to see how many pages are left in a chapter, but i simply did not care. i was fully consumed by this book and got totally lost in it. the action…it caused me a LOT of anxiety, but i ate that shit up. this book had my heart RACING. there were so many parts in this book that literally took my breath away…had me forgetting how to breathe. the romance!?! ♾️/10. the angst, the spice, the banter…literally everything you want for a romance plot. the writing was absolutely amazing. the descriptive writing omg…10/10. it was so easy to picture all of the different settings and picture everything that was happening. i felt like i was sitting in the front row watching this entire book unfold. this book has so much potential to be turned into a movie omg please😭cast theo james as xaden IMMEDIATELY and then cast me as violet🤭and then let’s just erase dain completely. i adored most of the characters in this book. i love when i fall in love with side characters just as much as main characters.°❀⋆.ೃ࿔*:･･:*.ೃ࿔⋆❀°❥ 𝓋𝒾𝑜𝓁𝑒𝓉 𝓈𝑜𝓇𝓇𝑒𝓃𝑔𝒶𝒾𝓁 (𝓋𝒾𝑜𝓁𝑒𝓃𝒸𝑒):⁀➷❝i am the sky and the power of every storm that has ever been. i am infinite.❞⁀➷❝i will not die today.❞this woman. one of my all time favorite fmc’s who i admire so much. her character development was phenomenal. i swear it was the most satisfying thing about this book. as soon as she was painted to be this tiny, weak, helpless woman…i was impatiently waiting for my girl to prove everyone wrong and she DID that. i love how well she knew her own mind and was not afraid to come forward and speak it. a place like the riders quadrant is where people go and get stripped of their humanity, but i love how violet kept all her morals intact. she knows who she is and y’all she is THAT bitch. the way she had so many people wanting/trying to kill her, but she never lost sight of who she was so when it came to her having a perfect chance to end the lives of those who wanted to end hers…she didn’t want to do it. it’s not her. ahhh i just love her so much.❥ 𝓍𝒶𝒹𝑒𝓃 𝓇𝒾𝑜𝓇𝓈𝑜𝓃 (𝒽𝓊𝓈𝒷𝒶𝓃𝒹):⁀➷❝fascinating. you look all frail and breakable, but you’re a violent little thing, aren’t you?❞immediately theo james. that is who he reminds me of. but then THE FANART!?! was not prepared😩xaden is a man you steer clear from and because he’s that kinda man…sign me and violet the fuck up cuz we’re THERE…on our knees. he’s the type of man that raises your pulse because of fear or lust…there’s no in between. xaden has so many walls up and throughout the book, violet tears those down…one by one. i loved xaden’s character from the start which is crazy to say because he made it very clear that he wanted to kill violet. but just know this…behind every villain is me falling in love with them.⁀➷❝i might be a villain to some, but not you.❞this man could literally run me over with his dragon and i’d still chase after him. i love his leadership and it meant so much more to me after finding out about his past. this man deserves the world. i love how protective he is and how he always challenged violet to do better and get stronger. AND HE’S FUNNY!? he had me giggling, swooning, kicking my feet, BLUSHING. this man may not be real but he gave me real butterflies in my tummy every time he spoke.❥ 𝓇𝑜𝓂𝒶𝓃𝒸𝑒:first things first. the spicy scenes…i’m blushing just thinking about them. they definitely live in my mind rent free. the sexual tension was REAL. the things xaden did for violet throughout this entire fucking book.⤷ he had an entire arsenal of daggers crafted specifically for her.⤷ he designed a saddle for tairn so that she could ride without falling to her death.⤷ he taught her how to defend herself.⤷ he protected her when she needed it.⤷ he had a harness made for andarna that attaches to tairn so she could keep up with them.⤷ he picked violets for her…😩this man is the definition of perfect. idc. i will stand by this man forever. he was one of the very few people who saw violet’s potential. he allowed her to handle herself because he knew that she could. he respected her and he showed it in more ways than one. the way he nicknamed her violence😭🤭⁀➷she exists, and i get turned on.⁀➷i can’t help it. i smile. this brilliant fucking woman is mine.⁀➷❝not all strength is physical, violet.❞this man seriously owns me. like i am SAT. i just love the way violet was told to stay away from xaden because he’s dangerous, but she found the most comfort with him. her trying to resist him and his attractiveness is me af…⁀➷beautiful. fucking. asshole.⁀➷you are not attracted to toxic men, i remind myself, and yet, here i am, getting all attracted.⁀➷toxic. dangerous. wants to kill you. nope, doesn’t matter. my pulse still skitters like a teenager.one of my all time favorite enemies to lovers romance i swear it was so good and written perfectly to me. i love these two endlessly🥹🤭❥ 𝒻𝑜𝓊𝓃𝒹 𝒻𝒶𝓂𝒾𝓁𝓎:i will be talking more about the side characters, but talking about them in depth means spoilers. so let me just say this…rhiannon, aurelie, liam, heaton, sawyer, ridoc, and mira. the love i have for these characters🤭🤭then we have the dragons deigh, andarna, sgaeyl, and tairn. there is nothing i can say about them without completely spoiling a bunch of stuff so just know that the dragons are literally my favorites. they are in charge of everything that has to do with dragons and they’re all different! the excitement i have for the next books to see all these relationships grow. i wanna know more and i’m wondering if rebecca will have some of the books in this series be in some of their povs…but please i seriously wouldn’t mind having three or more books about xaden and violet, kinda like the acotar series!! but just know that there are so many characters in this book to fall in love with hehe.°❀⋆.ೃ࿔*:･･:*.ೃ࿔⋆❀°❥ 𝒻𝒶𝓋𝑜𝓇𝒾𝓉𝑒 𝓈𝒸𝑒𝓃𝑒𝓈:“now, get back to bed before your wingleader realizes you’re out after curfew.”“what?” i gawk after him. “you’re my wingleader!”~this had me giggling🤭“going for blood today, are we, violence?” he whispers. metal hits the mat again and he kicks it past my head and out of my reach. he’s not taking my daggers to use against me; he’s disarming me just to prove he can. my blood boils.“my name is violet.” i seethe.“i think my version fits you better.” he releases my wrist and stands offering me a hand. “we’re not done yet.”~them on the sparring mat for the first time🫠the way he taught her lessons without hurting her.then he guides our hands back to my ribs and slides the ruby-hilted blade back into its sheath. the move is unnervingly…hot.“you’re not going to disarm me?” i challenge as he releases his grip and pushes up more, removing his weight from my body. my ribs expand as i take my full first breath.“nope. defenseless women have never been my type.”~BYEBYEBYEnsync vibesLMAO“did you know that the first time i climbed these steps with dain, i was horrified that there wasn’t a handrail?”“did you know i can’t stand to hear his name on your lips while you’re leading the way to my room.”~the jealousy is hot.“you should end the enemy at your feet.”“i can’t kill an unconscious man.”“he could kill you given the same chance.”“well, that’s a statement on his character. not mine.”~I LOVE VIOLET’S CHARACTER SO MUCH.“have you always been this tall?” i blurt the first thing that comes to mind.“no, i was a child at some point.”~xaden is effortlessly funny.“you’ll have to—““i know how to handle a corset.”~okay so, run me over.“i should have killed him slower.”“i’m fine.” i’m not.“never lie to me.”~🫠pls be mine.“i just need to know what my chances are here.” my hands curl into fists. the ass has the nerve to smile.“that’s the oddest way i’ve ever been hit on—““not my chances with you, you conceited prick!”~THIS HAD ME ROLLING😭😂psa:dain, jack, and all the other loathed characters that i don’t wanna waste time listing…WE DON’T SPEAK OF THEM HERE…unless you’re talking negatively about them. dain is literally tamlin and a redemption arc for him will not be accepted.°❀⋆.ೃ࿔*:･･:*.ೃ࿔⋆❀°𝓼𝓹𝓸𝓲𝓵𝓮𝓻 𝓹𝓸𝓻𝓽𝓲𝓸𝓷❥ 𝓉𝒶𝒾𝓇𝓃 & 𝒶𝓃𝒹𝒶𝓇𝓃𝒶:i was SCREAMING when tairn landed because i just knew he was going to bond with violet, but at the same time i was sad because violet had been protecting andarna so i was rooting for andarna to bond with her and then THEY BOTH BONDED WITH VIOLET. violet is her. when tairn spoke directly into violet’s mind omg i was so excited 😩⤷“i know exactly who and what you are, violet sorrengail.”i just love that one of the strongest dragons chose to bond with violet because of the person that she is omg.⤷“you will not fall. i will not allow it.”the way most dragons let their newly bonded riders fall to their death if they can’t stay on…but tairn put in extra work to keep violet on his back omg🥹tell me that tairn isn’t like violet’s second dad…and overprotective too. their bond is so precious.⤷“i’m proud you’re mine.”andarna is the most precious dragon i swear. finding out that she’s only two years old🥺🥺i love her so fucking much. the power she gave violet to freeze time, but if you use so much of that power, andarna could die. ugh the the way andarna trusted violet with that power. it just really goes to show how well violet carried herself throughout this book. at the end of the book, xaden said got big!! i cannot wait for for the next book.also can we just quick talk about how funny tairn actually was…⤷“you’re bleeding, stop it.”⤷“and to think, i’d almost forgotten just how loquacious humans are.”⤷“you’re making us look bad, stop it.”⤷“now get in the seat and actually hold on this time, or no one is going to believe that i’ve actually chosen you.”⤷”there’s no need to shout. i can hear you just fine. the entire mountain can probably hear you.”⤷“pronunciation could use some work.”⤷“you’re worthy. at least i think you are, but you apparently don’t pay attention in class.”⤷“the closest translation for humans is probably ‘for fuck’s sake.’ now. are you going to stay in your seat this time?”⤷“stubborn silver human.”⤷“you only fell about a dozen times that trip.”⤷“this grumpy ass just caught you a dozen times, silver one.”⤷“and i could call you violence like the wingleader.”⤷ “tell him if he harms you, i’ll scorch the ground where he stands. tell him, or i’ll take it up with cath. word for word, silver one.”⤷“i hear it’s all the fashion.”⤷“should i get the wingleader?”⤷“if they try anything, they’ll be a snack.”imagine having a dragon like tairn…😭❥ 𝓈𝑔𝒶𝑒𝓎𝓁:⤷“they’re a mated pair, tairn and sgaeyl. the strongest bonded pair in centuries.”SCREAMINGGGG! oh xaden…how your plans have changed.⤷“i belong to tairn and andarna…and, in some really fucked up way…xaden.”yes violet, yes you do. i love the way sgaeyl can talk directly into violet’s mind too. usually dragons can only do that to their own riders, but tairn and sgaeyl have such a strong bond🤭so now they’re all a lil family🥹guys xaden and violet being able to speak directly into each others minds. i SCREAMEDDDD. also xaden’s pov for the very last chapter😭i hope the next book has more of his pov!!❥ 𝓉𝒽𝒾𝓈 𝓂𝑜𝓂𝑒𝓃𝓉:“what changed?” frustration tightens my grip on the mug. “when exactly did you decide not to ruin me?”“maybe it was when i saw oren holding a knife to your throat,” he says. “or maybe it was when i realized the bruises on your neck were fingerprints and wanted to kill them all over again just so i could do it slowly. maybe it was the first time i recklessly kissed you or when i realized i’m fucked because i can’t stop thinking about doing more than just kissing you.”can anyone hear me screaming?❥ 𝓇𝒶𝓃𝒹𝑜𝓂 𝓉𝒽𝑜𝓊𝑔𝒽𝓉𝓈violet being able to wield lighting and xaden wields shadows…i love their signets so much!THE BETRAYALS aaaaa i’m so glad rebecca patched things up for the most part between xaden and violet because idk what i would’ve done if THAT was the cliffhanger. now i know i said we don’t speak of dain here but i’m about to drag this bitch through the fucking mud really quick. he was literally supposed to be violet’s best friend. i despise this man, IT SHOULD’VE BEEN HIM AND NOT LIAM. he consistently put violet down and made her feel like she wasn’t good enough to become a dragon rider and then he has the audacity to kiss her and shit and claim that he has feelings for her!? bro what. he’s actually the shittiest person. and then he stole violet’s memory. without her consent. she full on trusted this guy.⤷“i’ve unknowingly betrayed xaden…betrayed them all.”THIS HURT ME OK. violet finding out about xaden’s betrayal, and then dain’s betrayal, and then her feeling as if she betrayed all of them. it was too much.rebecca…listen to me😭the AUDACITY you had to make me fall in love with liam and then brutally rip him away from me. i could not stop crying. i want to cry right now thinking about it. he was such a fun character. he was literally violet’s protector ugh he was so sweet and flirty. i’m so pissed because i thought maybe rebecca was hinting at a little romance between liam and jesinia or am i the only one who thought that??? this is how y’all know i’m such a slut for romance. i just be pairing characters together after one little interaction lmao. but :( ugh it’s gonna take me a little bit to forgive you, rebecca. that death hurt me like no other and then when xaden found out, i cried HARDER.violet’s brother being alive…i cannot stop thinking about the next book. i seriously need it right now. i need to know everything. i’m honestly glad this was the cliffhanger tho because it’s not a devastating one hehe.°❀⋆.ೃ࿔*:･･:*.ೃ࿔⋆❀°𝓼𝓹𝓸𝓲𝓵𝓮𝓻𝓼 𝓸𝓿𝓮𝓻this fantasy book makes me crave more fantasy!
