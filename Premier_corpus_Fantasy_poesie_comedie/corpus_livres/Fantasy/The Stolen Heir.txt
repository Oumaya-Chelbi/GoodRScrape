2nd readNew rating: 4 starsI reread this as a memory boost before reading The Prisoner's Throne, and not only do I remember a lot more now, but I also enjoyed it quite a lot more! The first time I read this I was in a horrible mood, which deeply effected my reading experience, if you can't tell by the atrocious review below, but I am so glad I liked this more!Still mainly reading the next book for Jurdan though<><><><><><><><><>“Another girl might have frozen, but I am cold all the way through.”I already know that this is going to be my most disappointing book of the year. If you know me or have at least seen some of my pre-book updates, you know how obsessive I was over this book, and I was freaking out over every single little detail. I LITERALLY CRIED WHEN I DIDN'T GET THE BOOK IN THE MAIL WHEN I WAS SUPPOSED TO (to be fair, I wasn't in the best place before that and not getting the book just made it even worse).and now I feel like a fool.What may have also impacted my reading experience was that I wasn't going through the best time while reading this, my mental health I guess you could say, wasn't doing good and that greatly affected my experience, pushing me into a reading/mental slump. I'd put it off for a bit and read a few comfort reads, which did help me. I don't think I'm all the way out of the slump, because I have no desire to pick up a book right now, but at least it was enough to finish this book.what also added to the fact was that I ADORED The Folk of the Air, and this was definitely not TFotA. I kept comparing the two books, which I knew I shouldn't have been doing but I couldn't help it. I couldn't get over Jurdan or the world or the plot.And then there was theactualbook that caused me to dislike it.The PlotI think another factor that put me into the slump was the pacing. The beginning of this book just felt really slow- this is a traveling book which I typically have mixed feelings about because I like concrete settings and characters, and it really annoyed me in this one, which led into me having a slump.The things that I did love though were the mentions of Cardan and Jude- those few moments gave me life and I'm so excited to see them in the next book (yes, I am reading the next book because I want to read about Jude and Cardan so badly and I am a little curious about what happens)Thankfully I got back into the book like over halfway through, and the plot began to pick up a little bit, and the middle to end was wild.I'm also unsure how I feel about that ending. I'm kind of mad, because I was hoping it would save the book for me but it didn't. It just made me not like a certain character which is disappointing, because I already feel indifferent to the characters, which is also very disappointing.“It is hard to explain the savagery of hope.”The CharactersI miss Jude and Cardan beyond belief.I cannot picture Oak as a seventeen year old, I literally can't. And please don't remind me about his goat legs. I can excuse the horns, but the goat legs?? I loved Cardan's tail, but goat legs I just cannot imagine. I don't want to imagine them. But anyways, I kind of liked him I guess. He was cute at times, while other times he was really mysterious and you could tell Cardan taught him a few things. I honestly can't even think of a time he annoyed me, nor actually of a time he made me smile. I'd rather have a character who makes me mad than a character I feel nothing towards. GIVE ME CARDAN BACKI am also completely indifferent towards Suren/Wren. She does have a personality, an interesting one at that, but she also annoyed me, which I suppose is better than feeling nothing. The ending especially made me want to scream- she's bloodthirsty sure, but she can NEVER beat Jude. NO ONE beats Jude. I was so angry with her at the end that it literally ruined it for me, which is because I'm an extreme moodreader and let my emotions control me way too much. I must admit though, I felt terrible for her at times. What she had to go through was something no one should ever have to go through.I know nothing about Tiernan or Hyacinthe or whatever their names are, so I don't know what to say about those two.“The Folk adore Cardan, and they’re terrified of my sister, two excellent things. I hope they rule Elfhame for years and then pass it down to one of a dozen offspring. No need for me to be involved.”😭😭 Cardan and Jude >>>>>The RomanceNothing in the entire world will ever beat Cardan and Jude. You're probably thinking "Avery, stop comparing the two, they aren't supposed to be alike!!" and to that I say, I cannot stop myself and I honestly do not care anymore 😊But seriously, I feel like Wren and Oak didn't have much chemistry when they first kissed. Like, I felt no spark, nothing, zero zip nada. I really, really wish I could've loved them because I want to be invested in their relationship, especially after what happened at the end, but I literally cannot if I don't feel the chemistry. They have their cute moments, but I wanted so muchmore.Cardan and Jude were much more developed, mainly because they didn't kiss until much later but in this I couldn't really feel anything, like the flashbacks did nothing for me because I didn't care, which is upsetting.But anyways, I'm going to go cry into oblivion because I feel like a fool and I hate that I disliked this and now writing this out I want to rate the book lower because I realized that I like it much less than I thought I did. I'm so disappointed, especially since it's also my fault for not liking this because of my stupid head and brain, and I honestly hate myself for it.2.8 stars“Sometimes life gives us the terrible gift of our own wishes come true.”<><><><><><><><><>honestly? i'm just glad it's over. and right now, i'm not even sad, i'm annoyed. i'd been hyped up for this book for MONTHS, and here i am, rating it 3 stars, which in my system isn't a high ratingthis book put me into an awful reading slump that caused me to have to read TWO of my favorite rom-coms, not even just one.rtc<><><><><><><><><>Haha guess who lied about the final edit edit: i finally have the book and i'm terrified i'm going to ruin it for myself because i can't get over Jurdan what's wrong with me 😭FINAL EDIT: HAPPY RELEASE DAY AHH. MY BOOK BETTER GET HERE SUPER FAST BECAUSE I WANT TO READ IT SO BADLY. I JUST WANT JURDAN MENTIONS PLEASEEE 🥳🥳 and yes I did stay up until midnight just to type this out right when it's the 3rd.Edit again again: I just read the exclusive first chapter for this and oh my gosh. Also I heard Jurdan doesn't show up till book 2?? I can't wait until the second book ughh. Also I heard something about a Jurdan baby??? Don't take this from me, I've just heard it around. I'm unsure how I feel about it. On one hand, I don't think Cardan and Jude would have a baby. On the other....I wouldn't mind it if they did. I don't know lolEdit edit: did y'all see the quotes that have been posted online?? I'm even more excitedEdit again: I just realized Taryn's kid is gonna be in this.
