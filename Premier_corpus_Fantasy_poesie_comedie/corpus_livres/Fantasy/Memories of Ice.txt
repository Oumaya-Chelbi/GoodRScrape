A true masterpiece of the genre.IfGardens of the Moon(however ambitious)was a sloppy introduction with narrative obstructions that prevented shiny and glossy entry into the series, then duo ofDeadhouse Gateswith its emotional wrestling andMemories of Icewith its flawless execution, were determined in their goal to win you over for eternity.In my opinion, this is Erikson’s best book. And the words I would use to describe it are:perfectly balanced.Sufficiently developed newly introduced characters, engulfed with spry sense of humor - something that will from now on stand as Erikson’s strongest trademark and the main reason why are we falling in love with these characters in the first place(beside their bottomless depth, of course);deep and compelling story, that, while a continuation of the first book, also successfully juggles the parallel story of the second one - all while further progresses in building the world, without actually overwhelming the reader.On the contrary. While it may seem as too long while reading it, by the end of this book, it will compel you wishing for more pages for you to explore.Story.“Forces of nature are indifferent to justice. Thus it fails to us sentient beings, no matter how unworthy, to impose the moral divide.”Link to enlargeLink to enlargeWe’re back on the continent ofGenabackis,land which parts everyone are opportunistically claiming, be that under the banners of conquest or liberation. And as often in real life, as two sides are battling, third one emerges conquering everything before them, unopposed.Atrocities they commit are so vast that two opposing sides now have to join in order to stop them.Although it helps thatHigh Fist Dujek Onearm,leader ofMalazaninvading army, is now turned renegade byEmpress Laseen,which seemingly should help forming a pact with his former foes,Caladan BroodandAnomander Rake.Ha!On their opposing side, far in the south in the land ofPanion Domin,priest turned king -Panion Seerrises armies, armies which includes theTenescowri,a peasant horde, driven by famine, who in their cannibalistic tendencies, leave nothing and no-one to spare.Two sides will meet on the plains before the city ofCapustan,but not before the Tenescowri try to‘resupply’in the city itself.Hence the long siege of Capustan - a thrilling battle of survival - begins.I’ll have to say that, for me, the siege of Capustan, with hundreds of thousands of psychotically murderous cannibals turned warriors- who assail city gates -and just a handful thousands ofGrey Swordmercenaries and brave few citizens- who defend it -is most staggering battle sequence, not just of the book or the series, but in the genre as a whole.Because this isn’t just a battle of people and of their swords on swords and flesh on flesh – this isn’t a battle of violence by its design.This is a battle of humanity. Preserving one.The battle when everything is lost; when your body reacts mechanically and by its memory; when fog of war threatens to blind you to commit same amount of atrocities in the name of perverse justice(or in this case vengeance)– to show a compassion.And most importantly:the battle in you, to find it.But above everything else, this book is about motherhood.Oh yes. Here comes a paragraph or two aboutMhybe.Interestingly enough, same like withFelisin’sstory of her bravery inDeadhouse Gates,book which preceded this one, in all my previous reads, I would never properly focus on a story of Mhybe’s motherhood.I mean, there are battles and conflicts larger than life, characters that veer into dragons, amazing crew of soldiers you want to hang out with and witty wizards you secretly want to become yourself.So, of course, whenever story derails from that cast of characters, I would protest internally.But, maybe, there comes a time when your approach to the same book you have read so many times before slightly changes. You grow as a reader, and along these lines, you are driven by something else; you seek, from that same book, something different.And this is why I think highly and appreciate this series so much. Five, four and three years ago when I was reading this book first, second and third time, I wasn’t even aware that a story about motherhood can be this interesting and this prominent among all these other amazing stories.And the reason that I keep this series so high above everything else in this genre, is that I can come back to it, and after so many reads, still find something that will make this fourth reading experience as new and as emotional as first one.But, I have to say that this isn’t the first time that I noticed the significance of Mhybe in this series.I had a happy childhood and I’m coming from a happy family. I was fortunate enough to be surrounded by a motherly love, and in my close vicinity, all of my friends had a similar experience.So, having a mother who has a love in abundance and was willing to sacrifice herself for her child was a standard. A normal thing. Something that makes you human. Anything less than that was abnormal to me.Right?And then came Mhybe. A character through which I realized that this series goes way deeper than dragons, awesome battles and glorifying deaths. That this series explores parts of human nature we’re not accustomed to, not just exploring, but maybe even understanding.There was a beautiful young girl, full of life, beloved in her tribe, a girl soon to become a woman, eagerly preparing to marry one of many of her suitors.But then, she was chosen to become a vessel; a vessel which through magic would be impregnated with none other than two shattered souls, one beyond death and other held back from it through ancient sorceries, two identities braided together – a vessel that would be used to feed the unnatural child thus created.So, among herRhivitribe, a vessel that would be used as a container for this singular purpose – after which it would be discarded – is called Mhybe.She birthed a child, with no father, a child that came from her womb, but had none of her personality, none of her resemblance, a child she could not call her own.A magical child that, through sorcery, grew too fast, sorcery that demanded power, power found nowhere else than in the strength of the woman who gave this child a life, a life given for a life taken.Taken, but so, so slowly, and through such pain.You see, as this child so unnaturally grew older, so did unnaturally grew her mother.And soon, in a matter of months, as she witnessed her child becoming a 10, then a 15, then a 30 year old, Mhybe exponentially grew older; and she became a young woman trapped in a body of an old person, feeling all the aches of an old age. A girl weathered without the gift of years – old without the wisdom.So, knowing all this, and driven by my own experience I have already mentioned – fully expecting that whatever the case in this story, mother is there to love and support and care and even sacrifice herself for her child – it came as nothing but a complete shock when I read Mhybe saying this:“She has stolen my life!I am naught but bones and leather skin, I am naught but endless aches. Dried brittle – each moment of this terrible existence, and I edge closer to… to…She has stolen my life…”And it shocked me even more that I actually understood her. This mother that resents – no, this mother that actually hates her own child; this abnormal thing for me growing up, given how I was raised and how I viewed the world.I understood her.The fact that Erikson managed to do so, through a character in his book, was enough of a proof how this is on entirely different level than the rest of authors in this genre.And to this day, with all the flaws in this series, and all the love some of the far more lovable series in this genre get, I’m unable to find anywhere else repeating of this exact same thing; wakening of emotions - or at least rising awareness - I didn't know I could have while reading a book.Worldbuilding, History and Lore.As mentioned in reviews for previous books, Gods have an active role in shaping various outcomes.They like to meddle, to pry; they are, as humans tend to be, prone to squabbles, insecurities and vengeance. And not necessarily because there’s abundance of boredom in their Pantheon, no. Most of them are simply vile and vicious creatures. But, since they are all part of Pantheon, there are rules everyone has to abide to.(Or at least everyone who hasn’t found a way to cheat those rules.)The Deck of Dragons.Deck of Dragons is essentially an accurate representation of Pantheon.A kind of structure, imposed on power itself and more importantly, imposition of order.Each card is a gate into aWarren.Before Warrens(realm and source of magic in this world),before magic was refined in elementalPathswhich could be manipulated in current state through those Warrens, there wereHouses.(And even before them there wereHolds.And even before that –WanderingthroughChaos.)And structure of those Houses is something like this:High House represents God’s little realm. And there are multiple High Houses.High House of LifeandHigh House of Death. High House of DarkandHigh House of Lightetc.In those houses structure has its own order. So every House has their rulers,KingsandQueens.They have their loyal subjects such asKnights, Heralds, Priests, Masons, Virgins,etc.Each has their own role in the house and each has their own card in Deck of Dragons.One way to make sure Gods and their loyal subjects behave in borders of their malice or vanity is through Deck of Cards, or throughMaster of the Deck,who can basically make his own rules, who can grant or decline permission to a House’s existence.“Players in the game, wanting no others. Players outside the game and wanting in.Players to the forefront and ones behind, moving in the shadows.Players who play fair, players who cheat.”In this book we are finally introduced toThe Fallen One, The Crippled God.His story is that he’s an alien entity, brought down to the Malazan earth to be shackled. Reasons for that, so far are unknown. We’ll have to trust Gods who are saying that at some point he presented a threat to the world. Yes, those same vicious and vile Gods, yes. I know.So, cyclically, when one Pantheon ceases to exist and a new one arises, they chain him again and again, leaving him in his broken and crippled form.Now, you may ask:“Well, since he’s a God, why isn’t he in a Pantheon with the rest of them?”Good question.It’s a demanding book. And if by chance, by each passing book, it becomes less demanding – it doesn’t necessarily mean that Erikson lost an edge or that he’s trying to make it easier for you.No. It would probably mean that you’re becoming more demanding reader.And he delivers.4.25/5Kharkanas TrilogyForge of DarknessFall of LightPath to Ascendancy seriesDancer's LamentDeadhouse LandingMalazan Empire seriesNight Of KnivesMalazan Book of the Fallen seriesGardens of the MoonDeadhouse GatesUltimate Malazan Chronological Reading Order
