An excellent effort for the author's debut,A pity it gave me so much déjà vu.Final Rating: 3.9/5🌕🌕🌕🌕🌑This book is one part "fantasy's greatest hits compilation", combined with one part "overwhelming levels of déjà vu." Indeed, if this were my first foray into high fantasy, I suspect it would have astounded me, leaving me spellbound in its imaginative embrace. However, the familiarity of its elements – reminiscent of classics like 'The Wheel of Time' for its main characters, the dragon-master bond akin to 'Eragon', and the mythical races straight out of Tolkien's lore – makes me feel that there is likely a glitch in the Matrix (code for: déjà vu). Even the coming-of-age hunt at the beginning echoes 'Faithful & the Fallen', and there is a bit of weaponry that even suggests Sanderson's shard blades are present here too.While many of these great devices are the very reasons I'm drawn to fantasy, their assembly in 'Of Blood and Fire' is akin to a well-known recipe – comforting, yet lacking the thrill of the unexpected. My affection for these tropes kept me engaged, but I couldn't shake off the feeling of treading familiar ground, which occasionally bordered on the mundane. In sum, the book is a homage to the genre's giants, a comforting journey for a fantasy aficionado but perhaps missing a spark of originality to truly set it apart.“I told him that the sun will set, and it will rise again, and it will do so the next day and the next. The gods are in charge of such things, but it is by our own will that we pick ourselves up when we fall.”World Building: 4/5In Cahill's world of Epheria, a land rich with Elves, Dragons, Giants, Humans, and Dwarves, each race and city has a deep history, reminiscent of fantasy greats like 'Lord of The Rings' and 'Wheel of Time'. The magic system piques interest, although it's not revolutionary. Cahill's strength lies in his world-building - the detailed settings and cultures make Epheria feel alive and bursting with untold stories. It's this vivid and well-crafted world that truly captivates and showcases Cahill's talent. While he is a very good job of synthesizing into something fresh, the lack of originality means I really struggle to give it a 5/5.Story Telling: 3.5/5Set in the war-divided land of Epheria, the story unfolds in the humble village of Milltown. Here, three young boys on the cusp of manhood face The Proving, an age-old test of maturity. But their lives take an unexpected turn with the arrival of strangers, catapulting them into a centuries-old conflict.Despite these familiar beginnings, Cahill's storytelling stands on its own. His writing weaves traditional fantasy themes with modern nuances, creating a narrative that's both nostalgic and fresh. It's this blend of old and new – the classic tale of unsuspecting heroes drawn into epic battles, now told with contemporary flair – that makes Cahill's work both comforting and surprising. While this is clearly inspired by previous fantasy greats, it doesn't ever feel like plagiarism. Indeed, it is a testament to how classic fantasy can evolve and I am thoroughly looking forward to the next installment to see if he can take it in fresher directions.Characterisation: 4.5/5Cahill's debut novel is at its best when it comes to character development, a hallmark of classic fantasy, in my view. He has a knack for bringing even minor characters to life, imbuing them with depth and individuality. The story's core, the coming-of-age journey of Calen, Ella, Rist, and Dann, is not just captivating but is laced with suspense, especially since Cahill doesn't hesitate to take risks with his characters' fates. This approach adds a thrilling unpredictability to the narrative. With such a diverse and well-drawn ensemble, I find myself eagerly wondering about the destinies of each character. This level of engagement and anticipation speaks volumes about Cahill's skill in crafting compelling characters and weaving their stories into the fabric of his fantasy world.Enjoyment: 3.5/5In reviewing 'Of Blood and Fire', I found myself in a bit of a fantasy rollercoaster. There were moments that hit all the right notes, feeling like a 'fantasy greatest hits' – those parts I absolutely loved. But then, there were sections I just skimmed through, mainly because they felt too familiar, almost like reruns of what I've already read. The comfort of familiar tropes was nice, but at times, especially in the beginning, it veered towards the mundane.However, the story took a turn for the better as it progressed. The latter half started to carve its own identity, moving away from the well-trodden path, which I found really promising. It's this shift that has piqued my interest for the second book in the series. Having joined the bandwagon a bit late, I'm now genuinely excited and can't wait to dive into the next book – it looks downright awesome from what I've seen! This gradual evolution in the narrative gives me hope that the upcoming installment will align more closely with my taste for unique and engaging fantasy storytelling.Final Rating: 3.9/5🌕🌕🌕🌕🌑My favourite books of 2023 in preferential order🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕:1.The Shadow of the Gods-(My Review)2.The Grace of Kings-(My Review)3.The Lies of Locke Lamora4.The Forgetting Moon-(My Review)5.The Justice of Kings-(My Review)6.Kings of the Wyld-(My Review)🌕🌕🌕🌕🌗:7.Morning Star-(My Review)8.The Blade Itself-(My Review)9.Tress of the Emerald Sea-(My Review)10.Red Seas Under Red Skies-(My Review)11.The Escape Artist: The Man Who Broke Out of Auschwitz to Warn the World12.Empire of the Vampire-(My Review)13.Assassin's Apprentice-(My Review)14.Malice-(My Review)15.Golden Son🌕🌕🌕🌕🌑:16.Leviathan Wakes-(My Review)17.The Winter King-(My Review)18.Of Blood and Fire-(My Review)19.Gardens of the Moon-(My Review)🌕🌕🌕🌗🌑:20.Deadhouse Gates-(My Review)🌕🌕🌕🌑🌑:21.The Song of Achilles-(My Review)22.Red Sister-(My Review)🌕🌕🌑🌑🌑:23.Babel: An Arcane History-(My Review)
