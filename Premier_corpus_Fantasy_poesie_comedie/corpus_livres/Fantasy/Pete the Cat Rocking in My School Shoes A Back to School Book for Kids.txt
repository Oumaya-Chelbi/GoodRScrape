Pete the Cat: Rocking in My School Shoes by Eric Litwin (2011) Illustrated by James DeanJoin Pete the cat as he rocks his school shoes through the classroom, library, lunchroom, playground, and even the bus! Written by author, musician, and song-writer Eric Litwin, the reading of the book evokes a musical tune as Pete’s “rocking his school shoes” refrain is repeated at every location he visits. Beautifully illustrated with paintings by James Dean, the lines, color, and texture transport readers to Pete’s side on his journey through school with his special shoes. The illustrations vary in perspective from wide angles to zoom-in shots as well as multiple collages that allow readers to see just how busy Pete the cat is rocking his school shoes. Text fonts vary in size and color and serve to accentuate the illustrations as well set up a visually easy-to-read storyline. Inside covers of the book display Pete on the bus, and the outside hard-covers of the book reviewed, were colorful and have an eye-catching glossy finish. While this book has the approximate page count typical of a picture book. It is important to note that none of the pages are numbered. This might be problematic with young readers learning numbers and sequences, but it does not detract from the book aesthetically or from a storyline/arc perspective. A fun-to-read book with lively, colorful artwork, and one of the many Pete the Cat books in a large series, this book would make a good addition to any primary school library or kindergarten class.Awards: South Carolina Book Award for Picture Book (2014), Monarch Award (2013)Target Audience: Pre-k to 2nd grade or ages 3-7
