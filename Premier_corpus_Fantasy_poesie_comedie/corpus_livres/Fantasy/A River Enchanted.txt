“From your life came mine. I would not exist if you had been born in the east. I am but a verse inspired by your chorus, and I will follow you until the end, when the isle takes my bones and my name is nothing more than a remembrance on a headstone, next to yours.”🥹🤌🏻You know the feeling when u read something so beautiful that you can’t stop thinking about it. Well yes this book made me feel like this, i went out with my friends today and I couldn’t stop thinking about it. the only thing that was in my mind was that i need to go home to start book 2. my brain refused to think about anything other than this painful ending!! 💔🥲Rebecca Ross 🧎🏻‍♀️🧎🏻‍♀️I was hooked, obsessed, addicted to this book. It was so beautifully, wonderfully, magically written. The book is everything sweet and magical and mysterious. Rebecca Ross writing style has the ability to make me see through the papers. to make me feel like I'm one of the main characters that i was present with them. It’s one of these books that will make you escape and forget reality. I loved it so much 🫶🏻 i want this book to turn into a movie and timothee chalamet to be jack please 😋✋🏻its more fantasy than it is romance so yeah keep that in mind when u read it 🫶🏻“He is afraid of losing you, first in heart, then in body. And if you follow me to the grave, he will not be far behind you. His soul has found its counterpart in yours, and he belongs with you, even after Death’s sting.”characters“I tried to turn myself into stone. To not feel anything. But now I realize that it is better to live, to feel and have a clean break than be half-dead and cold, cracked from resentment.”jackhe’s very brave and thoughtful, considerate and sweet, loyal to his clan even tho they didn’t show him any kindness when he was young, they made him feel so unwanted and unworthy. he plays the harp. His music is his language. I loved his character development and how he finally felt his worth and that he was important 🥹“She had hated him as a lass. But she was coming to learn that it was hard to hate what made her feel the most alive.”adairashe's the leader of the east clan. She's very strong and loyal to her people and to her family. Her character was so we'll written and she was so relatable at times. I loved how she could still see and hope for peace in the darkest times. for some people she might sound so naive but for me she was a dreamer 🫶🏻“It feels strange,” she whispered. “To not know which side I belong to.”“You belong to both,” he replied. “You are the east as you are the west. You are mine as I am yours.”their relationshipi’m not gonna lie. Their banter sounded so bland at first and their romance took a-lot of time to start romancing but i was so found of them at the end 🫶🏻 i loved the way she always called him old menace 🤭 loved that he was the shy one and she was the bold one in the relationship 🫶🏻 it was cute“I want to change. But my bones are old, my heart is selfish, my spirit is weary. I look at me and I look at you, and I see two different dreams. I am death. And you, Sidra …” He reached out to touch her face, softly, as if she might vanish beneath his fingers. “You are life.”Torinugh this man 🧎🏻‍♀️he deserves so much better. He was very kind, sweet and adorable. Very strong and protective of the people of his clan and his family. I loved his character development the most it was so beautifully done 🫶🏻 he’s struggles as a guard of the clan gate was so sad and real. Violence and anger was his language he was raised to be like this to defend his people. But just because you were raised to do and believe in something it doesn’t mean that you have to like it. he was full of guilt and sadness no one saw that in him except sidra 🫶🏻 🫂“There is no failure in love,” she said “And I have loved without measure.”sidrashe’s my favorite character in the book. She’s very kindhearted and cute, she’s so selfless.always looking after everyone🫶🏻 she’s so wise and smart. She’s always see the good in people even if they’re really bad. She’s fearless and honest and loves deeply and she’s not ashamed of that 🫶🏻“Does that mean we cannot exist as one?”“No,” Torin said. “It means that without you, I am nothing.”god i need to be loved like this 😭🫠their relationshipit was my favorite 🥹 they melted and warmed my heart 🥹 no one could understand and see through him like she does and versa vice. She helped him to see things differently. She taught him that violence is not the only way. She was the only one who could claim down the storm and the anger inside him💕 they’re so precious i love then sm 🫶🏻 their sadness and grief made their hearts grow closer to each other 🫶🏻 their povs were my everything🫶🏻Quotes“He couldn’t describe what he felt for her, but it possessed the power to sunder his bones. To lay him open and vulnerable. There were still corners of himself that Torin was ashamed of. He was afraid to fully let her in, to let her see him at his worst, to let her touch the bloodstained palms in his dreams. But then he opened his eyes and beheld her, joined to him. To his present. To his pain and his past. Weaving her fate with his, willingly.”“I’ve made many mistakes in my life,” he began. “But I refuse to let this one get the best of me. I’ve never said this to you, and I didn’t realize how much I desired to speak such truth to you, every sunrise and every sunset, until my voice was taken.” He paused. “I love you, Sidra. My love for you knows no bounds.”“Her hands took the pain for Torin; her voice rose for his lost one.And if she thought that she could measure the depth of her love for him before, she was mistaken.It ran far deeper than she knew.”“I once thought home was simply a place. Four walls to hold you at night while you slept. But I was wrong. It’s people. It’s being with the ones that you love, and maybe even the ones that you hate.” He couldn’t help but smile, watching how his words raced across her skin, making her flush.
