The Name of the Wind,"I tried very hard to like this book. I wanted to like it. Critics liked it. Authors I enjoy liked it. But, try as I might, I did not agree with them.Before I get into what I didn't like, I will take a moment to acknowledge what I thought Rothfuss did well.GOOD STUFF1. The structure of the book was neat: a renowned hero recounting his life and demystifying the stories surrounding him.I like the idea of an adult criticizing the actions and beliefs of his younger self (Jacqueline Carey does this nicely in Kushiel's Dart). And I like the idea of the narrator's story being recorded as he tells it.2. The University setting was fun, even if it did feel too 20th century.I was excited to see a character attend school and slowly gain rank. (Unfortunately, Kvothe was promoted to graduate studies after about three days. Sorry, I'll save that for later; this section is supposed to be for Good Stuff.)3. Elodin was the one character I really liked, even if he was peripheral.He was one of the few that stood out as an individual. Then again, he got Kvothe to jump off a building, which is always a plus in my book.4. While Kvothe was not believable as a child when on the road with his parents or at the University (see Bad Stuff), he was believably young while living in Tarbean.I enjoyed this section of the book the most because it displayed his intelligence and resourcefulness through believable actions.And that's all I have for Good Stuff. Sorry.BAD STUFF1. The gaudy plastic star at the top of this fake Christmas tree of a list of grievances is Kvothe himself.It would be an understatement to say that I did not like his character. I found him unbelievable and derivative and written. I felt no emotional investment in him. At no point in the story did I worry he would make it out okay. At no point did he surprise me.One of my biggest problems with Kvothe was his age. He did not sound or act like a believable child (with the exception of Tarbean, as mentioned.) Moreover, he had to be a genius.Why?I am genuinely asking this. If you have an answer, let me know. So far, I have found no reason for Kvothe to be a child genius. It did not add anything to the story. There was no reason for him to learn so much adult material at age ten other than that it was a convenient time for him to do so. There was no reason for him to enter University at age fifteen other than that it was impressive. He didn't even act like a child or young teen. Why not age him so his thoughts and actions would make sense?Even his perceptions of the world as a child were remarkably adult. For example, his descriptions of his parents focus on what a great couple they were, snippets of their sexual banter, how attractive his mother was, and his hoping that they had a good sex life. These are not the thoughts of a ten-year-old child. Nor were these thoughts filtered in the narration as the reminiscences of Adult Kvothe. Child Kvothe seemed to regard his parents as a romantic couple, rather than mom and dad, who love him but also cramp his style from time to time.Kvothe's dialogue was far too adult and ""witty"" for his age. Show of hands, guys. How many of you gave perfectly polished speeches and witty retorts and spoke in well-received metaphors at age fifteen? I know I didn't. I could have forgiven a lot of this if Kvothe was portrayed as having a quick mouth but an immature mind, but even his moments of pride or stupidity still felt like the actions of an adult.And, of course, he had to be a genius. Advanced medical and magical knowledge at age ten? No problem! He can't afford to pay tuition at University? That's okay, because Kvothe is just so gosh-darned impressive that the school pays him to attend. A teacher attempts to humiliate him in class? Not only does Kvothe teach the teacher a lesson, but he is allowed to skip his entire undergrad education, because he is just that smart. Kvothe participates in the city's most difficult musical challenge that takes talented musicians years to pass? He's so amazing that he succeeds on the first try, and the audience is literally crying at the beauty of his music.Need I go on?Yes, I do, because in addition to Kvothe's never having to struggle with learning something or mastering a concept, there are all sorts of horrible retcons explaining his talents. For example, at one point Kvothe (age ten or eleven) needs to survive alone in the wild for a few months. Ideally, this could be a good learning experience of trial and error, but then we get a few paragraphs explaining that, by the way, one time this dude traveled with Kvothe's family and taught him all about trapping and skinning animals, how to build a shelter, how to start a fire, and what plants are good to eat. And we learn this just a few paragraphs before Kvothe's survival.How convenient.This challenge is no longer a challenge because Kvothe knows exactly what to do.Another example: Kvothe skips town to travel somewhere for plot reasons. He chooses to do this by traveling 70 miles on horseback in one day. (Yes, 70 miles in one day and ononehorse. But that's not even the bad part.) Again, at this point in the story, I thought this could be a good challenge: struggling to ride through the elements, learning how to work with the horse, and facing obstacles along the way. But again, we get a neat aside about how, by the way, Kvothe is a master horseman, because he grew up with horses, and so he knows how to ride and care for them, and how to pick out a good horse for this kind of journey. And again, we learn this about a paragraph before he mounts the horse and rides off.My problem with the above two examples is that Kvothe's ""learned"" skills become tidy deus ex machinas for the situations he has to overcome. Instead of learning how to survive in the wild, we are told that he already knows how to do that, so what was the point of making this a challenge? Instead of struggling to travel 70 miles with or without the constant demands of a horse, we are told that he is good at that too and he succeeds with little difficulty, taking all suspense and interest out of the scene. It would be one thing if, earlier and throughout the story, we saw him snaring rabbits or caring for his parents' horses (a.k.a. demonstrating his skills before they became necessary for the plot). The way these skills were presented felt cheap.(Never mind that, even if he was a master horseman, riding 70 miles in one day would be hell on his body. Particularly after not riding for five years. And Kvothe was ""sore"" the next day? He should not have been able to walk.)Not only is Kvothe a genius and talented at everything, but nothing in his narrative voice suggests that we are listening to the brain of a genius. Nothing in his diction, rhythm, or tone indicates this. I could accept a genius character if his voice reflected an unusual mind, but Kvothe pretty much just sounded like an everyman.I became so tired of Kvothe's perfection, of how impressive and smart he was, of how he breezed past obstacles that could have been character-building. He is one of the clearest examples of a Gary Stu I have ever read.2. I was going to call this category ""portrayal of women,"" but women are not really a part of this story.They exist to give birth (Kvothe's mom), be rescued (Fela), or fawn over Kvothe in wonder (pretty much every woman in the book). The only female character we spend much time with is Denna, so this category is for her.I found Denna to be spectacularly dull. I did not understand what Kvothe saw in her other than that she was hot. Attempts to make her mysterious and intriguing did not work for me. She is a pretty face hopping from man to man for money. (And, supposedly, she's really smart, so why doesn't she go to University too? Or get a job?)The passages devoted to Kvothe and Denna alone together were the most boring parts of the book. For being a couple of fifteen-year-olds, their dialogue was crammed with big metaphors and polished, ""witty"" one-liners.I was going to make suggestions on improving her character, but at this point, I don't care. She could have a dark backstory and I wouldn't care. She could be one of the freaking Chandrian and I wouldn't care. I cannot stress enough how much I didn't care about this character, and that's probably one of the worst things I could say about a work of fiction.3. While I did like the structure of the book (opening in third-person present day, switching to Kvothe's first-person narrative of his past), it did have its problems.Namely, the characters in the present day were poorly developed. I would have liked to know more about Bast and the Chronicler; hell, from their few interactions, I'd like to read a book just about them.Throughout the book, the narrative returns to Bast and the Chronicler. At these points, Kvothe clears up misconceptions and foreshadows later events, which was fun, even if his dialogue was plagued with too many permutations of ""If this was a story, XYZ would happen, but this is not a story."" The narrative usually returned to Bast and the Chronicler after dramatic things were recounted from Kvothe's life, and we saw their reactions.Did Kvothe just tell them something funny? Then Bast and the Chronicler are roaring with laughter. Did Kvothe relay how he did something amazing and clever? Then his listeners are wide-eyed in awe. Did Kvothe reveal something sad? Then they are crying huge tears of sorrow, and the Chronicler is wiping his eyes on the back of his hand, and Bast is croaking, ""I never knew!"" on repeat.The lampshading in this book was pretty bad.I do not like the author telling me how to feel, thanks. If an event in the book is truly sad and written well, then I will touch on my own sad experiences and bond with the characters. But being shown how Kvothe's audience laughed and cried at everything he shared with them felt a lot like watching a sitcom with a laugh track. This was made even worse when Bast would exclaim how sad an event in Kvothe's life was, and then Kvothe would say something along the lines of, ""Yes, it was terrible, but I still did not know real sorrow because even worse was yet to come.""Stop. Readers engage with emotions eagerly. You do not need to tell us how we should be reacting.4. This book felt largely plotless.Yes, it is the first installment of a trilogy and thus an incomplete fraction of Kvothe's life. But a good book can stand alone, even if it is part of a larger work. In a well written and well plotted series, one book will contribute to the overarching plot, but also resolve its own.There was no definable plot here. ""Kvothe grows up in a few different places and goes to school"" is not a plot. ""Kvothe wants to learn the truth about the Chandrian but learns pretty much nothing about them"" is not a plot.Arguably, since this trilogy is a recording of Kvothe's life, it doesn't need a plot. After all, my life doesn't have a definable plot. But I think that argument can only extend so far in fiction. A book is not real life. The story needs to have a shape.Kvothe's accumulation of skills and knowledge did not equip him to handle a major threat at the end of the book. His time at the University did not culminate in a big struggle for him to come out on top of (only minor incidents). He didn't learn much about the Chandrian. We still know nothing about Denna and things between her and Kvothe haven't changed. Kvothe did come to terms with his grief, but that happened about halfway through the book.Moreover, his struggles were mostly comprised of outside forces, such as being poor or bullies being mean to him. With a few exceptions, I did not feel that he grew as a character from overcoming these obstacles. Some of this is due to the aforementioned retcons (by the way, Kvothe is a master horseman, despite us never seeing evidence of this in the previous 500 pages.) And some of this is due to how he overcomes his external obstacles in external ways.Crisis! Kvothe is so poor that he cannot afford room and board at University. Good thing he succeeds at that super difficult music competition on the first try, thus giving him bragging rights and the ability to play for money pretty much anywhere in the city.Crisis! A giant, vegetarian dragon is chasing him down. Good thing Kvothe literally stumbled upon barrels and barrels of a lethal drug to knock the beast out.Crisis! Kvothe is banned from the University Archives. Good thing he happens to meet this weird woman who lives in the underbelly of the school, and who can show him a secret entrance to he Archives.And the like.There's nothingnecessarilywrong with these struggles--except that they happen over and over and over again. Very rarely does Kvothe face problems brought on by his own arrogance/stupidity/etc.; it's just the World hurling problems at him. And I, for one, appreciate characters who have agency--both to get themselves out of trouble, but into more plot. I am even more appreciative of characters who breathe, make mistakes, and change.I did not get this from Kvothe. The Kvothe I met at the start of the book (for either timeline) was the same as the Kvothe I ran away from on the last page. When I stood Beginning Kvothe and Ending Kvothe side by side, I couldn't tell the difference.The character did not have enough agency to shape a gripping plot, and the plot did not shape a gripping character.This book did not have enough of a shape for me.ULTIMATELY...While I did not like this book, at the very least, I can credit it for demonstrating errors to avoid in my own writing.I know a lot of people loved this book, and I would like to know why.

The Lies of Locke Lamora,"”Some day, Locke Lamora,” he said, “some day, you’re going to fuck up so magnificently, so ambitiously, so overwhelmingly that the sky will light up and the moons will spin and the gods themselves will shit comets with glee. And I just hope I’m still around to see it.”“Oh please,” said Locke. “It’ll never happen.”Haha! You gotta love Father Chains for his vivid imagination and if you actually read the entire book you might find yourself at a place where you have to agree with him. XDBut I’m getting ahead of myself here so I’ll just start with my general opinion and will try to take it from there. ;-)This book was amazing! I’m the first to admit that it had a rather slow start and that Scott Lynch put a lot of effort into his world building, the more I read on the more I could understand why he was so thorough with his descriptions though. He set the stage, let us see how Locke’s crew operated, gave us a good understanding about their close bond and offered us a brief glimpse at the machinations behind all their elaborate heists. In short: Lynch wrote a brilliant opening to an intriguing series and I can’t wait to read book two.If there are at least half as many twists and unexpected turns as there were in“The Lies of Locke Lamora”I’ll be a more than just happy camper. *lol* I mean seriously, I loved all those characters and their cunning and deceiving ways. XD Throughout the entire book I never knew what to expect and there were about a ton of“Oh, shit!”moments that were shortly followed by“Jeez! NO!”and“What happened now?”exclamations. I confess that some of the happenings and casual revelations actually left me reeling and I found myself saying: “That’s it! That’s exactly what I want to read!” more often than I can count. And boy did the shit hit the fan at the middle of the book. I barely got a second to breathe and I continued to be breathless until the crescendo ended in a grande finale and the curtain eventually fell.Yes, the second half of the book wasTHATintense. *lol*Anyway, enough of musical terms! Let’s go right to the characters! ;-)The Characters:Welcome to Camorr, the city that harbours questionable characters, morally grey individuals and a wide selection of rich nobles that quite literally beg to be robbed and spoiled. If you’re an innocent and clueless noble you better don’t dwell all too long. You might either end up relieved of the weight of your purse or even worse, you might end up being spoiled for the book! This was a fair warning; the rest is up to you. ;-PFather Chains:”There are only three people in life you can never fool – pawnbrokers, whores, and your mother. Since your mother’s dead, I’ve taken her place. Hence, I’m bullshit-proof.”I really loved that guy! His observations and statements were so funny and accurate and boy was he a clever man. I mean he basically invented “The Gentleman Bastards” and made them the crew they are when we first set eyes on them. He might have been harsh to his boys but it was obvious that he only wanted the best for them and I guess in his own way he really cared about them too. I can’t help but wonder what happened to him though. We only read about him in flashbacks and memories so it’s kind of self-explanatory that he’s dead. How exactly he died was never mentioned though. Maybe this mystery will be solved in book two and we’ll find out more about Sabetha too?? She’s still such a mystery. XDLocke Lamora:”You’re one third bad intentions, one third pure avarice, and one eight sawdust. What’s left, I’ll credit, must be brains.”JThat’s Jean’s description of Locke and to some degree I have to agree with his words. *lol* I think Locke is definitely a whole lot more brains than he gave him credit for though. I really loved this character! He might be a thief but he was a gentleman too and he had his heart at the right place which is the most important thing. For Locke it never was about the money, it was all about the fun he had with his heists and brothers. You might say it was the scheming and plotting that made him happy. To create a plan and to actually execute it in the end. The money they gained from it was just secondary. Locke’s character arc was really intriguing because at the beginning it’s all about the heist and the fun, but the moment the Grey King appears everything changes and gets dark. Well, and after the Grey King took away the only thing he ever cared about his heart and mind are set on vengeance and vengeance alone. I’ve to admit that I loved that angry Locke too and the more I read about his complex character the more I loved him.”If he was going to save them, he had to play the Grey King until the Capa was finished with him, and then he would pray for a quick and easy death. Let Locke Lamora just vanish one night; let his friends slip away to whatever better fate awaited them.””I will have the Grey King, and if all the powers of Camorr and Karthain and Hell itself oppose me, it will be nothing – nothing but a longer trail of corpses between me and your master.”Jean Tannen:”Hell yes,” cried Bug. “I knew there was a reason I let you lead this gang!”“Well, I can’t argue with the manifest wisdom of the boy that jumps off temple roofs. But I trust my points are noted,” said Jean.“Very noted,” said Locke. “Received, recognised, and duly considered with the utmost gravity. Sealed, notarised, and firmly imprinted upon my rational essence.”I loved the bond between Jean and Locke! I don’t know how it happened that they got so close but it was obvious that they are like family to each other. After reading the entire book I have the feeling that I still don’t know Jean all too well but I’m pretty sure Scott Lynch had his reasons to keep his character vague. Maybe we’ll read more about him in the next book and I’d be totally fine with this. Alone the fact that he’s quite literally Locke’s “hatchet man” was enough to make me curious and I truly hope my curiosity will be sated in the next book. =)”I don’t have to fight or run,” he crackled. “I changed the rules of the game. I just have to keep you here … asshole. Here … until … Jean gets back.”The Sanza Twins:”If you do end up in danger, Locke,” said Calo, “you must understand that we will ignore the orders of our garrista, and we’ll bludgeon our friend on the back of his thick skull and smuggle him out of Camorr in a box. I have just the bludgeon for the job.”“And I have a box,” said Galdo. “Been hoping for an excuse to use it for years, really.”Those two were so amazing! They grew on me so fast and then the ending happened and I was likeNOOOOOOO!!!It’s so rare to read about twins in books and I really would have loved to see more of them. Unfortunately it seems like Scott Lynch had other plans and the funny Sanza twins had to disappear. T_T I loved that they would have done everything in order to save Locke and I know he loved them very much. =( I swear I cried real tears when he found them dead at the temple. It broke my heart… They would have deserved so much better than that. Locke was true to his word though, he really made them and Bug the biggest death offering Camorr ever saw and I love him even more for it! <3”And I had to get rid of the moustache in a hurry,” said Locke.“And damned if he didn’t scream when Jean did the honours,” said Calo.“Like a Sanza brother in an empty whorehouse!” Locke made a rude gesture at Calo; Calo mimed aiming and loosing a crossbow at him in return.The Grey King:”But you could have settled for simple theft,” said Locke. “I would have given it all to keep Calo and Galdo and Bug alive. I would have given it all, had you put it to me like that.”“What thief does not fight to hold what he has?”“One that has something better,” said Locke.I really disliked the Grey King and the Bondsmage made my blood boil with anger! They were both such arrogant and self-righteous numpties! I swear when Locke decided to take them down I cheered for him and even though he had to pay a high price for his actions I still think it was worth it. Bug, Calo and Galdo were worth it. I think what shook me the most about the Grey King and his lackey was the simple fact that they just did it because they could. I mean Locke never did them any harm, yet they destroyed his entire life and killed the people he cared about. It was so senseless. The Bondsmage obviously enjoyed to have the power over other people and relished to torture on behalf of the Grey King, so I have absolutely no pity for him. Was it drastic what Locke and Jean did? Yes! Was it wrong? Yes, definitely. Did the Grey King and the Bondsmage deserve it? I’m inclined to say yes, because let’s face it if Locke and Jean wouldn’t have done what they did their lives would have been forfeit the moment the Bondsmage got rid of his shackles. I think they actually didn’t have any other choice if they wanted to survive. >_<The Spider:”I have always found the presumptions of others to be the best possible disguise – haven’t you?”Ha! I knew who the spider was the moment she appeared! It was a clever disguise but not clever enough to fool me. XD I’m just glad that she believed Locke and listened to him and I think they made an interesting pair. What I loved the most about their interactions was their mutual respect though. They could appreciate the skill of each other even though they lived in totally different worlds and were enemies. It was nice to see that Locke’s opponent was as cunning and artful as he was and it gave the story a really nice touch. Whilst the Grey King was all brutality and cruel force in the end, the spider remained conniving and prudent and I really liked that about her.Conclusion:This plane might have taken quite a while until it took off, but boy, did it take off in the end! The more I think about it the more I have to admit that this story was brilliantly executed and I can only take a bow and congratulate Scott Lynch for writing such a complex, detailed and elaborate book! =)____________________________________It’s another month and since March just started I’m once again trying to reduce my TBR with my own blog meme“Hugs’n’kisses OR Dismissed by the Missus/Messrs”.This time around I chose“The Lies of Locke Lamora”and I’m so happy I’m finally going to read this book.I wanted to read it for ages but never had the time and now that I did my monthly blog meme I have no other choice than to go through with it – Which, truth be told, is awesome! *lol*An infamous thief, his morally gray gang and a dangerous and bloody coup?Say no more, because I’m so here for this! ;-P",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29588376-the-lies-of-locke-lamora,The Lies of Locke Lamora.txt
Mistborn: The Final Empire,"I have a Booktube channel now! Subscribe here:https://www.youtube.com/petrikleoHere it is, the beginning of the trilogy that sparked my love for reading fantasy novels.It’s been exactly one year ten months since I first joined Goodreads or started readingThe Final Empirefor the first time; it was on September 1st, 2016. There’s no doubt thatThe Final Empireis an extremely important book for me. It’s not easy for me to elaborate upon this; a cliché such as “I absolutely love this book” is not enough, and the reason behind the significance of this trilogy for me will have to be postponed until I’m done with rereadingThe Hero of Ages. The impact that this trilogy left on my life is immeasurable, and my life before and after I finished this trilogy for the first time is a different one from each other. I predict this will happen within a week or two from now, but for now, let’s talk aboutThe Final Empire, and why—even upon reread—it’s an absolutely incredible start to a trilogy.Picture:The Final Empireby breath-artThe Final Empireis the first book in Brandon Sanderson’s highly acclaimedMistborntrilogy. For a thousand years, the world has been ruled with an iron fist by the immortal emperor: Lord Ruler. The main plot of the book revolves around a rebellion to overthrow the lord ruler; this rebellion is built around a heist led by Kelsier, his team, and his newly found apprentice—Vin. I immensely enjoyed readingThe Final Empire; the first time I read this novel, I found the plot to be thoroughly engaging, relatable, and at times humorous due to the character’s camaraderie and banter. And I was also completely fascinated by the world-building and magic system that Sanderson has created here. On reread, all of these are still true, but there’s a new additional superb quality: all the foreshadowing and hints are now laid bare for me to see with the gift of hindsight.The Final Empire, on its own, works perfectly as a standalone, but trust me that there’s so much more to the story beyond this book. Everything you read here—even the mini details—played major parts in the upcoming sequels.""Plots behind plots, plans behind plans. There was always another secret.”Picture:Kelsier and Vinby GisAlmeidaWhere should I even begin with the wonderful characterizations? I guess I’ll start with Vin. I’ve read more than 200 books since the first time I finished reading this trilogy, and Vin—by the end of the trilogy—still stands strong as one of my favorite heroines of all time. This, of course, doesn’t mean that Vin was the only great character from the series; Kelsier, Sazed, Elend, and many other characters were so memorable as well. I can’t mention them all in this review because their greatness hasn’t occurred yet here. Ever since I read this book for the first time, I’ve heard from several readers that they found Vin to be incredibly emo and annoying; I disagree with this. Vin had a rough past. I think Sanderson did a great job in conveying Vin’s insecurity and emotions. Vin’s thoughts felt believable to me, and I found her character’s development to be amazing. She taught me that despite being betrayed and left behind countless times, it’s always okay—and better—to love and trust someone again rather than being alone. And then Kelsier taught me about the meaning of justice and hope; it’s not okay to stand still in the face of tyranny, oppression, and slavery.“Men rarely see their own actions as unjustified.”Sazed taught me that differences in faith can still lead to being respectful and kind towards each other’s beliefs.“Our belief is often strongest when it should be weakest. That is the nature of hope.”There were plenty of things to learn from the character’s actions in the book. But for now, I want to discuss the next highlight of the novel—and trilogy—itself: the magic system.The Final Empireintroduced us to Allomancy and Feruchemy. Honestly speaking, coming from a gaming and manga/anime background, I thought I would never encounter a magic system as good as the one often told in these two mediums within a novel format. However, I was proven wrong. Allomancy is amazing, and it’s still by far my favorite magic system in the entire fantasy genre. Yes, I think it’s even better than the one shown in Sanderson’s magnum opus—The Stormlight Archive—so far. The intricacy of the magic system that Sanderson has crafted inMistborn Saganever ceased to amaze me, and I’ve yet to encounter a more engaging, complex, and amazingly easy-to-understand magic system in any other fantasy novels. Plus, the actions spawned from the magic system resulted in some incredibly vivid and fast-paced battle sequences.This book was also my first encounter with Sanderson’s spectacular world-building. Accompanied with Sanderson’s accessible, vivid, and immersive prose, the world of Scadrial that’s clouded by ash and surrounded by mist felt extremely atmospheric to read. There was also a lot of well-built mystery and lore within this book; Sanderson used the epigraph at the beginning of each chapter masterfully. I’ve heard a lot of criticisms from several readers that Sanderson’s prose can be a bit too simple to their liking, and I can certainly agree that—not only this book—all of his books contain simplistic prose. However, that’s actually one of the things that I appreciate about his works. His writings never get in the way of the story, and he’s brilliantly capable of telling a story of epic proportion with his accessible writing style. And this doesn’t mean that the narrative is lacking in wisdom or impact. In my opinion, all of Sanderson’s books in theCosmereuniverse contained a lot of relatable wisdom easily applicable to our daily life. A few examples:“The right belief is like a good cloak, I think. If it fits you well, it keeps you warm and safe. The wrong fit however, can suffocate.”or this“You should try not to talk so much, friend. You'll sound far less stupid that way”And with that quote, I realized that it’s time for me to put an end to my review here. It’s safe to say that I still considerThe Final Empireas one of my favorite books and one of my favorite starts to a trilogy. My reread experience of this book has been better than I expected, and I can’t wait to see how the rest of the trilogy will hold up for me. Below here—just for fun, cringe, and nostalgia factors—is the first review I’ve ever written. Hopefully, I did a better job this time! :)You can order the book from:Book Depository (Free shipping)You can findthisand the rest of my reviews atNovel NotionsSpecial thanks to my Patrons onPatreonfor giving me extra support towards my passion for reading and reviewing!My Patrons: Alfred, Alya, Annabeth, Ben, Blaise, Devin, Diana, Dylan, Edward, Ellen, Gary, Hamad, Helen, Jimmy Nutts, Joie, Luis, Lufi, Melinda, Mike, Miracle, Nicholas, Sarah, Seth, Shaad, Summer, Wendy, Zoe.------------------------My first review on Goodreads and I'm really happy it's this book that I chose. The book have an amazing world-building, great characters development and most of all, very intricate magic system and actions. This is coming from someone who've seen plenty of magics (not real of course) from 20 years of gaming and watching anime/movie/television series. The amount of details Sanderson put into each words (not to mention it's really simple and easy to understand) is insane.I will definitely read the rest of the trilogy straight after this and more works by him!",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68428.Mistborn,Mistborn The Final Empire.txt

Let’s begin with what I loved about this book. I’ll start by saying I seriously flipped (or swiped) through this book insanely fast.The Sword of Kaigenis brimming with seductive pacing and it was truly unputdownable. Every moment I wasn’t reading it, I couldn’t stop thinking about what would happen next. From deadly propaganda to non-stop escalating suspense and superb character developments, Wang did a fantastic job in making sure that every chapter has something important happening. No pages were wasted; the book was utterly tension-packed and contained a very endearing cast.“Listen, son… when I was your age, I had to face truths that seemed to break the world. That’s what happens when you come into contact with people who aren’t quite like you. You learn over time that the world isn’t broken. It’s just… got more pieces to it than you thought. They all fit together, just maybe not the way you pictured when you were young.”I’m serious here. I’ve said countless times before that I prioritize characterization over everything else, and a crystal clear talent for characterization has been displayed since the first chapter. The two main characters, Mamoru and Misaki, were extremely well-written; but what amazed me further was how in-depth the characterizations were for EVERY character in this book. The characters are flawed, and none of them stay the same as they were at the beginning of the story.Picture:Mamoruby Tara Spruit (@taratjah)Mamoru’s development in the face of the harsh revelation regarding everything he believed was astounding. Reading about his growth, struggle, and determination in living up to his name (Mamoru is Japanese for ‘protect’) was something I immensely enjoyed. But as much as I loved Mamoru, I have to give my biggest praises to Wang for her stunning achievement in writing Misaki.Picture:Misakiby Tara Spruit (@taratjah)The natural and gradual development in her characterization and relationship with her family compelled me to be heavily invested in her storyline. She has become one of my favorite heroines in fantasy, and I was also thoroughly impressed by the awesome and wholesome female friendship nurtured in this book. The characters in this novel taught me the meaning of facing hardships together, and how crucial family, friendship, love, adulthood, and parenthood are in the face of disaster. These and the terror of war were the main themes ofThe Sword of Kaigen, and they were expertly delivered to the reader with finesse.“I’ve never needed a sword to protect you—to raise you the way your father wanted. Caring for my family meant putting away the fighter, so I did.”The world-building was intricately crafted; the clothing, honorifics, attitudes, older Japanese customs, and languages used were all spot-on. I found the world-building and setting to be quite unique. It’s like an alternate Earth imbued with high fantasy elements rather than a totally new world. Planes and technologies were in the book. The languages that the characters spoke were literally Japanese and Mandarin in our world. I may be wrong here, but the name of the Planet, Duna, may have come from the Indonesian word for ‘planet’: Dunia. Although a different kind of book, this book also serves really well as a rival opposite toThe Poppy Warin world-building. InThe Poppy War, the Nikara Empire (Chinese) was invaded by the Federation of Mugen (Japanese), and the main character there employed fire magic. InThe Sword of Kaigen, the Kaigenese Empire (Japanese) was invaded by the Ranganese (Chinese), and the main character here used water/ice magic. As a Chinese person who devours Japanese culture and media on a daily basis, I’m totally satisfied by the evident amount of research Wang has done for her world-building, and I thank her for it.Picture:Planet Dunaby Charis LokeTo say that this book was thrilling is an understatement. I’m not joking.The Sword of Kaigenis one of the most intense books I’ve ever read. I gritted my teeth, I clenched my fist, and I was constantly breathless. Wang knows how to write catastrophic elemental magic and implement extraordinary heart-hammering scenes very effectively. If you loveThe Poppy War, shonen anime/manga, or elemental magic battles—Avatar: The Last Airbender, for example—you seriously have to read this book. Ice magic, wind magic, blood manipulation, and terrific duels; without writing skills of a certain caliber, the battles in this book could’ve been really frantic and too hard to follow. However, that wasn’t the case with this novel because Wang’s prose was easy and delightful to read. Her prose may not be poetic, but it is vivid, simple, and flows without any obstruction.Picture:The Sword of Kaigenby Felix OrtizFrankly, sometimes it even felt like I was reading Brandon Sanderson’s magical battles, and that’s one of the biggest praises I can ever give to any high fantasy author. Wang provided not only one but two climax sequences inThe Sword of Kaigen; the first one began at approximately 35%, and the second one at the 75% mark of the book. I can say with certainty that both of them were stupendous in quality. Showing the raw and violent power of the magic systems, the calamity that appeared when the bloodline of the gods clashed was bloody destructive. I need to also mention that the book features one of the most memorable duels I’ve ever read in a fantasy novel. Not only was the duel itself magnificent in execution, but it was also so emotionally impactful that it formed unforgettably vivid images in my head.The Sword of Kaigenis a war story, a brutally pulse-pounding one. The great characterizations enhanced the sense of danger and impending loss the characters felt during and after the war. Bad things happen to good people and you WILL feel their palpable pain and tragedy. The piercing blade of ice will stab at your empathy, white snow will turn crimson, the summoning of the Whispering Blade will break your heart, and you will beg for more because you won’t be able to stop reading the book until you’ve reached the satisfying conclusion.“But if I learned one thing from Firebird, it’s that a person’s tragedy doesn’t define them or cancel all the good in their life.”The Sword of Kaigenis an excellent Japanese-inspired military fantasy in all its glory. Written with words sharpened to fatal edges that cut straight to the heart with merciless precision; full of colossal frigid blasts that freeze its suspenseful familial drama and outstanding action scenes into the reader’s memory; emotionally demonstrating the terrifying truth of the atrocity of a devastating war that left incurable scars to the fictional characters who have become real to me. All of these components combined to make this book my first 5—and 6—out of 5-star read of the year. I’m only five days into January at the time of writing this review, and I already know that this superlative book will not only be in my ‘best books of the year’ list by the end of the year but it will also be listed asone of the best books I’ve ever read. In my list of brilliant and favorite self-published books,The Sword of Kaigenstands tall at the top of the mountain, and I honestly have no idea when or if another self-published novel will steal its rightful spot. Without any shred of doubt, this was a phenomenal read, and I will recommend this glistening jewel of a novel to every adult fantasy reader from now on. If you’re a fan ofThe Poppy War, read it. If you’re a fan of military fantasy, read it. If you’re a fan of high fantasy, read it!“Wholeness, she had learned, was not the absence of pain but the ability to hold it.”Sidenote regarding Pre-Order bonus:This pre-order currently is priced at$0.99and ALL entrants (worldwide) who pre-order will receive cool bonus swag.

The Rage of Dragons,"4.5/5 starsThe Rage of Dragonsis a blazing African-inspired epic fantasy debut that was so possessive of my attention, it simply wouldn’t allow me to read anything else until I finished it.This book was originally self-published and released in September 2017. Honestly speaking, I have seen and known about this book since then but the book wasn’t able to move up the monstrosity that is my TBR tower for some reason. However, its acquisition by Orbit, which resulted in a brand new gorgeous cover art done by the ingenious Karla Ortiz, is a total cover seller—look at the Zulu shield and the intricately apt mural in the cover!—that practically screamed “Buy and read me now” to me, and so that’s what I did.“I'd rather live with a thing done poorly than do nothing and always wonder how things could have been.”I believe that the ARC of the book is on its way to me at the moment. Even with that information in mind, knowing that the ebook was already available to purchase (physical copies will be out in July) I bought it to give my support to the author. I was only going to read a few chapters but I ended up being completely hooked and read through it like Sonic the Hedgehog being lured by infinite golden coins; it was too addictive to stop. Let me just say this again before I begin my review. The equation is simple; a fantasy debut published by Orbit these days is for me equal to “I want it.” I haven’t been disappointed at all by the adult fantasy debuts released by Orbit—Kings of the Wyld,Age of Assassins,Jade City,Senlin Ascends, andThe Gutter Prayer—over the past few years andThe Rage of Dragonsonce again continues that trend.“That’s the price. Life is nothing more than moments in time. To achieve greatness, you have to give up those moments. You have to give your life to your goal.”The Rage of Dragonsis an African (Xhosa) inspired epic fantasy debut by Evan Winter, and it is the first installment inThe Burningquartet. The people of Omehi have been caught in an unwinnable war for almost two hundred years, and the story revolves around our main character, the young and gift-less Tau. Tau is determined to just settle down, get married, and live in peace. However, an unfortunate event causes his entire motivation to shift towards the path of vengeance. I really suggest going into this book without knowing about the story, but if you want to know more, the blurb on Goodreads and Amazon is there for you to check out.At its core, the main theme of the novel is revenge. The best comparison I can think of for this book is Pierce Brown’s sci-fi debut,Red Rising. Don’t get me wrong, the prose is totally different in style and there aren’t any sci-fi elements in this book; but the story progression, the injustice in a social hierarchy, the explosive pacing, and the main character truly made me feel like I was readingRed Rising, which I highly loved. As with Darrow—the main character fromRed Rising, I wouldn’t say that I love Tau as the main character, but both Tau and Darrow have this crucial entertaining element for me; they are utterly compelling main characters. Tau is a person with indomitable determination; guided by palpable fury and rage on his road to revenge, his resolve was simply unbending and even though I didn’t really like some of his actions and certain elements of his personality, I found his motivations to be realistically believable and worth reading.“I can't imagine a world where the man holding a sword does not have the last say over the man without one. If you’re not prepared to fight, you place yourself and everything you love beneath the blades of others, praying they choose not to cut. I have felt the mercy of armed men and they will never find me helpless again.""Told mostly from Tau’s third-person perspective narrative, the accessible prose that never gets in the way of the story enhanced the engrossing flow of the book. Although the storyline was a bit predictable, I found the execution and pacing to be absolutely brilliant. There was always something going on; it was fast-paced, incredibly engaging, and brimming with tension. If I have to choose the most outstanding aspect of the book, it would definitely be the battle scenes. It’s been so long since I’ve read a debut with close-quarter battle scenes of the high caliber featured within this novel; it felt like reading Abercrombie’s gritty action sequences. Every battle was easy to follow, gripping, and vivid. The heart-pounding actions never stop escalating until the climax sequences. Believe me, there was a barrage of awesome duels, and I simply can’t get enough of them. Winter combines cinematic scenes and economical characterizations wonderfully. There was never any moment where the characters were just fighting emotionlessly like robots. The brief respites between one danger and the next were very efficiently utilized for characterizations and emphasizing characters’ motivations clearly.“It was the purity of it, the honesty. When Tau sparred, it was just him and his opponent. All that mattered was experience, skill, determination, and will. The rest of the world slipped away, leaving only the next move, the next counter, the next attack, the next victory.The magic system and the demonic aspect of the book were both clever and felt refreshing. I also loved reading every section that involved Isihogo; I’ll leave that for you to find out for yourself. Admittedly, I had one minor issue with the book that prevented me from giving it a full 5 stars rating. I felt the book would’ve benefited from more noteworthy female characters, especially after considering how the female characters in this series have the potential to be extremely powerful and flawed in personality. There were only two noteworthy female characters throughout the whole book and one of them appeared only near the end. That being said, seeing the way the story concluded in the first book, there’s a huge chance the issue I had with the book will be redeemed in the next installment and I highly look forward to it. In the grander scheme of things, my rating speaks for itself and this con only slightly diminish my overall enjoyment of the book.“The days without difficulty are the days you do not improve.”This was my first experience with reading African-inspired epic fantasy and I want more. Evan Winter is another new fantasy voice to watch out for; his voice deserves to be heard and his book deserves to be read. If you’re still on the fence about this, let the flame of the dragons burn that dilemma to ash.The Rage of Dragonsis a breathtaking fantasy debut that triggered tons of adrenaline rush in me. I immensely enjoyed reading it and upon completion, I’m seriously in pain over the fact that the sequel isn’t out yet. The second book is now on my priority list of anticipated books. I highly recommendThe Rage of Dragonsto anyone who loves reading a fast-paced revenge story with great characterizations for the main character. More importantly, if you love reading fantasy with well-written battle scenes, there's a huge chance that this book is for you.Official release date for the physical copies: July 18, 2019 (UK) and July 16, 2019 (US)You can order the book from:Amazon UK|Amazon US|Book Depository (Free shipping)You can findthisand the rest of my reviews atNovel Notions",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41952489-the-rage-of-dragons,The Rage of Dragons.txt
A Time of Dread,"ARC provided by the publisher—Pan Macmillan—in exchange for an honest review.A Time of Dreadis a work conceived in the mind of a genius.Simply amazing and almost impossible to put down, A Time of Dread is truly a masterful start to a trilogy which I envision will be crowned as one of the best series I’ve ever read by its end.John Gwynne has proven himself once again to be the constant harbinger of superlative epic fantasy that only the greatest of authors can achieve.Let it be known that Gwynne is in fact the only author on my list to earn the perfect streak of top quality achievements from me. A Time of Dread marked the fifth time his work has been included in my ‘favorites of all time’ shelves; together with his previous quartet, that’s five out of five books. To do a bit of comparison, neither of my two other favorite authors—Brandon Sanderson and Joe Abercrombie—earned this perfect streak.I can be quite petty with ratings; I don’t give a lot of full five out of five stars ratings. Gwynne, however, never ceased to impress me with his pure and unadulterated talent, and is one of the few authors who always did everything right for my epic fantasy craving.The Faithful and the Fallenis one of the series that I recommend the most often to every fantasy readers I know, whether it’s on Bookstagram, Booktube, Goodreads, or real life; I’m going to keep on doing that, except that starting from now,Of Blood and Bonewill be included.The first book in theOf Blood and Bonetrilogy is a stunning and darker return to the world of the Banished Lands, the same world as his previous series. Creating a new series with a different cast in the same world is risky. The author has to do a lot of things right such as making sure the story will feel different and at the same time, retaining the elements that made his previous work magnificent in the first place; there’s nothing to worry about here because Gwynne achieved all that. Just from looking at the cover, it’s quite obvious there is a huge contrast between Gwynne’s debut, Malice, and A Time of Dread. Where Malice used a white background, A Time of Dread used black; this captured the tone of the book perfectly. Unlike his previous series, the line between good and evil is more blurry here.Hundreds of years have passed since the end of the monumental events that took place in Wrath, now called the Day of Wrath. To save future readers of Gwynne’s previous series from spoilers, all I’ll say is that the main plot of this book mainly revolves around a new upcoming threat that’s coming to the Banished Lands. The book reignites all the sparks that made the previous book excel in quality; betrayal, familial love, the friendship between humans and animals, wars, deception, a few hilarious interactions, and many more. At the same time, like I mentioned before, the storytelling direction is also different. The first chapter, for example, immediately set the darker tone of the entire book which wasn’t found in Malice; even the source of inspiration is different. Here’s an excerpt from the interview I did with Gwynne back in March 2017:“Where the Faithful and the Fallen was inspired by Paradise Lost and Caesar’s Gallic War, this new series is inspired by the Volsung Saga, the Fall of the Roman Empire, Atilla the Hun, the rise of the Orders of the Knights Templar and Knights Hospitaller, and berserker Valkyries.” –John GwynneThe plot is also highly addictive to read. By building the tension with each page turned, the last 20% of the book became one damn fine breathtaking and compelling book to read. Also, for those of you who had trouble with the myriad amount of characters inTFatF, A Time of Dread casts are smaller in quantity, with only four main POV to follow throughout the entire book; Drem, Riv, Bleda, and one side character from the previous series.Speaking of characters: for me, the driving force of a compelling book depends hugely on its characters. If I have to choose, I prioritize marvelous characterization over anything else. Great plot, thrilling actions, and good prose are all almost pointless if I can’t bring myself to care about the fate of the characters in the book.Luckily, one of Gwynne’s greatest qualities as a writer is his stupendous achievement with characterizations.This book strengthens the notion that he’s one of the greatest SFF authors out there when it comes down to writing lovable protagonists and despicable villains. It’s excellent how he always managed to evoke my emotions through the characters' actions and interactions; they felt so real. Do know however that it’s not only the new characters that stole the spotlight in the book; some characters from Gwynne’s previous series do make an appearance here. Whether it’s in the form of their descendants or, in one case, as one of the main POV, I found all the protagonists endearing and the villains despicable. Hundreds of years have passed, so most of our beloved characters have become legendary figures and their names and deeds are mentioned a lot here. If you’re a fan ofTFatF, all the homage paid to those characters is guaranteed to spark a lot of nostalgia.“And so many of them gone, now. But their memory lives on. We shall never forget.”I’ve read a lot of epic fantasy books and I’m confident enough to say without hesitation thatGwynne is one of—if not the—best when it comes to writing grippingly realistic battle scenes.The nock of arrows, the clashing of steel, the explosion of blood, the formation of shield walls; his action scenes have always been very cinematic, intricate, immersive and dynamic, and this book is no exception. In fact, in terms of action, this book and its climax sequences make a lot of other series final book action scenes pale in comparison; Gwynne is miles above the majority of fantasy authors when it comes to close-quarter combat.“Sometimes the only answer is blood and steel.”It’s safe to say that my experience reading this book was enhanced immensely because of my knowledge on the world of the Banished Lands. Realms have come and gone, the state of the world has changed after hundreds of years; there are new factions, new cities, and an altered landscape. However, for longtime fans of Gwynne’s works, familiar names such as Drassil and Starstone Crater are designed to make you feel at home again. Gwynne did a fantastic job improving and reintroducing the established world of the Banished Lands. If you’re like me, not a stranger to this world, it will definitely enrich the already amazing experience of reading this book with the underlying experience we’ve gained. By readingTFatFbefore reading this, you would have lived through the histories talked about in this book. If you’re new to it, you’ll be just reading through them. In conclusion, the world-building is truly a work of excellence because the lore was actually established in full detail from the previous four books. It’s okay for you to read this book without prior knowledge of the world, but do know that it will spoil you on the events of Gwynne’s previous series. It can’t be helped; it’s this book’s history, after all. My advice? ReadTFatFbefore reading this. You definitely should anyway, because it’s one of the best epic fantasy series out there.One of my favorite things about reading something new from one of my favorite authors is seeing how much he has improved as a writer. Gwynne has come a long way since his debut, Malice. His prose is now even better, extremely well polished and top-notch in quality. I found his writing in this book incredibly engaging, vivid, immersive and bloody addictive to read. It was immensely hard for me to put down the book every time I start reading it; and when I did put it down, I couldn’t help reaching for it like I was having withdrawals.The fact that I finished reading this book in less than a day should say enough about how addictive it was.His prose is the glue that connected all the incredible plot, characterization, action sequences, and world-building to become one of the finest first books in a series I’ve ever read.My time in the Banished Lands will always be one of my most treasured memories and experiences in my fantasy literature adventure, and I was beyond pleased to dive back into this world again.TFatFseries has earned its place among my top five favorite series of all time, and Wrath is one of the best books I’ve ever read in my entire life. It’s not an exaggeration to say that it will be extremely hard for Gwynne to create a series that tops my love for his first series. However, I’m anxious to see Gwynne prove me wrong after the amazing things he did with A Time of Dread. Even with my high expectations, A Time of Dread still managed to blow me away; it’s truly a monumental start to a series that’s even better than his debut, Malice, by far. By the end of this book, I was already completely intrigued, hooked, compelled, and eager to read the next book in the trilogy.If you call yourself a fan of heroic or epic fantasy—call it whatever you want—you owe it to yourself to read this book. And IF you’re a fan of Gwynne’s first series, there’s no excuse for you to not read this book. Not only this is one of the greatest start to a series I’ve ever read,Gwynne has truly earned his place among the rank of legendary fantasy authors such as J.R.R. Tolkien, George R.R. Martin, and Brandon Sanderson with what he has achieved with A Time of Dread and his previous series.The waiting game for the next book in the trilogy will be painful, but I know it will be worth the wait. Gwynne hasn’t failed me and I don’t think he ever will at this rate; he’s truly the Bright Star of epic fantasy literature.“Truth and Courage”The official publication date of the book: 11th January 2018 for the UK, and 9th January 2018 for the US.You can order the bookHERE!You can findthisand the rest of my reviews atNovel Notions",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34392663-a-time-of-dread,A Time of Dread.txt
The Grace of Kings,"This debut is super underrated. Ken Liu’s reimagining of the birth of China’s Han Dynasty is nothing short of epic, complex, thrilling, and heartbreaking.“Read a lot of books and try a lot of recipes…When you learn enough about the world, even a blade of grass can be a weapon.”Let’s start with a bit of background. When I look back, I am surprised by how fast time moved. This series has received the same treatment asThe Licanius Trilogyby James Islington, which I've read and loved now. I wanted to read this series to its completion by reading them closer to each other. This way, I can retain all the necessary details, and I have a bigger chance of better reading experience. It is why I postponed reading this series for so long. Even though I knew I would enjoy it based on how much I enjoyed Ken Liu’s collection of short stories:The Paper Menagerie and Other StoriesandThe Hidden Girl and Other Stories. Since 2017, I kept on thinking that the final book of the series will be released the year after, and nope. The fourth and final book of the series kept getting delayed by another year until 2022. Yes,The Dandelion Dynastyby Ken Liu has been in my TBR pile since 2017. I have wanted to start reading this series for five years, and I own the hardcovers of both the US and UK editions of the series so far. And now, I am pleased to sayThe Grace of Kings, Ken Liu's ambitious debut novel, is worth the wait.“A knife is not malicious merely because it is sharp, and a plot is not evil merely because it is effective. All depends on the wielder. The grace of kings is not the same as the morals governing individuals.”The Grace of Kingsis the first book inThe Dandelion Dynastyquartet by Ken Liu. I haven’t read the rest of the series, and things could change starting fromThe Wall of Storms, but it is not far-fetched to callThe Grace of Kingsa historical fiction/fantasy novel. My historical knowledge about the founding of the Han Dynasty or the Chu Han Contention is rusty now, but there’s no disputing that this novel is deeply inspired by it. Honestly, it didn’t dawn on me that Liu replicated the exact events of the Chu Han contention until I was near the end of the book. I went into this book as blind as possible, and after I finished it, I did some research, and Ken Liu admitted several times thatThe Grace of Kingsis an epic fantasy reimagining of the founding of the Han Dynasty and the Chu Han Contention. And I loved it so much. Spanning decades of story,The Grace of Kingsis complex and epic in scope. It depicted brutal results inflicted by the clash of ideals. It displayed the cost and effect of love, friendship, loyalty, betrayals, war, and ambition as raw as possible. And in the attainment of power, the more power you have, the more power corrupts and wields you.“There’s never going to be an end to suffering if ‘he deserves it’ is all the justification people need for inflicting pain.”The main narrative inThe Grace of Kingscenters around two main characters: The Dandelion, Kuni Garu (based on Liu Bang), and Mata Zyndu (based on Xiang Yu), the Crysanthemum. Kuni Garu and Mata Zyndu are two best friends of polar opposites in personality and ideals. While Kuni Garu tends to govern with compassion and intellect, Mata Zyndu governs with honor and overwhelming might. I saw several reviews that accused Ken Liu of plagiarism, and I disagree with this. If this is plagiarism, then every Trojan retelling or reimagining likeThe Song of Achillesby Madeline Miller is, too. Ken Liu has repeatedly said in plenty of interviews that the Chu Han Contention, not sure for the rest of the series, is the source material forThe Grace of Kings. And although several events were replicated, the characterizations, details, and the minimal fantasy elements implemented madeThe Grace of Kingsits own epic/historical fantasy novel.“A lord who knows how to wield men is ten times more fearsome than one who knows only how to wield a sword.”Even though it is true that both Kuni Garu and Mata Zyndu are based on real-life historical figures, one thing differs so much from my experience of reading the actual history textbook andThe Grace of Kings. I enjoyedThe Grace of Kingsimmensely. I felt incredibly invested with the characters. I was thrilled. I was scared. I was shocked. This is not a character-driven fantasy novel, but Ken Liu has successfully imbued emotions into these pages and sparked my attachments to the characters. I personally did not feel a thing reading about Liu Bang and Xiang Yu’s story in a history textbook. It was an entirely different reading experience to read the feats of Kuni Garu and Mata Zyndu. These two are flawed characters trying their best to do what’s right according to their ideals. Kuni Garu seeks to innovate with compassion and forgiveness, and Mata Zyndu insists on sticking to honor and tradition. And it was sorrowful to see how circumstances constantly force them to act according to necessity than to do what's right according to them. Witnessing Kuni Garu’s character development from his carefree and rebellious beginning up to his position of leadership felt so rewarding. His friendship with Mata Zyndu felt genuine, and the ebb and flow in their relationship caused by different philosophies of life never felt forced. On the other hand, the double pupil Mata Zyndu with his weapons, Na-aroenna and Goremaw, inspires loyalty and awe with his insane strength. And it was not only the soldiers who felt awed by his prowess, I was, too.“A man who can kill several people with a sword is merely a living weapon. A great warrior can kill thousands of men with just his mind.”Although I can understand the criticism regarding the lack of female characters, I also cannot help but think this criticism seems overblown. Sure, if you are judging this from the first half of the novel, I can see the accuracy of this statement. But the second half featured many pivotal female characters in a role that decides the outcome of a war. Some of the conflicts in the second half of the novel seriously rely entirely on women taking charge, whether they are generals or not. With Jia, Gin Mazoti, Risana, Soto, Mira, and Kikomi, Ken Liu has crafted strong female characters that don't rely on strengths and physical prowess. If we're going to make comparisons, from the top of my mind, Sanderson'sMistborn trilogyfeature only about four major female characters throughout the entire trilogy; one of them is Vin, the main character. And I rarely—or never—see anyone criticizing the series for the lack of female characters. Why do people criticized Ken Liu'sGrace of Kingsmore heavily and loudly than Sanderson'sMistborn trilogywhenThe Grace of Kingsalone already has more memorable female characters than the entirety ofMistborn trilogy? This is just one example. But whether that’s fair or not, I’ll leave that for you to decide for yourself.“By custom, we wield the sword and wear the armor, but who among you does not know a mother, sister, daughter, friend, who exceeds you in courage and fortitude?So let us no more think of being compared to women as an insult.”I have mentioned the minimal fantastical elements ofThe Grace of Kingsearlier. The story takes place in the fictional Islands of Dara. The three dominating fantastical elements were the existence of airships, the meddling gods, and the creature Cruben. Cruben is a great one-horned scale whale of Dara and sovereign of the seas. It’s 200 feet (61 meters) long, and its size is as large next to an elephant as an elephant would be next to a mouse. These aspects being added to the decades-long story and the shifting alliances caused by the continuous rise and fall of empires made the narrative relentlessly compelling for me. The ruthless tactics employed and the flames of ambition (by both humans and gods) ignited to win the conflicts will be judged by history, and I look forward to judgingThe Grace of Kingsand the rest of the series as one package.“Our lives are too brief to worry about the judgment of others, let alone that of history.”I do have some words of advice for those of you who are interested in readingThe Grace of Kingsfor the first time. First, ignore the naysayers. Second, this is not a friendly novel for those who have just begun reading epic fantasy. It is complex; there are many threads, characters, and names to remember. And lastly, be patient. Unlike many epic fantasy novels, Liu uses a third-person omniscient narration rather than a third-person limited. I did struggle in some sections in the first half of the story. As I said, Kuni Garu and Mata Zyndu are the core of the plot inThe Grace of Kings, but Ken Liu was bold enough to take the risk of introducing and focusing on many supporting characters in the first half of the novel. Sometimes it felt like reading a collection of connecting short stories as we relatively seldom get to see events unfolding from Kuni Garu and Mata Zyndu's perspectives in the first half compared to the second half. However, the convergence and the payoff were utterly satisfying. The second half ofThe Grace of Kingswas simply breathtaking, and I found it difficult to put the book down.“To know the future is to have no choice… to be words fixed on a page by someone else. We can only do what we think is best, trusting that it will all somehow work out.”The Grace of Kingsis one of the most criminally underrated novels I've read. It is underrated in every sense of the word. The novel has been published for seven years, and it currently has 3.7 average ratings out of 14,300 ratings on Goodreads. It is unbelievably underrated and underhyped. I have a principle of second-guessing reviews from reviewers I do not know. And proven time and time again, this time byThe Grace of Kings, I am glad to stand by this principle. I would have missed reading one of the best debuts I've read if I had listened to the negative reviews. This is why I always say, if a book interests you already, ignore the negative reviews (seriously, mine included) and just jump into it whenever you feel like you are in the right mood.The Grace of Kingsdid end in a satisfying standalone manner. But, it also felt like Ken Liu is usingThe Grace of Kingsas a solid foundation for the rest ofThe Dandelion Dynastyto shine. If my praises forThe Grace of Kingsare considered an unpopular opinion, let's just say I am happy to sit and camp in the unpopular bonfire.The Grace of Kingsis superbly crafted, and I've heard from the fans of the series thatThe Wall of Stormsis even better. I will keep my fingers crossed that I am indeed in the presence of a new addition to my ""favorite series of all time"" list. I’ll close this review with a passage from Ken Liu himself:“This is a story very much concerned about all the ways in which every system, however idealistic it may be, tends to have winners and losers and oppressors and the oppressed. The cycle of trying to reach more justice is one that can never end. There is no golden age because we’re always trying to perfect ourselves and yearning towards a future that’s better.”—Ken Liu onThe Grace of KingsYou can order this book from:Blackwells (Free International shipping)You can findthisand the rest of my reviews atNovel Notions| I also have aBooktube channelSpecial thanks to my Patrons onPatreonfor giving me extra support towards my passion for reading and reviewing!My Patrons: Alfred, Andrew, Andrew W, Amanda, Annabeth, Ben, Diana, Dylan, Edward, Elias, Ellen, Ellis, Gary, Hamad, Helen, Jimmy Nutts, Joie, Luis, Lufi, Melinda, Meryl, Mike, Miracle, Neeraja, Nicholas, Oliver, Reno, Samuel, Sarah, Sarah, Scott, Shawna, Xero, Wendy, Wick, Zoe.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18952341-the-grace-of-kings,The Grace of Kings.txt
American Gods,"""Many things prove to me that the gods take part in the affairs of man."" - HerodotusIn Gaiman’s story, the converse is equally true: the very existence of the gods depends on the affairs of mankind, specifically, that people believe in them. Like mortals, they need to be loved.Gods from cultures around the world travelled to the US in the minds of immigrants. The indigenous people already had their own gods, and now (2001) there are new gods as well: internet, capitalism, media etc. In a material, synaptic, digital world, the immaterial, synoptic, analog beings struggle to survive.This fantastic concept is wrapped up in a disorienting road trip through the wonders of small town USA. Shadow, a young man recently released from prison, is taken on as driver and assistant for the mysterious Wednesday. They go to places on the cusp of the corporeal world, where they meet strange characters with stranger histories, as a growing sense of something ominous looms. Towards the end, there’s a series of forked paths, difficult choices: “Hard truths” or “fine lies”? Be wise, whole, or dead?It blurs dreams and reality; gods and mortals; the living, the dead, and the inbetween. The main narrative is interspersed with chapters about historical settlers and the gods they brought. The second half is infused with ideas about identity, faith, mortality, and reality. But overall, I was slightly disappointed – though 3* isn’t bad.Identity“Nobody’s American… not originally.”“Lady Liberty… like so many of the gods that Americans hold dear, a foreigner.”“This is the only country in the world… that worries about what it is.”Gaiman is a Brit who has lived in the US for many years. Britain is often portrayed as a nation of eccentrics, and Gaiman is drawn to the eccentricities of his new homeland. In an interview at the back, he says the chief difference between England and the US is that “England has history and America has geography”, but his story credits the US with both.He fondly caricatures the bizarre and often anticlimactic roadside attractions, built at mystical sites where previous civilisations would have built stone circles or temples, and he paints the idyllic town of Lakeside with hues of Stepford and Twin Peaks. He points out that the signs for small towns always state the population and usually have an obscure claim to fame, often sport-related, such as the town’s Under 14s team was the third runner-up in the interstate Hundred-Yard Sprint.Road TripA couple of weeks after reading this, we did an eclipse road trip in the US (which I blogged, with photos, in a GR reviewHERE). I looked out for strange signs: the printed (the smallest population I’ve seen previously is 79), the primordial, supernatural kind - and roadside attractions. On the crest of a hill in the Columbia River Gorge in Oregon, you can spot Stonehenge. It's a supposedly full-scale model (it's between half and 2/3), built as a memorial to US troops who died in WW1. The idea came from a man who visited the original at a time when it was thought to have been used for pagan human sacrifice. WW1 was a different, more worthy, type of human sacrifice.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryhil...Dead or Alive?“Call no man happy until he’s dead.” - HerodotusBut as Shadow points out, that doesn't mean the dead are happy, but rather, that “you can’t judge the shape of someone’s life until it’s over and done”.Gods abound, from a variety of times and places, including Norse, Ancient Egyptian, Hindu, central African, Asian, Irish, and central European. But the monotheistic God of the Abrahamic traditions does not feature. Not directly. There are strong parallels with the New Testament, though.“There’s power in the sacrifice of a son.”“Belief without blood only takes us so far… In the god business… it’s not the death that matters. It’s the opportunity for resurrection.”And the goddess, Easter, has a central role.“You’re not dead… but I’m not sure that you’re alive, either.”“Now, dying on the tree, [x] was utterly alive.”This idea of the living not being fully alive is also a recurring theme, but in a very different, non-spiritual sense, inThe Book of Ebenezer Le Page, which I recently reviewedHERE.“You people talk about the living and the dead as if they were mutually exclusive… As if you cannot have a river that is also a road, or a song that is also a color… Life and death are two sides of the same coin.”Stories, Islands, and Pearls“Lives are snowflakes - unique in detail, forming patterns we have seen before, but as like one another as peas in a pod”- which, of course, arenotvery alike when you really look.“We need individual stories… the statistics become people.”Like most writers of fantasy, Gaiman venerates the power of stories: ancient myths, but also the quotidian lives of ordinary folk. That’s the driving force here, and the life force for the gods. I guess it’s also the driving force of my reading, reviewing, and inner life.It’s also why people respond to the recent tragic story of an individual likeCharlie Gard, while ignoring larger scale tragedies, even if the latter are more solvable than the former. It’s not mere hypocrisy, but a specific sort of compassion fatigue, as Brian Resnick explainsHERE. Anecdote isn’t evidence, but it is a powerful force.But mostly, we prefer to protect ourselves from true but tragic stories. Gaiman claims Donne was wrong: weareislands, and therefore “we are insulated... from the tragedy of others, by our island nature, and by the repetitive shape and form of the stories”. Thus “we build a shell around it like an oyster dealing with a painful particle of grit... This is how we walk and talk and function... immune to others' pain and loss.”Perhaps this passage subconsciously prompted me to read Steinbeck’sThe Pearl(which I reviewedHERE) immediately after this, though I only noticed the connection when writing this review - days after writing up The Pearl.Personally, I think Donne and Gaiman both have pearls of truth: we are islands, but we have bridges and rescue boats at our disposal.We are connected if we care and dare to venture on the seas to those we love.Quotes* “To be a god... means you give up your mortal existence to become a meme: something that lives forever in people's minds... You barely have your own identity any more. Instead, you're a thousand aspects of what people need you to be... Nothing is fixed, nothing is stable.”* “His smiles were strange things… They contained no shred of humor, no happiness, no mirth… Like he had learned to smile from a manual.”* “Ideas are more difficult to kill than people, but they can be killed, in the end.”* “Chicago happened slowly, like a migraine.”* “The moonlight drained colors into ghosts of themselves.”* “Eyes, the dangerous blue of a sky when a storm is coming.”* “American history… is fictional, a charcoal-sketched simplicity for the children, or the easily bored… The American colonies were was much a dumping ground as an escape.”* “Like banana peel, only with bad taste and irony thrown in.” (A condom on the sidewalk.)* “It’s easier to kill people when you’re dead yourself… You're Not prejudiced any more.”* “Ice sheathed the winter-black bushes and trees as if they’d been insulated, made into dreams.”* “It smelled of people who had gone away to live other lives, and of all they had eaten and dreamed.”* “His anger seemed to have dissipated, or perhaps to have been invested for the future.”* “There were stars overhead hanging like frozen spears of light, stabbing the night sky.”* “Kansas was the cheerless gray of lonesome clouds, empty windows, and lost hearts.”* “People gamble to lose money. It’s a sacrifice of sorts.” Coin tricks rely on cupidity and greed, thus, it’s harder to scam an honest man.* “Since her death, Laura had not thought in metaphors; things were or they were not.”* “All your questions can be answered, if that is what you want. But once you learn your answers you can never unlearn them.”* “No longer scared of what tomorrow might bring because yesterday had brought it.”* “Not only are there no happy endings… There aren’t even any endings.”FlawsThis was my first encounter with a proper Gaiman novel. I loved his collaboration with Terry Pratchett,Good Omens(which I reviewedHERE), and his children’s novella,Coraline(which I reviewedHERE). In comparison, I felt this was lacking:* It was too long before anything obviously significant happens, or there are meaty ideas. The first half was both vague and detailed, thus confusing. But after that, as the strands came together, I started to appreciate it more. It needed to be shorter and taughter, imo.* Misdirection, especially coin tricks, is an entertaining constant. I thought following the coins would be key. They mattered, but the plot is disappointingly straightforward. There’s a huge cast, but few big surprises.* A detailed confession being accidentally overheard near the end is an easy cliché.* It's like Good Omens without the jokes.* The whole premise is that the gods will perish unless people believe in them, but:** If the gods travelled to the US, presumably versions stayed behind, so why is their survival in the US so crucial?** Towards the end, there is a neat exception: “It doesn’t matter that you didn’t believe in us… We believed in you.”With hindsight (and discussion in comments on other people's reviews), I realise I probably didn't pay enough attention to some of the historical chapters of people and gods coming to America, in part because I was frustrated with the vagueness of the first half. It's slightly like Atwood'sThe Blind Assassin(which I reviewedHERE): with that, I was too focused on the main narrative, so didn't give quite enough attention and admiration to the fictional story within the overall fiction..",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30165203-american-gods,American Gods.txt
The Blade Itself,"If you're serious about good fiction and are educated in storytelling, don't believe all of the praise for ""The Blade Itself.""Abercrombie's trilogy has been getting a lot of buzz in fantasy circles. Most readers call it ""unconventional fantasy,"" the back cover of my edition calls it ""noir fantasy,"" and the loftiest of readers call it ""literary fantasy."" I don't find any of these terms oxymoronic--but they are all applied incorrectly to this book. ""The Blade Itself"" is as uninteresting and cliche-riddled as anything else. In this review, I attack the most common points of praise: good fight scenes, complex characters, and tight plotting.One of the things praised near-universally is Abercrombie's ""fight scenes."" Anyone who's seen a film understands the difficulty of reproducing fast-paced physical combat in a less-than-ideal medium; writing fight scenes is hard. For the most part, at a technical level, Abercrombie holds his own. The fights have most of what they need: rhythm, description, visibility. What they frequently lack is a purpose, or emotional stakes. There's more to constructing compelling fights than ""someone's gonna die."" So when characters randomly come across highwaymen or ""Flatheads,"" the feeling is not of meaningful characters clashing--it's of Abercrombie forcing an adrenaline shot. (Speaking of those Flatheads, I still don't even know if they were human or some kind of gnoll; there's never a precise description.)I'm definitely not anti-battle. But the best fight scenes involve high stakes for both sides--stakes beyond physical preservation. Every scene present feels too one-sided. (As an example, consider Obi-Wan Kenobi VS. Darth Vader in ""A New Hope"": master and student, old friends, now representing entire philosophies of the Force's light and dark sides, of nigh-extinct Jedi and all-powerful Sith. Now consider Yoda VS. Count Dooku/Darth Tyrannus at the end of ""Attack of the Clones"": Yoda doesn't want him to escape, and they're, uh . . . opposed politically? Wow, look how acrobatic the little green guy is!)A second point of widespread acclaim for ""The Blade Itself"" is its characters. Common proclamations are that they break the fantasy mold by being flawed, witty, and antiheroic. I see an underlying assumption in these readers, though, and that's that the above character traits automatically make well-constructed characters. But despite hitting this literary checklist, Abecrombie's characters are flat and uncomplicated.Glokta was an up-and-coming knight crippled by torture, who became a torturer himself. He's spiteful towards everything. Okay. What else? Well, he schemes a lot. And he's witty. He thinks a lot of jokes in italics. And . . . I guess he wishes his leg didn't hurt all the time. What about this is interesting or complicated?Logen used to kill a bunch of people, but now he doesn't. His family got murdered by an acquaintance, someone for whom he used to kill people, now self-proclaimed ""King of the Northmen."" O, Irony!Jezal's handsome and rich and rakish, and he's training to win a contest and trying to bang this one chick. Sweet. Except it's his friend's sister, of no nobility. Bummer.And Ferro--she comes in halfway through the novel. She's a girl running from an emperor's harem and she's really angry and she kills all these people! Wicked!Alongside the mains is a Gandalfian wizard waiting in the rafters until the world needs him yet again, a normal guy who slaps his sister at one part, a woman with brains (gasp!) and a whole bunch of even less interesting secondaries.There's something readers of this book fail to understand. The cliches of yesterday are no longer the cliches of today. The gallant knight, the damsel in distress, the Dark Lord, the roguish wanderer; all are known to be cliche across fantasy, and as a result they don't appear anymore. Those cliche cliches (doubly cliche?) have been identified, catalogued, discussed at length, and hermetically sealed so that no one will ever use them again. The kind of characters Abercrombie uses are the new cliche, still fresh enough to be unrecognizable to the masses--antiheroes, dirty and uncouth, yet still saving the world in their own ragtag way. All of the book's characters--all, without exception--are basic and uncomplicated. Their motivations are too simple, their actions are unsurprising, and even their dialogue is tired.There's a special affront in the female characters. The new ""progressivism"" of male fantasy writers has been to abolish the uncomplicated princess and replace her with a richer female character. The result? A cliche as predictable as before, and just as insulting, only in a veiled way. The main female in too many modern fantasies (Ardee West is the character here) is the aforementioned ""woman with brains"" in a world where women don't have brains. Whether she's a peasant or a princess, her wit makes all the other characters afraid of her. She doesn't ""fit in."" Also, this commonly manifests physically--i.e., she's ""too tall."" In the end, though, this stuff doesn't matter; she always ends up with a guy who ""deserves"" her. While her narration and her dialogue might be more engaging than the cliched princesses of yore, she does nothing to bolster femininity in fantasy. She winds up wedded and bedded like all the rest. Giving a female a little wit to abolish cliche is no more significant a gesture than unknotting one of the princess's bows.(At this point, one might mention Ferro--the feral female, savage and furious, who shoots arrows through eyeballs more often than she says something witty. Okay. So a different bow is unknotted. This female can fight. This doesn't make her pro-fem, and it certainly doesn't make her a good anticliche--she's as crappy a character as any beefcake male who carries a six-foot sword and grunts a lot.)My final grievance is in the structure of this book--or perhaps the structure of this trilogy, and what this book was designed to do. This is the party-former. It doesn't even attempt to stand alone--there's no smaller goal in sight for the end of book one. Imagine if ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" ended in Rivendell with the forming of the fellowship. Wow, that kind of stinks. Now erase all knowledge of Sauron, the ring itself, or any clear endgoal for the obviously ensuing quest. Wow--that actually really stinking sucks. That's what ""The Blade Itself"" does. Things happen. There's little cause and effect. The chapters are a smattering of chain links spilled across the floor, and you won't even know what the broken chain should be attached to until the end. You'll read 500-odd pages of uninteresting characterization, artifically-inseminated fight scenes, and witty witter's witticisms (does Abercrombie truly think snarky one-liners are the height of comedy?) before hitting the end of the book and finding out that the story has yet to begin.If you're interested in all of the above by the end, great. You'll love the next two, I'm sure. I wasn't grabbed by any of it, though, and won't be finishing the series.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/944073.The_Blade_Itself,The Blade Itself.txt
The Eye of the World,"Reviewed by:Rabid ReadsNOTICE:this reread is in preparation for finally biting the bullet and reading book 14. That means I HAVE NOT read book 14 yet. Please be mindful of this in the comments, both for me and for others who may or may not have progressed past this point in the series. Thank you.It's hard for me to review this book, andonlythis book, objectively, b/c:1. WoT is my favorite high fantasy series. Ever.2. I've read the first eight books seven or eight times, maybe more (*whispers* I honestly don't know how many times I've read them). DON'T JUDGE.The first time, I was nineteen. Ish. I read all of the available books, back-to-back, schoolwork be damned.Then I read them again.YES, really.And I loved them even more the second time.I thrive on detail, you see. And Robert Jordan was a master of details. I caught so many previously missed foreshadowings, clevernesses, nuances, etc. that had flown right over my head the first time.It was spectacular.Like when Thom, Mat, and Rand jumped aboard Bayle Domon's ship, and Thom spun a tale for the captain, explaining how they happened to come upon his ship with Trollocs (nasty man-beast things) on their heels:Now it just so happened that he had earlier learned the location of Aridhol from a map given him many years ago by a dying friend in Illian whose life he had once saved . . .B/c didn't know it at the time, but Domon is an . . . wait for it . . .Illianer. *tips hat*The whole series is FULL of things like that.Rand al'Thor, Mat Cauthon, and Perrin Aybara are three young men on the cusp of adulthood. They live in Emond's Field, where they have small village concerns and small village lives.But when the previously mentioned Trollocs:attack their village, it forces them to accept that such creatures of the Dark One are not mere stories made up to scare children. And when the two strangers who arrived just prior to the attack turn out to be an Aes Sedai (wielder of the One Power) and her Warder (warrior/protector), the manboys learn that a small village life is not in the cards for them (HA!) and are forced to leave their homes to protect their families from the Great Lord of the Dark's minions, who won't stop until all three are in their master's grasp.Jordan does an excellent job of keeping you guessing: which manboy is the Dark One after and why? Is it really just the one, or is it all of them? If it is all of them, are they all equally important, or do the degrees vary? WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN?!B/c this is not a simple story.And one thing wedoknow is that Rand, Perrin, and Mat areta'veren, and as such they unwittingly pull others into their quest: a so-much-more-than-a-simple gleeman whose past regrets dictate his future actions, a young Ogier whose curiosity and wanderlust led him to leave his peacefulsteddinghome to see the things he's spent his life reading about, Rand's sweetheart who refuses to be left behind and longs to become an Aes Sedai herself, and the village Wisdom who feels compelled to both protect the young people from Aes Sedai machinations and also to break through the Warder's walls.Amongmanyothers.Each and every one of them vital in their own way.Also vital are the multitudes of seemingly random observations and commentary that in reality are the foundations of awesomeness to come.THESE BOOKS . . . layers and layers andstill morelayers. It's truly incredible.And despite having readThe Eye of the Worldso many times that I practically have it memorized, I have yet to grow immune to the very real and heartbreaking struggles that many of the characters face.Whether it's Rand's terrible journey from his farm in the Westwood to Emond's Field, dragging his injured father to safety, Loial's treesong to preserve a small part of his Treebrother's sanctuary in the Blight, or Nynaeve's yearning for a man bound to a never-ending battle that he cannot win . . . I still feel it. *rubs fist over heart*Deeply.And if you are unaffected by Moiraine's tale of the long fallen Manetheren:""But some did not flee. First in a trickle, then a river, then a flood, men went, not to safety, but to join the army fighting for their land. Shepherds with bows, and farmers with pitchforks, and woodsmen with axes. Women went, too, shouldering what weapons they could find and marching side by side with their men. No one made that journey who did not know they would never return. But it was their land. It had been their fathers', and it would be their children's, and they went to pay the price for it. Not a step of ground was given up until it was soaked with blood.""then you have only a black, shriveled thing in your chest cavity.SO. As daunting as this series may be (and I will never deny that itisdaunting) . . . if you are a lover of fantasy, and you haven't read Robert Jordan'sWheel of Time, you are doing yourself a major disservice.The Eye of the Worldhas the best prologue I've ever read IN MY LIFE, so I challenge you to read it. It's just a prologue. And if you don't feel the need to see what happens next, then hey . . . all you're out is the 15 minutes it took you to read it. ALSO, no one is holding a gun to your head. There's no law that says once you start, you can't stop until THE END. Take your time. Enjoy it. Or don't. Whatever. But my recommendation is that you do.These are the books that spawned my love of reading fantastical things as a adult.My other reviews for this series:The Great Hunt (Wheel of Time, #2) by Robert JordanThe Dragon Reborn (Wheel of Time, #3) by Robert JordanThe Shadow Rising (Wheel of Time, #4) by Robert JordanThe Fires of Heaven (Wheel of Time, #5) by Robert JordanLord of Chaos (Wheel of Time, #6) by Robert JordanA Crown of Swords (Wheel of Time, #7) by Robert JordanThe Path of Daggers (Wheel of Time, #8) by Robert JordanWinter's Heart (Wheel of Time, #9) by Robert JordanCrossroads of Twilight (Wheel of Time, #10) by Robert JordanNew Spring (Wheel of Time, #0) by Robert JordanHighlights:1.

Leaves covered the trees in ever greater profusion, but stained and spotted with yellow and black, with livid red streaks like blood poisoning. Every leaf and creeper seemed bloated, ready to burst at a touch. Flowers hung on trees and weeds in a parody of spring, sickly pale and pulpy, waxen things that appeared to be rotting while Rand watched. When he breathed through his nose, the sweet stench of decay, heavy and thick, sickened him; when he tried breathing through his mouth, he almost gagged. The air tasted like a mouthful of spoiled meat. The horses’ hooves made a soft squishing as rotten-ripe things broke open under them.Forsaken:1.“I am called Aginor,” the old one said. “And he is Balthamel.""""The seals weaken, Aes Sedai.

And the other one—a red eagle, an eye on a balance scale, a dagger with a ruby, a horn, and a laughing face. There are other things, but you see what I mean. This time I can’t make up or down out of any of it.” She waited then, still grinning, until he finally cleared his throat and asked.“What about me?”Her grin stopped just short of outright laughter. “The same kind of things as the rest. A sword that isn’t a sword, a golden crown of laurel leaves, a beggar’s staff, you pouring water on sand, a bloody hand and a white-hot iron, three women standing over a funeral bier with you on it, black rock wet with blood—""“All right,” he broke in uneasily. “You don’t have to list it all.”“Most of all, I see lightning around you, some striking at you, some coming out of you. I don’t know what any of it means, except for one thing. You and I will meet again.” She gave him a quizzical look, as if she did not understand that either.Lan: Malkier stuff.Thom: his nephew.Perrin: wolf = wolfbrother, or maybe Hopper if it's supposed to be a specific wolf. No idea about the broken crown, unless he's going to be the king of Manetheren, and trees flowering . . . *sobs* if you don't know what that's about, I'm not saying . . .Mat: red eagle = Manetheren, still no clue about the eye/balance scale thing (unless it comes up later, and I've forgotten. Which is entirely possible), dagger is dagger from Shadar Logoth, horn is Horn of Valere, and laughing face . . . probably related to his role as a ""trickster.""Rand:Callandor, Crown of Swords(from Illian?), don't know/can't remember about the beggar's staff, water in the Waste, bloody hand and white hot iron . . . not sure, three women and funeral bier, etc., again, if you don't know, I'm not telling.4.I believe in tradition, I do, but look what it got us last time.Luc dead in the Blight before he was ever anointed First Prince of the Sword, and Tigraine vanished—run off or dead—when it came time for her to take the throne.""5.“I’ve just remembered something, Aes Sedai, something I have always wanted to ask an Aes Sedai if ever I met one, since you know many things and have great libraries in Tar Valon, and now I have, of course, and . . . may I?”“If you make it brief,” she said curtly.“Brief,” he said as though wondering what it meant. “Yes. Well. Brief.There was a man came to Stedding Shangtai a little time back. This was not unusual in itself, at the time, since a great many refugees had come to the Spine of the World fleeing what you humans call the Aiel War.” Rand grinned. A little time back; twenty years, near enough. “He was at the point of death, though there was no wound or mark on him. The Elders thought it might be something Aes Sedai had done”—Loial gave Moiraine an apologetic look—“since as soon as he was within the stedding he quickly got well. A few months. One night he left without a word to anyone, simply sneaked away when the moon was down.” He looked at Moiraine’s face and cleared his throat again. “Yes. Brief. Before he left, he told a curious tale which he said he meant to carry to Tar Valon. He said the Dark One intended to blind the Eye of the World, and slay the Great Serpent, kill time itself. The Elders said he was as sound in his mind as in his body, but that was what he said. What I have wanted to ask is, can the Dark One do such a thing? Kill time itself? And the Eye of the World? Can he blind the eye of the Great Serpent? What does it mean?”Jain Farstrider??

Perdido Street Station,"I Love You, I Love You, I Love YouFor the fortnight it took me to read this novel, I was in another world and I was in love.Perhaps, now, I’ll retreat from that world and substitute another or others (or perhaps even return to my own world), but I will remain in love.Is this a fantasy love or is it real? I think it’s real.After all, is there any love that is not partly a product of your own mind?How can a writer make this happen? How can a reader experience this? How can a person experience it in real life?SPOILER WARNINGThis is a sensitive review of some of the major themes of the novel. I have limited discussion of the plot, except to the extent necessary to discuss themes. I identify the antagonists, but not the process or outcome of the antagonism. Some readers feel there are spoilers.Is This the Real Life? Is This Just Fantasy?I read a lot of fantasy and science fiction in my teens, when I was working out my taste in literature.I had a fairly active fantasy life. Things happened in my family life that I wanted to escape, not by imagining that they didn’t happen, but by constructing my own world, my own reality, as a refuge, as a place where I could restore myself and heal.This world exercised my brain like a muscle, I exerted my mind, I did not fear difficulty or effort or rationality or emotion or imagination. Instead, these things were concrete materials that I used to self-construct the me that is I.They allowed me to dream, to aspire, to do and to succeed. And to relax and to manage stress.Maps and LegendsComputerised war games were not an option in my childhood. I had plastic soldiers, metal tanks and artillery, model airplanes complete with World War I flying aces. Our home was raised about 1.5 meters off the ground and I built fictitious worlds in the hard black dirt, hills and valleys carved out of the soil and compacted, islands, isthmuses and peninsulas in imaginary oceans.Battles raged on the ground and in the air. Cannons shot matches across the rugged terrain and took the lives of the infantry. Pilots in planes suspended from the bottom of the floorboards engaged in fierce dogfights, until one or other plunged into a hillside or the watery stillness of my imaginary ocean.I mapped these worlds in the days before Google Earth. I created atlases of warfare, I assembled maps and legends, I taught myself German Text, so I could fill each page with my dreams. I imagined “libraries fat with forgotten volumes”, and mine.I wanted to be an engineer, then a cartographer, finally a diplomat. I wanted to be a lover of the foreign and the exotic, a traveller, a go-between, a communicator, an advocate, a negotiator, a master of the opening gambit, a player of trump cards, an unraveller of puzzles, a solver of problems, a snorter of diplomatic corps quality cocaine, a smoker of peace pipes, someone who might be remembered for bringing two disparate peoples (or people) together.Ultimately, I did not need fantasy literature, because I was my own fantasy and I created my own fantasy world. I drew my own map and I was my own legend.Fantasy fiction and science fiction moved on without me, while I discovered literature that helped me understand people, relationships, the world we live in.The closest I have got to fantasy recently has been the works of Haruki Murakami. I think I’m passionate about his novels, because they deal with the real world, almost by using fantasy as a way of seeing, a method of perception, an instrument to detect, dissect and comprehend.Then, China Mieville appeared on the horizon and rocketed into the relative security of my world like a V2 from “Gravity’s Rainbow”.“Perdido Street Station” (“PSS”) sat on my shelf unread for a few years, even after I read and enjoyed “The City and the City”.When Traveller started a Discussion group on CM’s works, I decided that now was the time to bite the bullet and find out what CM was really about.I realised, then , that I was falling in love.”What Trick of Topography Is This?What did CM do to make me fall so?Let me try to tell you as best I can…PSS is first and foremost the tale of a city, of New Crobuzon. (I still have to pronounce this word carefully. I have never spoken it to a person in real life. Even now I mouth it hesitantly.)It sits astride the confluence of two rivers, the Tar and the Canker, which join to form one, the waters from the two retained, but somehow transformed, almost dialectically, into the River Gross Tar.New Crobuzon is an Industrial Age City-State Republic. It teems with people, beings, trade, commerce, ideas, ambitions, success, failure, suffering and misery.It teeters at some tipping point where just a nudge could bring the entire structure collapsing down like Einsturzende Altbauten.And, surely, some peril does emerge to give it that nudge, but cometh the time, cometh the man.Only in CM’s hands, it is not just cometh the man, it is cometh the man and the woman (women actually).They are not your common or garden variety heroes (just as the antagonists are not common or garden variety moths).They are an indie “band a parte”, in a Godardian or Tarantino-esque sense. You could almost call them a “motley crew”, except that CM has reserved that name for one of the principal antagonists.They are a ragamuffin bunch of outcasts with outré taste (1).(1) Outre:(a) Out of the common course or limits; extravagant;(b} Bizarre; outlandish (as in, an outré costume)Example:My first mental development had in it much of the uncommon - even much of the outré.- Edgar Allan Poe.Boys and Girls Own AdventureEven as I write this, I realise that PSS contains something of Charles Dickens, British Imperial adventure stories (especially tales of Biggles and his various sorties), pulp fiction, B-movies, French originals, Hollywood re-makes and cheap Italian rip-offs.To quote critic Don D'Ammassa from the Introduction to the “Encyclopedia of Adventure Fiction” (thank you Wiki):”An adventure is an event or series of events that happens outside the course of the protagonist's ordinary life, usually accompanied by danger, often by physical action.“Adventure stories almost always move quickly, and the pace of the plot is at least as important as characterization, setting and other elements of a creative work.”D'Ammassa argues that the element of danger must be the principalfocusof an adventure novel.For him, Charles Dickens' novel “A Tale of Two Cities” is an adventure novel because the protagonists are in constant danger of being imprisoned or killed.In contrast, “Great Expectations” is not, because ""Pip's encounter with the convict is an adventure, but that scene is only a device to advance the main plot, which is not truly an adventure.""While this distinction might be intellectually astute, I don’t really care to apply it to PSS.It is a stew with meat and vegetables. There would be no gain from an argument about what is principal or secondary.Suffice it to say that, what embarks from the intellectual platform later becomes a rollercoaster ride.A Fine, but Medieval, RomanceApart from the scientific and philosophical content, the other aspect of PSS that immediately appealed to me was the romance, especially the extent to which it was overtly erotic.Again, while trying to define the role of adventure in PSS, I stumbled across a discussion in Wiki, which helped me define my appreciation of the romance at the heart of the novel:” Adventure has been a common theme since the earliest days of written fiction. Indeed, the standard plot of medieval romances was a series of adventures.“Following a plot framework as old as Heliodorus, and so durable as to be still alive in Hollywood movies, a hero would undergo a first set of adventures before he met his lady. A separation would follow, with a second set of adventures leading to a final reunion.”That isn’t a bad summary of the plot of PSS at an abstract level.At the level of a medieval romance, there is a sense in which a knight errant (Isaac), portrayed as having heroic qualities (hmm), goes on a quest and experiences various marvel-filled adventures (hmm).Later, these types of stories were recast from an ironic, satiric or burlesque point of view (e.g., “Don Quixote”).It might be more accurate to place PSS within this later romantic tradition.Isaac is not exactly a hero, but he is not quite an anti-hero. He is a post-modern, fat bastard, nerdy, scientific Everyman, who rises to the occasion when he is called upon.There is a debate in the Discussion Group as to whether he is naïve, especially because he has eschewed a traditional academic career in order to pursue his more outré personal scientific vision.I wouldn’t call this naïve, though I would settle for idealistic, even if it requires him to get down, get his hands dirty and even get his clothes a little grubby.Strange Partners: The Curious Dance of the New Woman and the Imperial AdventurerI’ve borrowed this title from the name of a review by Teresa Mangum of the study, “New Woman and Colonial Adventure Fiction in Victorian Britain: Gender, Genre, Empire” by Lee Anne M. Richardson.If you’ll allow me to treat Isaac as an Imperial Adventurer, then Lin is the New Woman who enjoys a curious dance with him.It’s not just curious because of their moves, but because of their physical make-up.New Crobuzon doesn’t just consist of human forms, it consists of multiple sentient life forms, many of which have characteristics associated with ancient religions and mythology.Lin is a Khepri with a female body and a scarab beetle head.She is an artist with an outré taste and sensibility, while Isaac is the outcast scientist who falls in love with her, even though this is perceived as a socially taboo transgression.Needless to say, there is not just love, but a smorgasbord of sensory pleasures including sight, scent, taste, touch, lust and pleasure sex, notwithstanding the partial physiological incompatibility.Some readers seem to be grossed out by this physical challenge. I felt it highlighted the authenticity of their love. I found the relationship convincing and highly erotically charged.While I’m not widely read in the field of erotica and pornography, CM’s vision of this relationship really turned me on.It would take a great writer to write scenes of affection and delight that appealed to me as much as those featuring Lin and Isaac.MothroticaHaving said that, CM replicates the erotic charge in his description of the principal antagonists in the novel.The threat to New Crobuzon comes from giant slake-moths that feed on dreams.We see them transform through their life cycle from larva to pupa to adulthood, from caterpillar to cocoon to moth.During pupation, the larval structures of the moth are broken down, while the adult structures are formed.The pupa is inactive and usually static and sessile (unable to move about).They derive sustenance from the psychic energy of the non-rational part of the mind of those around them. They suck out the dreams of the inhabitants of New Crobuzon and leave them mindless and mute.Feeding is described in almost sexual terms, but having fed, the slake-moths become sexually active and fertile, they fly around, looping, falling, stroking, touching, arousing, copulating…juicily, ardently, ecstatically.This is gross, even though CM uses the same language he would use for Lin and Isaac.It’s worse when you know that slake-moths are “efficient, brilliant predators” and that they have no natural predators of their own.However, the juxtaposition of their non-sentient sexuality with that of Lin and Isaac makes me wonder why their sexual activity cannot be enjoyed, theoretically at least, to the same extent as other erotic behavior.The answer must be that it is just too remote from what we are used to, besides it might be the sentience that creates the proximity to human sexual response.As I’ve mentioned, even scarab beetle heads are too remote for some readers. There is a point at which sexual experience is too animal, and not sufficiently close to human sexuality to enjoy.However, CM at least asks us to contemplate sexuality, transgression and pleasure beyond what we are comfortable with.Rape as Social TransgressionI won’t mention their name out of a concern for spoilers, but one of the characters is suffering a punishment for a rape.While this act is offensive and illegal within our society, in the context in which it occurred, it is not punishable as a crime in its own right, but as an example of depriving a person of their right to choose.Thus, instead of rape being cast as an offence against the body, it is cast as an offence against the mind.It denies the freedom of the “victim” and limits their choice.The penalty might be the same or even higher. However, CM uses this conceptualization of the crime to test Isaac’s reaction to the punishment.Initially, he sympathises with the perpetrator and can’t understand the gravity of the crime.Then, when he translates the act from the apparently innocuous restriction of choice to physical rape, he starts to sympathise with the “victim”, Kar’uchai, who doesn’t want to be painted as a victim and simply asks Isaac to respect the laws of her society and the punishment it regards as appropriate.Kar’uchai counsels Isaac not to translate her society’s laws into his social context, but instead to appreciate them on their own terms.Ultimately, despite his affinity with his friend, Isaac elects to respect the law of her society, to respect its sovereignty, almost as if it was primarily an issue of international relations.Obviously, it is still a moral and criminal issue. However, Isaac accepts that each society has the right to define and enforce its own practices, customs and laws.It is not always appropriate, at least in the quasi-Victorian Steampunk era, to judge a society from the outside.Isaac’s “Principia Mothematica”Isaac has had a number of scientific interests during his career, including Unified Field Theory, where his allegiance is to Moving Theory rather than Static Theory.However, the interest most relevant to the battle with the slake-moths is crisis energy and his invention of a crisis engine.So what is crisis energy?This is major shit we’re dealing with here, mate, so…um…pay attention.1. We’re talking about the energy in matter such as an object.2. There are three types of energy: kinetic, potential and crisis.3. Kinetic energy is the energy the object possesses due to its motion.4. Potential energy is the energy the object has when it’s placed in a position, so that it’s teetering or about to change its state (e.g., you’ve lifted it up and are about to drop it).5. Crisis energy is the energy that is inside an object by virtue of its being or existence. It’s not necessarily there because it’s moving or because it’s been moved to a particular position. It’s there, because it’s already in the object, wherever it is or wherever it’s placed. There are incredible tensions within any object, no matter what its state. If it can be moved toward a state of crisis, a point when it is about to change its form or state (a transformation or transmogrification), the crisis energy will manifest itself, and can be tapped.Isaac’s goal is to tap or channel or harness crisis energy. If he succeeds, he will virtually have achieved a perpetual energy source and perpetual motion.He achieves his goal by constructing a crisis engine that can channel energy and amplify the output.Whereas Thomas Pynchon’s “Gravity’s Rainbow” is about entropy, PSS is about the exact opposite: the maximization of energy.The rest is secret. (I shouldn’t even have told you what’s above. I’m going to get into trouble with the Moderator General.)Ethical CleansingUltimately, it’s up to Isaac and his crisis engine to wage war on the slake-moths.Because everybody in New Crobuzon is threatened by the moths, various coalitions are proposed.Isaac’s best prospect comes from the Construct Council, which is a machine that is on the fringe of acquiring an artificial intelligence called “constructed intelligence”, a mechanical form of sentience. It’s just a calculating intelligence that is trying to “self-construct” or maximize itself, to ascend a hierarchy of intelligence.While he partners it, ultimately, he does not trust it totally, because it has no empathy or morals:”It'll do whatever it has to - it'll lie to us, it'll kill - to increase its power.”Whatever, he cannot let it have unrestricted access to the crisis engine. (Cue dramatic music.)Just as Isaac tried to take an objective ethical stance with respect to rape, he does the same with the war on the slake-moths.The Nectar of the SubconsciousThe slake-moths are dream eaters that prey on the subconscious. They detect and suck out hidden thoughts, guilty thoughts, anxieties, delights, dreams:""They drink the peculiar brew that results from self-reflexive thought, when the instincts and needs and desires and intuitions are folded in on themselves and we reflect on our thoughts and then reflect on the reflection, endlessly... Our thoughts ferment like the purest liquor...not the meat-calories slopping about in the brainpan, but the fine wine of sapience and sentience itself, the subconscious. Dreams.""They leave their victims mindless and imbecile.While calculating or thinking machines might be able to replicate rationality, they cannot replicate morality. They can replicate consciousness, but they cannot replicate a conscience:” I do not dream. I am a calculating machine that has calculated how to think. I do not dream. I have no neuroses, no hidden depths. My consciousness is a growing function of my processing power, not the baroque thing that sprouts from your mind, with its hidden rooms in attics and cellars.""”CM’s message seems to be that rationality is not enough to make us human. We need our passions and morality as well. We need our sentiments to be sentient. We need experience to be sapient.Isaac, the fat bastard outcast scientist has mastered reason, but it is not enough. He has stared the Enlightenment in the face and realized there is More Than This.Reason will allow us to peak through the keyhole, but if we want to open the doors of perception, we need more.The Transformation of LoveMuch of PSS is concerned with transformation, transgression and translation, the movement from one state to another.Lin is caught in a “bastard zone”, Motley is trapped in a “ruptured moment”.Perhaps, love is the drug, the remedy that is required.The romantic in me wants to believe that CM regards love as a raptured moment that will stand in opposition to or on the shoulders of pure reason.The relationship between Lin and Isaac is a clue to the transformation he thinks might be required.Their love, transgressive as it might be, consists of “filthy and loving invitations” as well as “jokes and apologies and compliments and lust.”Lin longs “to come home every night to freshly mixed fruit salad and theatre tickets and sex.""Isaac would be content just to look into the eyes of his scarab queen and hear her ask, “How was it, treasure?”Some time during the night, they might even be heard to cry out, “I Love You, I Love You, I Love You.”It’s up to each of us to decide whether this is a love worth having.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68494.Perdido_Street_Station,Perdido Street Station.txt
The Well of Ascension,"Re-read on audio and just as awesome the second time! Vin is still my hero!❤️Holy son of a biscuit eater!!! THIS BOOK! I loved it, loved it, loved it! Sanderson tackled most of my feels in this book and YES I cried here and there but most of it was happy crying. My dog even looked at me like I was crazy when I was laughing and crying and yelling YES at certain parts.Vin landed softly on the damp cobblestones, watching as the mists began to form around her. They puffed into existence as darkness fell, growing like tangles of translucent vines, twisting and wrapping around one another.The great city of Luthadel was still. Even now, a year after the Lord Ruler's death and the rise of Elend's new free government, the common people stayed in their homes at night. They feared the mists, a tradition that went far deeper than the Lord Ruler's laws.Vin slipped forward quietly, senses alert. Inside herself, as always, she burned tin and pewter. Tin enhanced her senses, making it easier for her to see in the night. Pewter made her body stronger, made her lighter on her feet. These, along with copper--which had the power to hide her use of Allomancy from others who were burning bronze--were metals she left on almost all the time.Some called her paranoid. She thought herself prepared. Either way, the habit had saved her life on numerous occasions.I love Vin and she grew so much in this book. She had a very bad life growing up and Kelsier (sob) saved her from all of that and showed her how to be what she is: A Mistborn. (An Allomancer who can burn all of the Allomantic medals) and she became the most powerful Mistborn around.Elend is the King but he wasn't doing such a great job. He needed to be whipped into shape. I think Tindwyl (a Keeper from Terris) did a wonderful job and getting Elend where he needed to be. I feel Elend figured the rest out on his own and I began to love his character later on in the book.Tindwyl nodded. ""Sazed also mentioned your humility. It could be an asset-assuming you don't let it get in the way. Now, I believe that your Mistborn has returned.""Elend turned toward the side window. The shutter swung open, allowing mist to begin streaming into the room and revealing a crouching, cloaked form.""How did you know I was here?"" Vin asked quietly.Tindwyl smiled--the first such expression Elend had seen on her face. ""Sazed mentioned you as well, child. You and I should speak soon in private, I think.""Vin slipped into the room, drawing mist in behind her, then closed the shutter. She didn't bother to hide her hostility or mistrust as she put herself between Elend adn Tindwyl.""Why are you here?"" Vin demanded.Tindwyl smiled again. ""It took your king there several minutes to get to that question, and here you ask it after a few bare moments. You are an interesting couple, I think.""Vin's eyes narrowed.""Regardless, I should withdraw,"" Tindwyl said. ""We shall speak again, I assume, Your Majesty?""""Yes, of course."" Elend said. ""Um. . . is there anything I should begin practicing?""""Yes,"" Tindwyl said. ""Stop saying um.""""Right.""Tindwyl had a lot of work to get the king where he needed to be but she did well.So many of the characters I loved.VinElendSazedOreSeurHamDocksonClubsSpookBreezeTindwylAllrianneSome of them didn't make it in the battles and that is sad but that is the way of the world.I also really liked Zane but . . . .*I loved the characters, I loved the book, I loved everything about it but a few things.*NOW ON TO THE SPOILER PORTION OF THIS BOOK. DO NOT READ BELOW THIS LINE IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK!Okay lets get down to the nitty gritty. I'm going to be all over the place with this so just bear with me.Zane is the other mistborn that would visit with Vin and sometimes fight with her. We find out that he is Elends half-brother. I really liked him and wanted him to be good but he had some major issues cause by their father that is/was a complete jerk. I really hated to see him die but it had to happen. I certainly didn't see it coming.Elend's father along with two other army's are parked outside the city, they all want to take over Luthadell so they can all have the atium. It's a big time metal that lets mistborns see into others futures and when they are burning it they normally can't be killed. Until Vin proved that wrong!When Vin killed Straff (Elend and Zane's father) I was freaking out of my mind with joy! I didn't like what happened to the horse but still. It was freaking awesome that she finally took his sorry arse out!Another camp had king Cett in it and he was just stupid, that's all I got. But his daughter, Allrianne was pretty cool. I liked her.The last camp had an old friend of Elend as the leader and he had these monster things called Koloss, they were these blue giant things and they were not stable at all. They killed each other as much as they killed other people. He controlled them through money and luck, in the beginning anyway.Most of the beginning of the book is learning about Vin and Elend, trying to get them where they need to be, learning things from Sazed and Tindwyl, figuring out how to defeat the armies and not knowing where the atium was in the city. They never did find it so it seemed like they were all going to get killed for nothing.Sazed really surprised me. He was a Keeper but had some issues back home, but he still did his work. But he freaking used all kinds of powers and turned into Hulk Sazed when it was time to fight the Koloss! He was freaking amaze balls! He had sent Vin, Elend and Spook away on a wild goose chase for the well of ascension and Vin had to rush back (pun intended) to help everyone. The town was going to die without her. She was so mad but she understood what Sazed was trying to do. She got there in the nick of time!The koloss loomed over Sazed, who still lay half sprawled in the bloody slush, and raised its sword. Over the creature's shoulder, Sazed could see the red sun hanging just above the top of the wall. He focused on that, rather than on the falling sword. He could see the rays of sunlight, like . . . shards of glass in the sky.The sunlight seemed to sparkle, twinkling, coming for him. As if the sun itself were welcoming him. Reaching down to accept his spirit.And so, I die . . .A twinkling droplet of light sparkled in the beam of sunlight, then hit the koloss directly in the back of the skull. The creature grunted, stiffening, dropping it's sword. It collapsed to the side, and Sazed lay, stupefied, on the ground for a moment. Then he looked up at the top of the wall.A small figure stood silhouetted by the sun. Black before the red light, a cloak flapped gently on her back. Sazed blinked. The bit of sparkling light he'd seen. . . it had been a coin. The koloss before him was dead.Vin had returnedJust typing that scene out gave me chills once again and made me tear up in joy! Vin is bad to the damn bone, there is no doubt about that. At one point after killing hundreds of the monsters, Vin figured out how to control them so that was even more awesome!I was really sad for Sazed for losing Tindwyl, they had finally admitted their love for each other in a sense and it was so sad to see him go through his grief.I also hated that Clubs and Dockson had to die but this is what happens. I dread to see how else will die in the next book =(Oh, I forgot to mention how much I loved OreSeur (Vin's Kandra). Kelsier had given him to her when he died and the kandra have contracts to do what you say. They are slaves basically. They take on forms of humans or animals by eating their bones after they are already dead. They don't kill people themselves. Vin at one point turned OreSeur into a wolfhound. So awesome, but he wasn't happy about being a dog. But he finally got used to it. But then I find out that OreSeur was killed and replaced with Zane's kandra (TenSoon) to spy on Vin. I was crushed, but it turned out that TenSoon wasn't so bad. There is a lot more to it but you can read about it.Vin finds the well of ascension in the town. It calls to her. She's not supposed to be there. Sazed tries to stop her but doesn't quite make it. She goes into the well to save Elend's life (her husband, yeah they got married in a quick little ceremony with Sazed while was stitching her up) and she let loose something that wasn't supposed to be let loose on the world. But she saved Elend and turned him into a freaking Mistborn. I mean wow. I can only imagine what's going to happen in the next book!I'm going to shut up now as I have left a long rambling review of this book. It just thrilled me that much!Thank you Brandon Sanderson for these characters I love so much!MY BLOG:Melissa Martin's Reading List",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68429.The_Well_of_Ascension,The Well of Ascension.txt
Neon Gods,"This is complicated.The tl;dr is that, while I really loved elements of this, I didn’t like it as much as the first three Wicked Villain books.The not tl;dr is … it’s complicated.One of the things I admire about KR as an author is she’s super … mindful, I think, about what she’s doing. Or, y’know, most things that she’s doing. Nobody can be mindful about everything because then they’d be omniscient. But basically there are things she’s focused on—things she’s interested in and, I assume, thinks are important—and everything else can kind of go fuck itself.I can’t deny that I admire this as an approach to one’s own work.Although it does mean as a reader you can either get on the KR train or you can be smooshed by the KR train as it steams past. With Neon Gods, I sort of felt like I was running alongside the KR train, desperate to get on board, but somehow I didn’t quite make it? And I can’t quite figure out whether that’s because I was late at the station or because the, err, KR book train only opened its doors for, like, 3.5 seconds.I need to drop this metaphor.Basically, there’s zero point banging on about the world-building here. One does not read KR for the world-building. In a KR book, the plot is ONLY (and kind of explicitly) there to facilitate the emotional and sexual connection of the characters. And, y’know, that’s fine. That’s what I mean about getting on the KR train. However, I think this is where I first began struggling with Neon Gods: the world-building is flimsy and nonsensical (and that’s what I was prepared for) but it’s also … it also takes up a lot of page count. And I don’t mean in a “this reader is only here for the kinky sexing"" sense, but it was a bit weird to find myself spending so much time wading through something that not only I wasn’t super interested in, it felt like the author wasn’t super interested in either.Although this might also be a “first book in a series” issue, because first books in a series have to bear the double-weight of their own story AND establishing the framework for a bunch of other stories too.Whinging aside, all of the things I really adore about KR’s work are present in Neon Gods. As ever, her approach to consent is fucking immaculate. Exhibitionism is sort of the kink du jour here (and it’s especially interesting because the heroine is more about it than the hero, but he’s into it because she is, which is not a dynamic I see explored very often) and the heroine gives her verbal consent to intense public sex, that—in the moment—neither of them decide they want to go through with on that particular occasion. I just really appreciate this sort of stuff: the reminder that consent is a spectrum and can (and should) be withdrawn at any time, and even the idea that you can consent to something fully meaningfully in abstract, but that doesn’t mean you also have to consent to the reality of it if you aren’t feeling it.That’s just … so hot to me. And feels like such a necessary pushback to the toxic and annoyingly persistent idea that consent isn’t or can’t be sexy.Similarly—and I’ve seen in this in Wicked Villains too—I really love how much flexibility KR builds into her sex scenes, and this carries through into Neon Gods. A lot of romances tend to a portray kink as kind of a … static thing? Like the dom/me says “Imma do this thing to you” and the sub is “ooh, yay” and then the dom does that thing, and then there’s aftercare. But in a KR book scenes shift, adapt and sometimes stop altogether in response to the in-the-moment needs of her characters.Again. That’s just … so hot to me.Plus, you’ve got the usual KR themes: active submission, heroines with agency, in this particular book the notion that allowing yourself to be cared for isn’t weakness, it’s a strength. All that stuff I am so very very into. Except I still didn’t quite connect to Neon Gods as much as I wanted to. I think due to the world-building issue I mentioned above, an unsatisfying conclusion (from both a plot and romantic perspective) and wanting—of all things—a bit more from Persephone. There’s lots to like about her, she’s strong, and determined, and not an idiot, and there’s a wonderful twist where the Hades/Persephone bargain is her initiative, not his (thus subverting the romance sex-bargain trope, which is usually insisted upon by the man, and therefore, frankly, more than a little problematic) but I never really felt I knew who she was.We’re told who she is, a fair bit. Hades keeps comparing her to sunshine, and her backstory is very much about pretending to be Demeter’s “perfect” daughter in the eyes of the press. To the extent that I was eventually imagining her as a Greek Blake Lively. But none of this felt narratively real and so it was hard to engage with her actual, y’know, arc? The way she changes—how she grows, finds herself and is empowered—through her choices and her connection with Hades.Hades, though. What an utter darling. I’ll take five.Seriously, though. He’s one of KR’s … I hesitate to use the word “soft” because of its negative connotations. How about … more human doms? Which is to say, he has more in common with Hook in A Worthy Opponent than Hades in Learn My Lesson—although he’s still very much his own person and, perhaps, one of KR’s more emotionally vulnerable heroes? Again, we’re told he’s grumpy and brooding and whatever, but he’s clearly a complete melt from the second he’s on page (right down to the fact that Hermes and Dionysus, who I very much enjoyed, are basically treating his house, and his fridge, like their own). There’s even puppies later. Actual puppies.Something I sincerely loved about the book was that both Hades and Persephone have reciprocal arcs around allowing themselves to *be* cared for and *be* protected. The scenes where Persephone demonstrates to Hades that she’s as alert to, and preoccupied with, his needs as he is with hers are absolutely feels-hitting. Plus there’s a “hero reveals his literal scars” scene that is tender and didn’t seem to be focused on milking the ol' manpain. So that was nice. And I did appreciate that Hades was allowed to seek, need and accept this kind of sweetness / care-taking from Persephone without it negatively impacting either his masculinity or his domliness. Again, this is something I’d like to see more of in general.Something that should not feel subversive but nevertheless always does.Anyway: I think, having babbled about this for ages now, I wish there’d been more space on page for Hades and Persephone to be who are they are, instead of pushing them towards a tropey grumpy/sunshine dynamic that, actually, served to diminish the strength of their connection and the nuances of their characterisation. Plus I wonder if the myth backdrop (and let me very clear, I am absolutely not getting into whether I feel this was a “fair” or “accurate” re-telling of a myth, it’s a bloody myth, it can be re-told however) was meant to act much like Disney movies do in Wicked Villains, only with less likelihood of severe and immediate legal action from a large and evil corporation. Because obviously when it comes to a character like Jasmine (for example) it’s the easiest thing in the world to make the imaginative leaps the author is expecting: I mean, OBVIOUSLY she has Daddy issues, OBVIOUSLY she feels trapped by her life (she literally has a song about it in Aladdin). I just don’t think myths work quite as effectively for providing that background: partly because they belong to a different cultural context and partly because there’s so many versions of them. I think, if I squint, I can get to the idea that Persephone as a mythical archetype could be seen as the daughter of an overbearing mother forced into a mould of public perfection. But it doesn’t feel as natural as or as obvious to me as, say, Meg is a damaged switch and Hercules is an adorable sub.The other thing that left me a bit quizzical was the role, or lack of role, queerness played in the book. Now, this is one is really difficult because I think it’s a given of any KR universe that all characters are bisexual. And, on the one hand, that’s great. We live in a default-heterosexual universe right now, and it, frankly, sucks. So, yes, I love the idea of a default-queer universe (to be honest, I think I tend to write default-queer universes myself) and I think it’s valuable to have a writer (to have writers) just occupy that kind of space without fanfare or explanation. It’s normalising and inclusive and positive. Yay. The problem is though (and this is a ‘complexity of representation’ problem, not a KR problem) that it can also feel … tokenistic. And I honestly don’t know how to navigate that.I think Neon Gods has been the most heteronormative-seeming book of KR’s that I’ve read, since Desperate Measures, when I was grumpy that Jafar wasn’t more queer-coded (though Jasmine is, of course, enthusiastically bisexual as fuck). Both Persephone and Hades are, we can assume, bisexual both by dint of living in a KR universe, but also because she references an ex-girlfriend, and he references an ex-boyfriend. However, they’re also pretty much each other-sexual for the entire duration of the book. And this is fine. This should be fine.After all, not like every couple needs to be having a multi-gender 5some every Tuesday evening to prove their queerness. And queer attraction is not … just one thing. A sexuality that is primarily partner-focused is neither queer nor straight, and it’s messy to insist that queer sexuality is always addressed through explicit on page attraction to multiple genders. I mean, if pansexual characters go around constantly lusting after everyone then you’re straying perilously close to the spiked pit of the “slutty pansexual” stereotype. On top of which, it’s perfectly possible—perfectly normal—to experience queer attraction without queerness feeling like much of your identity. And that too is fine. This should be fine.So the minimal bisexuality of Hades and Persephone should also be fine. And rationally I think it is. Not that I am the arbiter of fine for other people’s depiction of queerness. But it still felt … odd. And that is not me saying the book is bad, or the author has done a bad (that’s not my call to my make), or that bisexuality has to be portrayed a certain way, or that it only counts as bisexuality if both characters are genitals deep in every possible gender-identity available to them. But I think there’s a really narrow line between a character’s queerness being irrelevant in a way that feels positive and affirming, and a character’s queerness being irrelevant in a way that just feels … irrelevant.And I don’t know where that line is. And I think it’s probably different for different people.Plus, there’s a really odd bit where Hades is getting all romance-possessive on Persephone and he says:“Someday, when you let some asshole seduce you and you’re riding their cock, remember tonight and know that they will never compare to me. You think of me when they’re inside you.”Which just seems like a really …I’ll stick with odd … thing to say to a woman you know is bisexual when you are bisexual yourself. I mean, I appreciate that it’s a non-gendered cock she’s riding in this hypothetical scenario. But, like, surely if you’re that possessive you would care about ANY lover, not just a lover with a penis? Because otherwise it kind of seems like Hades is saying love/sex between people of matching genitals doesn’t … um … count in the same way? Or, indeed, sex where Persephone might be the one inside her lover?Come on, Hades. This is nonsense. Stop being weirdIn any case, while this wasn’t my favourite KR, I still got a lot out of Neon Gods. In particular, there’s a scene on the throne, which I won’t spoil, that is worth the price of admission alone. It is very much KR at the top of her game and an absolutely gorgeous moment. *chef’s kiss*.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54659771-neon-gods,Neon Gods.txt

Maya and the Rising Dark,"(Warning: I don't spoil anything too badly I think. There is spoilery-y talk, however, which depending on how good you are at piecing things together may reveal more than I intended. You have been warned.)This book made me question whether or not it is possible to outgrow a genre. My belief before was that you couldn't because as long as you adjusted your expectations accordingly you could read anything and have some level of satisfaction. After all, I love picture books despite the demographic being fifteen years beneath me.Maya and the Rising Dark has forced me to reconsider my stance.If you have read Percy Jackson, Aru Shah, or Tristan Strong I'd say you've already read this to some degree. And that doesn't have to be a bad thing. A lot of people, myself included, can enjoy the same story repackaged as originality is not the end all be all of a story. It’s all in the execution. Obviously, I found the execution in this case lacking.The pacing is very poor. Like many mediocre middle grade or young adult books, it does not truly start until nearly 50% in. It spends an exorbitant amount of time on needless and/or rehashed exposition, emphasis on the rehashing. It doesn’t help that a majority of the info we find out in the first half is information the reader can ascertain to an extent by the synopsis. The rest could have been trickled out throughout the novel instead of info dumped before the adventure has a chance to start.Example: They go to an Orisha council meeting to see what the plan is for rescuing her father. At this meeting Maya gives a rundown of all the Orisha on the council despite the fact that she just explained about several of them when they made their first appearance literally the chapter before. To add insult to injury, there are other Orisha present for Maya to expand on. There is no need to go into detail about these same ones.When Maya does finally depart on her mission it’s boring because the world building is ill defined so as to allow Barton to do whatever she wants to keep the story moving. There is no internal logic or consistency.22% in the kids are confronted by a group of Dark Bringers. It is revealed Frankie has powers of some kind. She is unable to call them forth again as she was only able to do so before out of necessity. She had no idea she had these powers nor any means of control. Yet, at 52% when attacked again suddenly Frankie is wielding these powers as if she’s been practicing for years despite spending the intervening time mostly in denial. There's no discussion or amazement at her ability to do it again. Frankie herself isn't even shocked, she's just able to do it and the characters all act as if she’s never struggled a day in her life.They need to open a gateway to the Dark Bringer dimension. Once this is done, Maya doesn’t know how to close it. It’s suggested she can manipulate the code around the gateway to do so. Okay, but she had no idea she could do that when she decided to look for the gateway. So for all intents and purposes, it’s happenstance that it works. It’s written as if it’s an intuitive thing for Maya to achieve which comes off as a cop-out as this isn't a one-off. It’s part of a pattern not an anomaly.Maya does not have powers. This is a source of great insecurity. Boom, suddenly Maya is just able to use magic now.It’s indicative of how poorly developed the entire universe is, especially the magical systems. Conflict is practically nonexistent as a result. The kids are never in any real danger of being stumped or forced to figure out puzzles or meet any kind of deadline. They use magic to get out of every scrape. It’s not about wits or patience or effort. It’s all luck, coincidence or author manipulation.Example: Two Dark Bringers masquerade as Maya’s friends. Maya figures it out immediately, solely because the Dark Bringers are so stupid they can barely maintain the ruse. Why would they even be sent if they couldn't reasonably fake it? One of them can barely keep the hate out of their voice talking about her dad. The other didn't even know that Eli is obsessed with ghosts. They're so incompetent I don't see why this was even attempted. It’s an attempt to make Mayaseemclever without creating legitimate obstacles to prove it.When Maya gets her powers it’s due to her ever present staff being out of commission. I was actually looking forward to the staff being out of play in order to force them to work something out for themselves for once as the staff is a major crutch. Five minutes after it's gone Maya pulls powers out of her butt to get out of the current jam. It undercuts any sense of tension since it’s quickly rectified.Furthermore, the kids not actively striving to be better undermines one of the messages of the book.The reason the Lord of Shadows despises the Orisha is because of a mistake Maya’s father made that resulted in the massacre of his people ie the Dark Bringers. From a certain perspective the villain in this story is actually her father. Such nuance is completely lost as Maya is not encouraged to ever think critically.When she finally does it feels like an afterthought. Like Barron forgot this was supposed to be a theme so she hastily threw it in. As a result when you look closer at it many of the elements to it don’t fit.First off, 60% in is when Maya first considers she might have made a snap judgment about the Dark Bringers. Except it was made clear from the moment she found out the backstory 30% in that the Dark Bringers weren't exclusively bad. She should have known this from the fact that her father was super guilty for his participation in the killings. If the species was all trash then no one would have cared about their deaths. Instead it’s a great shame.Second, every Dark Bringer until they get to the Dark Bringer world is a nondescript, generic bad guy practically twirling their evil mustache. Not one is treated like a three dimensional character. They’re minions first and foremost. How am I supposed to feel sympathy for people who are presented as nothing more than an evil, mindless monolith? The only sympathetic moment - when the kids almost kill a couple of Dark Bringer children and light their farm on fire - is manufactured to kick off the plot thread. The almost farm burning is subsequently milked for all its worth because Barron hasn’t done enough world building to provide other examples of how Dark Bringers deserve respect too.Why didn't Barron have the trio meet ‘normal’ Dark Bringers? Why was so much time wasted on simply getting to the realm? Why wasn’t more time spent exploring the realm? If she wanted us to think of them in a more balanced, complex light we should have observed their society.Third, Eli straight up murders a Dark Bringer after the almost farm burning. They all feel bad momentarily before moving on never to feel bad about it again. The idea that the Dark Bringers aren’t all bad only just got introduced. If Eli was going to kill anyone it should have happened a lot sooner to have time for fallout. It defeats the whole purpose of establishing that Dark Bringers are people (of a sort) too, to immediately have the kids kill one without remorse. If you’re going to do it, at least give them consequences.Her two best friends are annoying and inconsequential. Frankie’s perspective on everything is narrow minded because she filters it all through a scientific lens. She initially doesn’t believe Maya about anything because it can’t be scientifically explained. Even after she can’t help but to believe she still uses science to rationalize every little thing. It’s exhausting since I can’t even technically say she’s wrong when the world isn’t developed enough to argue against her. Eli is unnecessary. Eliminate him, nothing changes whatsoever.Maya, herself, as a character is one note. She’s a slew of different middle grade female protagonists cobbled together. Nothing about her stands out. There was an opportunity to add depth by having her be conflicted regarding her father’s kidnapping since he’d also been lying to her, her whole life only Barron opts out of it in favor of Maya being ridiculously, boringly forgiving. It’s unrealistic she doesn’t have any messy, complicated feelings brewing.Every middle grade book I’ve read in this specific lane has disappointed me lately. It might be time to put this category out to pasture. Or authors could do better. Annoyingly, me letting it go is surely a lot more likely than these types of books getting better. I have Rena Barron’s young adult book on my WTR list. I still plan on reading it though I will admit I am wary now. I’m a completionist so I’ll be reading the sequel eventually. When, is anyone’s guess.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45868801-maya-and-the-rising-dark,Maya and the Rising Dark.txt
Amari and the Night Brothers,"On paper Amari and the Night Brothers is right up my alley. I don't much like urban fantasy compared to 'regular' fantasy, but this essentially promised to take place in a different world entirely so that's close enough to get me excited. I love the idea of a hodge-podge of pure fantastical elements mixed into the paranormal. Fantasy tends to be on the opposite side of the spectrum to Paranormal despite the commonalities in the genres. A Black female protagonist is nothing to sneeze at either.What I got was a big bowl of disappointment.Let me start by admitting some of my discontent does stem from reading a similar book - Nevermoor: The Trials of Morrigan Crowe by Jessica Townsend - recently. That book is a five star and a half read. It was an instant favorite. Therefore, certain issues stood in stark relief by comparison.It's hard not to when Nevermoor does almost everything correctly while this book is only doing competently at best. Nevertheless, the problem wasn't just that I happened to read, in my opinion, a superior book with a comparable concept close to this one. I love middle grade fantasy and I absolutely will read the same fundamental idea back to back no problem. I value originality but it's not the most important thing in the world. The book above all else simply needs to entertain me.In fanfiction, there's a type of story involving reader inserts colloquially known as YN (ie your name). It's exactly what it sounds like: the author puts in a catch all character who the reader can project themselves onto. This isn't limited to fanfiction, of course, lots of young adult books have a veritable blank slate function as their protagonist. I bring up fanfiction here because the thing about fanfiction is that since it's an open source for writing you often get stories written by young people who are just starting out. Amari and the Night Brothers was extraordinarily reminiscent of a YN fic to me.I don't mean that Amari and the Night Brothers is bad because it reads like fanfiction. I have read fanfiction better than many published books. I mean that this book merely fits this particular type of fanfiction to a tee. It's written well enough to be readable, it follows a plot relatively fine, the pacing is decent - yet there’s a kind of hollowness underpinning the whole thing due to the author’s inexperience. This isn't guaranteed for every YN fic, however, I'd wager a majority share these characteristics.Alston is only as descriptive as absolutely necessary. There are no interesting metaphors or analogies or any form of language to make the world sparkle. His prose is uniform and lackluster. The same extends to the characters, who are largely non descript. I was unable to immerse myself because it was difficult to imagine anything with such perfunctory explanations. In YN fics this typically stems from the author being young so they don't have a frame of reference for a lot of things. The limited, cursory form of writing reflects the authors' lack of experience.For example, when Amari's mother buys her a phone it's stated to be 'the newest version'. The newest version of what exactly? An iPhone? An Android? It doesn’t matter because Alston has fulfilled his primary directive of establishing a phone has been purchased. It seems small, but the type of phone a person gets is one of those little things that can reveal a lot about a character in a subtle way.Let me break it down: The actual brand of phone her mother buys would tell the reader how much she’s splurged which in turn tells us how much of this is gift versus practicality. If it was a Firefly phone or an old Nokia brick that would fall more on the side of pragmatism. A Firefly specifically would demonstrate this particularly well as it has very limited capabilities compared to smartphones. Given its limitations it could be argued her mother is overprotective. If it was an iPhone 11 - an iPhone 11 vaguely aligns with the timeline - it would be more of a gift. The newer it is the bigger deal it is as it is a tangible representation of how important Amari getting into the summer camp is to her mother. They don’t have much money yet her mother being willing to buy a phone that costs say $500 would show how much her mother loves her; she would pay a lot of money for a popular phone over one that is merely serviceable. This is good for the narrative as it places pressure on Amari to do well as, from her point of view, her mother is investing money they do not have in this opportunity, thus the stakes are raised.Branching off that last point, there is a severe lack of tension or suspense.Amari never suffers any real setbacks. Going back to my point about YN fics, a large part of YN fics is that everything slides into place with little effort on their part. YN's status as the greatest cannot be challenged too much or else it breaks the immersion. These stories are in essence wish fulfillment. As such very few want to read about YN suffering too much or realistically. YN basically can do whatever YN wants and everybody loves them. People will bend over backwards to accommodate YN, ignoring how strange they may be acting or how little time has passed since they’ve met YN. Those who don’t worship the ground YN walks on are horrible people of little concern. Under these parameters Alston does not have to prove Amari is capable in-text, instead he can merely warp the world around her to force everything in her favor.As per the synopsis Amari is given an illegal supernatural ability. This, of course, puts the whole Bureau into a tizzy. Lucky for Amari there’s a woman whose supernatural ability is that she can scan someone to read their intentions.At 24% into the book this shoots her quest to find her brother in the foot at the starting line. Amari blatantly flaunts the fact that she’s at the camp solely to find her brother. This makes absolutely no sense for Amari to do. Why would she tell these higher-ups in a meeting where they’re trying to decide whether or not to wipe her memory that she’s planning on causing problems by sniffing around? She can’t hide it because of the woman who can read intentions, but then the question becomes why would Alston write in an ability like that in the first place? Where is the fun in her sneaking around when her intentions are made so transparent from the get go? I suppose it doesn’t matter either way since she’s allowed to stay at camp regardless.Following the train of thought, her permission to stay at camp hinges on her being on her best behavior. It is made abundantly clear that people will be watching her. Amari uses her powers uninhibitedly in front of a large group of people twice with no direct consequences. Considering how terrified the Bureau is of her, I’m confused why she was not immediately shipped home. Or at the very least I’m confused why people expressly watching her is a vague threat rather than a concrete obstacle she needs to learn how to avoid.The Bureau has a man detained who is related to her brothers’ disappearance. Amari does not even think for one second of coming up with a plan to sneak in to see him. Instead she directly ASKS to see him. Obviously, they say no. Only for Alston to,a few paragraphs later, backtrack and arrange it so they suddenly need her to do so. Then she leverages this position to get intel. Thus, she did not have to exert herself whatsoever.Amari receives a small lead. It requires her to meet a man who is the head of a different part of the Bureau. She just makes an appointment to see him and is prepared to wait a few days. No clever plan to try to see him sooner or force her way in. I don’t care if it’s unsuccessful, I care that she never even tries. What kind of investigator never pursues a lead or bends a rule or two? Especially as a kid who is supposedly frantic to find her brother. The lack of initiative is infuriating.Amari has to get her phone updated and Elsie sees a private message Amari was keeping secret. Amari immediately caves and tells her about it. Again - and I cannot stress this enough - I don't care if Elsie would know she's lying, what I care about is that Amari doesn'ttry. Amari expending a modicum of effort rather than essentially relying on luck would do wonders for her character. Going in this direction means leaving absolutely no room for friction to potentially take advantage of for interesting interactions later on.Without fail, any time Alston could stir up drama or up the ante he actively chooses to smother it before it can spark.As soon as Amari comes up against a scrape it either swiftly rectifies itself so she doesn’t have to lift a finger or she simply asks. It makes for an utterly uninteresting mystery to solve when there are no clever puzzles or perplexing conundrums or startling twists.At the start of try-outs the teacher starts calling people out. Her gruff demeanor is to let the kids know this program isn’t any walk in the park. She embarrasses one kid by dressing her down for being a glory hound then moves onto Amari. It’s a decent if not predictable set-up for Amari to stand up for herself in front of everyone to make it clear she has a backbone. It’s fairly normal until the teacher precedes to have a private conversation with herin front of the whole class.Amari says she lowers her voice so no one else can hear and that would be acceptable if it was one quick line to let her know she is secretly on Amari’s side. But, no she actually gives her a whole speech that I’m expected to believe a class full of kids is going to disregard. Not to mention the fact that a teacher would never stop a class dead like this to have a serious discussion with a kid. If it’s that serious she would have had her stay afterwards to tell her for this exact reason. It could be a long talk and, if this was the real world, potentially detrimental since other kids could hear personal info.This slides neatly into my YN analogy: the teacher pointedly speaking to Amari in this manner is a totally illogical sequence of events unfolding like it’s completely normal all so YN (Amari) can receive an unnecessary pep talk. YN getting praised is the priority moreso than a realistic depiction of a situation because the purpose, unconsciously or not, is to make the reader feel good about themselves via YN. As such the teacher taking special time to uplift her is presented emotionally first, practically second. The reader is not meant to question how much this stalls the class.The worldbuilding is poor. There is a vibrant supernatural world at Amari’s fingertips yet we spend the entire time trapped in the Bureau and nearly all of Amari’s contact is with other humans. When she does meet another supernatural creature it’s fleeting. I don’t understand why there aren’t more supernatural creature agents. I find it super hard to believe that a community would allow itself to be governed entirely by a non magical police force.The universe is how it is because Alston’s writing is primarily based on utility. Amari’s classes sound super cool based on the titles, but we only attend one or two. The rest wouldn’t move the plot along so they’re glossed over. I can count on one hand the amount of contributory characters Amari comes face to face with and all are inchoate because their presence is dictated entirely by how well they can serve the overarching plot.Her roommate Elsie, a weredragon, is the only non-human she is exposed to for any substantial length of time. Not that this factors into the story at all. Part of Elsie’s arc is that she can’t turn into a dragon for understandable character reasons I don’t want to spoil. But, are there really no cool attributes she could have been given to differentiate her a little bit? Just for fun? She's functionally a human. The only thing that stands out is that she can read moods which I hate due to it being a shortcut to avoid the two characters needing to have real communication.Alston tries to act as if the two are such close friends, but it’s hard not to be when one of the characters has such a huge advantage. It doesn't allow for the friendship to develop organically. It’s actually a faux intimacy to distract from the fact that Elsie is barely a character. She is little more than an encouraging block of wood for Amari to occasionally lean on. When she talks about her classes - which are completely different from Amari’s since she is on a different track - Alston avoids building the environment so it’s ignored. Unlike Amari, she’s plugged into the supernatural world but again we never go anywhere so this doesn’t mean anything.There’s even an occasion where Alston seems to forget this. Amari buys a supernatural magazine that she doesn’t know how to open. Elsie is also perplexed. Except that doesn’t make any sense because if Elsie has been raised in this culture she should know how to open a magazine.Plus, I find it unrealistic that Amari never gets annoyed that Elsie feels comfortable bringing up her emotions before Amari has even parsed them out yet. Elsie might be able to see the emotion but that’s not the same thing as actually interpreting it. Personally, it would worsen some emotions for me to be laid so bare at a moment’s notice. Amari is way too insecure to be vibing like it’s nothing from day one.The book falls apart at the very end. The root of the big conflict is that Amari’s illegal power makes her a bad person because all the people who had her power that came before her used it for evil. Amari needs to make a big decision that reflects on her feelings about her illegal power.Amari was apparently proving peoples’ misconceptions about people with her illegal power wrong. However, as I’ve reiterated several times: Amari goes nowhere, does nothing and talks to no one. So how is she showing anyone anything? If Amari is meant to show the populace just by living her best life that would be fine. She doesn’t actually owe the world anything. If the lesson in the end was you can’t make anyone see what they don’t want to, I wouldn’t be complaining. The problem is that that’snotwhat the goal is. The goal is to inspire others to reconsider their perspective.Alston makes it very clear that the final battle is supposed to be a culmination of Amari’s endeavors for the duration. Unfortunately, there are only two instances where Amari embodies this idea. She makes a grand gesture as her final test to be admitted into the Bureau as a junior agent. Additionally, there is a strawman introduced right before the final test for Amari to convert to her cause. Note: both of the above events happen after the 70% mark.The reason why this does not work is two-fold.First off, Amari's illegal power is related to a serious prejudice in the supernatural world. After it's established that everyone hates her it's left at that - paper thin caricatures who harrumph a lot when showcased but not relevant enough to have an impact. Amari barely explores what her power can do for her or the history behind it. She gets rightfully upset that other people treat her poorly but this doesn't result in a lot of explicit bullying or misbehavior from kids or adults. Most of it is ignoring her unless it's time for specific incidents to segue into the next big event. This hands off approach to her treatment not only undermines the significance of Amari's struggles, it means that Amari has no opportunities to challenge their ignorance.Second, Amari is a stagnant character. She never lies. She never cuts corners. She never cheats. When the idea of misusing her power comes up she recoils immediately thereby closing the door on it before it begins. She has one minor hiccup that feels manufactured because of how overblown the incident is. Her personal failing is insecurity which would be relatable - and admittedly is understandable given the circumstances - if it was not easily fixed through a single conversation with a minor character.I don't mind a kid that does the right thing all the time. As a former rule following kid myself I love a goodie two shoes more than I probably should. It's just that this type of character has no business being in a story where previously conceived notions need to be challenged if she's too straitlaced to do the challenging. There are so many unjust assumptions and policies regarding her power. It is ridiculous that Amari never once has a crisis of faith in regards to her belief in this world. She never considers turning her back on them. She never stops to think that maybe the system is wrong. She never does her own research into the shadowy past. In short, she never develops her own independent idea of what it means to participate in this society.Therefore, the decision she has to make is fundamentally flawed because I do not see a difficult choice for two thoroughly explored, tempting factions Amari is torn between. Amari does not falter in her loyalty. The 'bad side' never stands a chance. There is only an argument to be made in favor of the Bureau by default not by design. I was not convinced that Amari's decision was tough for her as there wasn't a solid foundation laid beforehand. It’s not like Alston didn’t try, but his attempts were half-hearted at best.It's a predictable dispute I’ve seen done well many a time before fumbled in this case by execution. Off the top of my head I can count several books that have a similar concept or themes implemented better than this one - like the aforementioned Nevermoor.At the conclusion, an underground group involving Amari’s power is introduced as a tease for the next book. I believe this was a huge mistake as it was desperately needed to set the stage inthisbook.On a favorable note, I appreciate how Alston made Amari’s race explicitly linked to her feelings of alienation. Being Black often defines your venture into a new space before you’ve even opened your mouth. A mere glance at your skin has already caused you to be written off by a not insignificant number of people. Alston does a decent job of tracing Amari’s isolation in the ordinary outside world to that of the supernatural ostracization. However, I also will say it is usually extremely on the nose.Debuts can be hit or miss, and this falls further under miss. It’s underdeveloped, it’s boring, and it’s generic. It’s written like one of the better options on Wattpad, but that is not saying much. I don’t need every story to be brand spankin’ new or perfect. What I do need is for this story to be the best version of the story it’s trying to tell - this is not that. I’m not going to write Alston off here because I think he shows some promise. I’ll be reading the next book one way or the other so hopefully I’m not wrong to have faith.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53240817-amari-and-the-night-brothers,Amari and the Night Brothers.txt
The Rose and the Thorn,"4.5/5 starsThe cover art toThe Rose and the Thornis atrocious, but let’s not judge a book by its cover.“The right word, said at the right moment, can work magic, he was fond of saying. You merely need to understand power, where it comes from, and the direction it flows.”Two persons genuinely surprised me. First, the cover artist has outdone himself; I thought the cover art he did forThe Riyria RevelationsandThe Crown Towerwas bad already. But no, he has created a masterfully inferior cover art; this is one of the worst cover arts I’ve ever seen. Who the heck are the two dudes in the cover art? That is not Royce; that’s Jean-Ralphio fromParks and Recreation. And that is not Hadrian; that’s Christian Bale, and I’m not sure he realized his left hand will bleed from holding the sword like that. I’ll have to give the benefit of the doubt here, the cover artist probably misheardThe Rose and the ThornasThe Gross and the Thorn, and he successfully nailed it. But enough about that. Despite how much I want a new cover art to grace these books, I’m judging the book based on the content, and the next person that surprised me with this book is obviously Michael Sullivan himself.‘“Because that’s what people do. They help each other. If you saw a man lying in the road with an arrow in him, you’d stop, wouldn’t you?”“Of course… anyone would. A wounded man is easy pickings, unless you could see from your saddle that someone else has already taken his purse.”“What? No! No one would rob a wounded man and leave him to die.”’The Rose and the Thornis the second book inThe Riyria Chroniclesseries. One year has passed since the event ofThe Crown Tower, and upon their arrival back at Medford, Royce and Hadrian found out that their friend has been treated very unkindly. Remember that Royce and Hadrian don’t have many friends. Think about it; Royce and Hadrian becoming a duo is a miracle already. Now, imagine what happens when someone badly treats a rare friend they treasure; you can rest assured that these two will stop at nothing to make sure that the perpetrator received the retribution they deserve. This is undoubtedly another heartwarming and compelling volume about love, friendship, wealth, revenge, destiny, loyalty, and kindness.“Even if you’re doing it for selfish reasons, you’re still helping to save his life. It just goes to show that good can come from helping a stranger, and it proves that the world isn’t so bad after all.”I thought I couldn’t get more invested with these characters, and I couldn’t be more wrong, AGAIN. Entertaining dialogues are one of Sullivan’s main forte as a storyteller, and the banter between Royce and Hadrian continues to be delightful as always. It’s worth noting that unlikeThe Crown Towerwhere most of the story was told through Hadrian and Gwen’s POV, inThe Rose and the ThornSullivan included more POV characters. Also, more important characters fromThe Riyria Revelationsare here in their younger state. Initially, I did feel a bit impatient because I wanted more of Hadrian’s POV; this is more of a Royce and Reuben’s book, and the Riyria duo didn’t have as many appearances as I preferred in the first half of the novel. Fortunately, Reuben’s origin story ended up winning me over, too. The characterizations in this prequel series totally outshoneThe Riyria Revelations, and I wish I had read this prequel series first before readingThe Riyria Revelations. The two books that I’ve read so far have given so much extra depth and background to the characters ofThe Riyria Revelations; this was especially evident for Hadrian, Royce, Gwen, and Reuben.“In Royce’s eyes she could see the pain of struggling to survive reflected back. They were the same, two pieces of wood from different worlds but whose grain lined up, and it was then she knew she was falling in love.”I mean, wow. With context, the passage above hits powerfully. I can’t believe Sullivan could write as good as that. I guess it shouldn’t come as a surprise that this prequel series is more well-written thanThe Riyria RevelationsbecauseThe Riyria Chroniclesis written after it. However, for an unplanned series, it’s astounding that it never felt like it. The plotting and character’s development felt like Sullivan has planned this since the start ofThe Riyria Revelations. The story in this book takes place eleven years before the events inTheft of Swords. And as I said, Arista, Alric, Albert, Reuben, and other characters and names we’ve seen inThe Riyria Revelationsmade their appearances here; the progression felt so well-realized and related to the main series.“One day you'll remember this moment. It will have faded to a mere wisp, a ghost of a long-forgotten past, but it will return to you.”Admittedly, the resolution to the conflict ofThe Rose and the Thornfelt a bit underwhelming to me;The Crown Towerhas a memorably stronger wrap-up. But I want to make it clear that Sullivan shows great growth in his storytelling. Two things that bothered me several times inThe Riyria Revelationswere the foreshadowing and the lack of Royce’s actions despite his infamous name.-On the first point, I found that Sullivan’s foreshadowing felt too obvious and predictable it felt like spoiling its own plot twist. Sullivan is much better at writing foreshadowing and prophecies to deepen the tension of the narrative now.-On the second point, it’s a bit unbelievable how often people feared Royce, but we seldom get to see him displayed his abilities. Well, I certainly got what I wanted in the prequel series so far.The Rose and the Thornwas darker and more violent thanThe Riyria Revelations, and it felt good to finally reallyseehim in action.“If a bug bites you, you don’t bite it back… You crush the life out of the thing so it never bothers you again. And if you do that to an insect that can’t cause any serious harm, why would you do any less to an enemy who will almost certainly come back and kill if you don’t?I still likedThe Crown Towerslightly more, but I continue to enjoy this series immensely. BothThe Crown TowerandThe Rose and the Thornjust further established my point that this prequel series—on a first-time read experience—might be shaping up to be superior toThe Riyria Revelations; at least on a single installment and feel-good basis. I don’t think theThe Riyria Chronicleswill ever reach the level of overarching satisfaction thatThe Riyria Revelationshas, and I’m totally okay with that. Despite a few minor issues, I had so much fun readingThe Rose and the Thorn; I smiled a lot, and I finished reading this novel in two days. That’s a rare occurrence for me now due to how busy I am this year. I’ve read so many fantasy books, and that urge of always wanting to continue reading a book is getting rarer now. But similar toThe Crown Tower,The Rose and the Thorngave me that urge again. I’m looking forward to reading the next installment,The Death of Dulgath, in August. I’m trying to prolong my read-through of this comforting series that’s starting to feel like home to me, and I’m sad that there are only two published books remaining for me to read. Until then…“The place was sacred to him—something he didn’t realize until that moment. The room was a sanctuary of kindness and comfort. He’d stayed there only a couple months, but coming back he wondered if what he was feeling could be what others felt about places they called home.”You can order the book from:Book Depository (Free shipping)You can findthisand the rest of my reviews atNovel Notions| I also have aBooktube channelSpecial thanks to my Patrons onPatreonfor giving me extra support towards my passion for reading and reviewing!My Patrons: Alfred, Alya, Annabeth, Ben, Blaise, Devin, Diana, Dylan, Edward, Ellen, Gary, Hamad, Helen, Jimmy Nutts, Joie, Luis, Lufi, Melinda, Mike, Miracle, Nicholas, Sarah, Seth, Shaad, Summer, Wendy, Wick, Zoe.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17163514-the-rose-and-the-thorn,The Rose and the Thorn.txt
Fairy Tale,"I’d heard of curses—the storybooks are full of them—but this was the first time I’d seen one in action.--------------------------------------You never know where the trapdoors are in your life, do you?Once Upon a Time, Stephen King decided to write a fairy tale. So, bring in some Brothers Grimm, Disney, Mother Goose, add in some H.P. Lovecraft, for good measure, and plenty more, stir for a good long while in the cauldron that is SKs brain, and “Poof!” There it appears. Being Stephen King, the book is over 600 pages, so not exactly Mother Goose length.I love all the stuff that Robert E. Howard, Conan the Barbarian and some of the characters in the Edgar Rice Burroughs books, who would find these strange deserted cities, monsters and things. I thought it’s kinda like fairy tales. And I started to kinda get interested in that, and I thought maybe I could combine those two things, Maybe I could take the whole fairy tale riff.- from the Losers Club interviewCharlie Reade is a pretty good kid. But he hit into a bit of bad luck. He was seven when Mom made the mistake of walking across a local bridge on an icy night. Soon after, dad started drinking in earnest, managed to survive in his job for three years, but was ultimately let go. After months of ever worse drinking by his dad, Charlie did something that was alien to him.Stephen King- image from The Financial TimesHe prayed to God to help his dad. Help arrives when Charlie is ten in the form of a former workmate introducing pop to AA. Feeling that he must hold up his end of the deal, Charlie is ever on the lookout for the task that he thinks God wants him to take care of. Years later the day arrives, and Charlie, seventeen now, steps up, saving the life of a local crank who had had a bad accident. Mr. Bowditch had more than just a foul temper and a creepy old house. He had an old German Shepherd, Radar, who loved him dearly. Charlie takes on the task of caretaking Radar and Mr. Bowditch, and fast friendships develop. Bowditch had another thing of some significance, a shed covering the entrance to a hidden world.Mr. Bowditch’s house is referred to as “The Psycho House” by the locals- from the bookThere comes a time (about 35% of the way in) when it is necessary for Charlie to brave that journey and the story takes off, as Charlie and Radar head down and out of this world. There is a sundial down there that can reverse-age the now-beloved dog. Charlie is determined to save her.…these books, particularly the Edgar Rice Burroughs books, like John Carter of Mars…they’re supposed to have this hero who’s like, muscular, you know, he played football in college and at the same time he’s got a brain, he’s handsome and got a cleft chin and all that good stuff and I thought I’d like to write a character like that. I’d like to write a character, who’s big, tough, tall, strong, who’s smart, but I want to give him a dose of reality. If he’s a kid, a younger man, who as a younger kid put dogshit on a bad teacher’s windshield, and glued somebody’s ignition shut. In other words I wanted him to have an anti-Disney kind of thing in there.- from the Losers Club interviewKing succeeds in giving Charlie some dark sides, but he also gives him a large dose of shame to balance it out.Fairy Talefollows the familiar Campbellian structure of theHero’s Journeymonomyth, in which a “hero” goes on an adventure, leaving our pedestrian plane to take on challenges in a supernatural world, usually one below ours, engages in victorious battle, and returns home wiser and more powerful than when he or she left, with a newly enhanced ability to help others.Once down below, in a world called Empis, Charlie encounters many characters who would be quite comfortable in traditional western fairy tales. It is a magical place, as one might expect. There are multiple dealings with Rumpelstiltskin-type characters, (names figure very large here) royalty disguised as commoners, sentient non-human life, (including a cricket who might remind one of another boy on a journey) and a general bleakness darkening the land. I was reminded of C.S. Lewis’s Narnia series opener, in which that troubled land was described as being “Always winter but never Christmas.” More immediate correlations might be to King’s ownThe Talisman,The Dark Tower, andFrom a Buick 8,Rose Madder, andLisey’s Story, which all feature cross-world portals.Charlie must face and overcome perils in this new (to him) world, in order to achieve his goal of saving Radar. But, Charlie is somehow seen by the locals as some sort of a savior, a prince. (which again reminded me of Peter in Narnia) Charlie finds this odd (who, me?) but also feels a need to help out, so does what he can. Adventure ensues, as does a relentless, and very fun series of references to fairy tales of diverse sorts. King finds his fairy tales in various places. TCM flicks are among them, Niietzsche, Dickens, Kipling, Mark Twain and Thackery, Ray Bradbury, Jung, Lovecraft, Game of Thrones, Piers Anthony, and others.I tried to put in every goddam fairy tale I could think, including Ariel, the mermaid from the Disney film.- from the Losers Club interviewThe Wizard of Ozis a particular favorite, as there are multiple references, including an emerald city, fields of poppies, and a bit on the importance of shoes.Radar and Charlie- from the bookThe overall structure of the novel is a frame. Chapter one is Charlie telling us that he is going to tell us a tale--so we know that he will survive--and ends with Charlie letting us know that he is a twenty-something teacher of a seminar on Myth and Fairy Tales. Each chapter is introduced by a drawing of an element to come. These are delightful, adding to the fairy-tale feel of the novel.Gripes - Charlie keeps reminding us that he is speaking and hearing in a language other than English, a language that he seems to be absorbing by osmosis. Once the initial leap of faith had been requested, and presumably performed, these repetitions only served to remind us over and over again of that leap. Once would have been sufficient. And at 608 pages, it was definitely a bit long. I did not keep track of all the fairy tale, or other literary or filmic references sprinkled across the book, but they are legion, and spotting them offers its own form of satisfaction. Those who have read more of King’s work than I, which will be many of you, will pick up references to other King work that I missed (The Cujo reference is not missable). A weapon used here features large in a King seriesThere are some passing contemplations in the tale that rise above the simple experience of the plot. In one, Charlie wonders whether it is Empis that is the magical place or the world he was born into, offering some intriguing examples of why one might think that. There are more.There are familiar Kingian elements. A young man, or boy, forms a friendship with an older man. The man has significant secrets, but teaches his mentee what he can. There is a missing parent, a young person taking on adult responsibilities, issues with alcoholism, other worlds that exist in parallel to ours, coming to terms with our darker side, and more. One primary Kingian element that is particularly appropriate here is that this is a love story. Boy meets dog, and it is love that conquers all. It is also a love letter to story, the stories King read as a kid, the stories he has continued to inhale as an adult, whether of the fairy tale, horror, science fiction or adventure sort, whether taken in from the pages of a book or from screens, large and small. We as individuals are the stories we tell about ourselves.Our culture is defined by the stories we tell and repeat about our values and history. Story is as important to us as breathing and eating. Many of the fairy tales that King incorporates here are not, like the ones we grew up on, intended for bedtime reading to children. Mother Goose might not feel entirely comfortable with the darker pieces that King has imported into his magical kingdom (not exactly the happiest place on Earth), particularly the Lovecraftian ones, but I bet the Brothers Grimm (before Disney got its paws on their tales) would be all good with it. Whether your fairy tales begin with “Once upon a time or “A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away…” we have always been taken with stories that transport us to other realms, whether those places are characterized by magic, darkness, bizarre landscapes, alien beings, advanced technology, or some other form ofother-ness. I can’t say that once you read this you will live happily ever after but it may show you some roads you can travel to find your way there on your own, or even with a friend or two. Consider yourself transported.As a kid, I liked all the stories by Robert E. Howard, and I liked Edgar Rice Burroughs. One of the greatest things is The Land That Time Forgot. The story starts with a narrator who finds a manuscript on the beach. The narrator says, to you, the reader, read five pages and I will be forgotten. To me, that’s what fiction’s all about. Particularly fiction where a lot of stuff happens and where you’re kind of on an adventure, and you say to yourself, What I would like to do is for my readers to forget all their problems for a while, and just relax and get totally immersed in the story and get carried away to a different world.- from the Losers Club interviewThe novel has been optioned by Paul Greengrass to make a feature film, but it certainly seems better suited to a mini-series. I guess we will see.Review posted - 05/12/23Publication date – 9/06/22This review will be cross-posted on my site,Coot’s Reviews, soon.

The Wisdom of Crowds,"ARC provided by the publisher—Gollancz—in exchange for an honest review.Joe Abercrombie is a genius storyteller.The Wisdom of Crowdsis one of the best books of the year, a masterfully crafted conclusion toThe Age of Madnesstrilogy.“What is the point of gathering knowledge if one does not pass it on? What is the point of growing old if one does not try to shape the future?”For years I’ve mentioned theLast Argument of Kingsas Joe Abercrombie’s best book; it is a masterwork in grimdark fantasy, in my opinion. For years I’ve said Abercrombie probably won’t be able to come up with a novel that matched—or topped—theLast Argument of Kings. Today, that unbending situation changed; I’m gratified to say that Abercrombie has done it.The Wisdom of Crowds, the last book inThe Age of Madnesstrilogy, is up there with theLast Argument of Kingsas the best book inThe First Law Worldand his career. And I dare say it’s indeed his most well-written book so far. Last week, I did an interview with Joe Abercrombie on my YouTube channel, and it is one of my most treasured experiences as a book reviewer. I hope to have the chance to do that again in the future becauseThe Wisdom of Crowdsis one of the best books I’ve read, and I have some burning questions regarding the revelations unveiled in this novel. Anyway, that’s for the future, now let’s begin with the review.“Sometimes, the only way to improve something is to destroy it, so it can be rebuilt better… Sometimes, to change the world, we must first burn it down.”Chaos, fury, and destruction; this is howThe Wisdom of Crowdsstarts, and it’s also how the narrative progresses. The Great Change is here, and our beloved main characters—voluntarily or not—are all caught in its sweeping madness. Abercrombie didn’t waste time shifting the story and characters into their crimson path. Right from their respective first chapter, everyone’s plunged into this uncontrollable vicious frenzy. If you’ve readA Little HatredandThe Trouble with Peace, then you’ll know what the chapter “Little People” signifies. Unlike the previous books, the first out of two “Little People” inThe Wisdom of Crowdshappened in chapter 3; it is that soon.“How could one man keep his oath when everyone else was breaking theirs, after all? An army very much relied on unity of purpose.”From the beginning to the end, not a single page in this novel ever felt dull to me. I know that every author writes differently, but I do wish more authors write and structure their series the way Abercrombie or Michael Sullivan did with their trilogy. For those of you who don’t know, Abercrombie finished writing the entireThe First Lawtrilogy first before he focused on polishing one book at a time. This method was reimplemented forThe Age of Madnesstrilogy, and same with theLast Argument of Kings, this kind of storytelling planning and structure allow Abercrombie to fill the pages of his concluding volume with an incredibly engaging—and believable—revelations and narrative.The Wisdom of Crowdsproved thatThe Age of Madnesstrilogy has some of his most meticulous plotting so far; revelations are done in abundance, and they never felt out of place. This is a novel—or trilogy—that successfully captured a myriad of relatable themes and character’s actions such as freedom, betrayals, loyalties, conspiracies, leadership, responsibilities, survival, politics, war, ambitions, and the price of progress.“Have you been outside lately? Wisdom is not at a premium, madness is the fashion, the balance sheets are all torn up and the friends that were assets have become liabilities… Threats for tomorrow don’t cut very deep when today is so damn threatening.”I won’t lie; as a long-time and diehard fan ofThe First Law World, there’s always a part of me that feels gleeful when characters or backgrounds attained from reading the previous six novels plus one collection of short stories appeared. This isn’t to say that I didn’t love or care about the new main characters of this trilogy; if that were the case, I doubt I’ll be giving each book in this trilogy a 5 stars rating. However, prior to readingThe Wisdom of Crowds, I never felt like the new main characters could compete with Abercrombie’s previous main characters. Again, I was gladly proven wrong. I’m being truthful when I say there are no characters inThe First Law Worldthat I love more than Logen Ninefingers or Sand dan Glokta; they’re too iconic and unforgettable for me. But I’ll be lying if I say that I didn’t immensely enjoy reading the journey of Rikke, Orso, Leo, Savine, Broad, Vick, and Clover. They’re not Logen Ninefingers, and they’re not Sand dan Glokta; they’re never meant to be, and that’s completely okay. By this concluding installment, I personally think these new main characters—especially Rikke, Orso, Leo, and Savine—have earned their spot as some of the most well-written characters in fantasy. I mean, Rikke and Savine have both became some of my favorite characters, too. Say one thing for Abercrombie, say that his level of characterizations is unmatched in grimdark fantasy.“The past has never interested me. For better or worse it is done, and set, and littered with disappointments as a battlefield is littered with the dead. But the future is a ploughed field, full of potential. The future we can twist into wonderful shapes.”I never thought I would end up caring for all the characters in this trilogy this much, but now that I finished it, I felt like there’s a gap inside of me that won’t be filled until Abercrombie write more characters for me to feel invested in. The main characters underwent tremendous character development inThe Wisdom of Crowds. The lawless chaos and savage circumstances they’re in have pushed all of them towards becoming a better or cruel version of the person they were. Almost all the main characters realistically changed from their first appearance inA Little Hatred. Wishes buy nothing, and good luck is always in limited supply. Alliances constantly shifted, betrayals and tough decisions have to be unflinchingly executed in order to survive. I loved reading the character’s developments and the conclusion to their story; some made me surprisingly happy and satisfied, and some depressed me. This is an entry inThe First Law World, after all, and you have to be realistic about these things.“It’s a comfort, telling yourself there’s some big right thing out there. That you could seek some wise old bastard in the mountains who’s got the answer. Then there’d be no need for doubts and regrets… But far as I can tell it ain’t that simple. Right things, wrong things, well… it’s all a matter of where you stand. Every choice is good for some, bad for others. And once you’re chief, you can’t just do what’s good for you, or those you love. You have to find what’s best for most. Worst for fewest.”The action sequences inThe Wisdom of Crowds, once again—I know I sound like a broken record here—established Abercrombie as one of the two best close-quarter combat scenes writers; the other author being John Gwynne. As I mentioned at the beginning of this review,The Wisdom of Crowdsstarted with an explosive bang, but it felt relatively small compared to the third and final act of the novel. The end of the second act was pulse-pounding, and it seamlessly transitioned into the non-stop barrage of mayhem and devastations—emotionally and physically—of the final act. It was all so relentlessly brilliant and insane; the immersion I got from reading Abercrombie’s compelling dialogues and battle scenes are vivid and rare to find in other books. Having read so many fantasy books now, it’s getting harder for me to feel like I’m inside a battle scene with the characters experiencing the glory, terrors, and brutal bloodbath. And readingThe Wisdom of Crowdshas all these immersion effects on me.“The sad truth is, men love to follow a man other man fear… Makes them feel fearsome, too. We tell the odd fond story of the good men. The straight edges. Your Rudd Threetrees, your Dogmen. But it’s the butchers men love to sing of. The burners and the blood-spillers. Your Cracknut Whirruns and your Black Dows. Your Bloody-Nines. Men don’t dream of doing the right thing, but of ripping what they want from the world with their strength and their will.”The Wisdom of Crowdsis, at the moment, the peak of quality in Abercrombie’s prose. It’s unbelievable, but it’s true; Abercrombie has written more than ten novels now, and he somehow keeps getting better and better with each book he wrote. It’s so astounding to me. “Better to do it than live with the fear of it” that’s penned inThe Blade Itselfremains as one of the important mottos I use to motivate me in my daily life. And in this novel, I highlighted 36 passages. No kidding; there were so many well-crafted sentences and passages I wish I could share with you all, but I’ll leave those for you to find out for yourself.“History is not the story of battles between right and wrong, but between one man’s right and another’s. Evil is not the opposite of good. It is what we call another man’s notion of good when it differs from ours.”Lastly, before I end this review, I’ve mentioned and praise the hell out of Abercrombie’s trademark skill in writing magnificent characterizations, dialogues, battle scenes, and all the grim and dark content. But there’s one more trademark of Abercrombie’s prose to mention: humor.The Wisdom of Crowdsis the darkest novel in the trilogy, but this doesn’t mean it’s deficient in its humor. I can’t believe how many times I laughed out loud reading this book; I’m pretty sure most of them were during scenes I shouldn’t laugh about, too. Seriously, there was a chapter involving Clover and Downside that made me laugh out loud. And believe me when I say that I rarely laugh when I’m reading a novel. But that’s the thing; the superb characterizations and humor are what separated and elevated Abercrombie from other grimdark fantasy authors. Amidst the character’s bloody ambitions, ruthless violence, and horrific tragedy, Abercrombie’s cunning capability to insert dark humor at the right—or inappropriate—moment and time made the pacing in his books so captivating.“Don’t matter how savage a face you show the world, few men dare look the Great Leveller in the eye once he comes calling.”Following a comparable contrasting fashion Abercrombie employed inThe First Lawtrilogy, Abercrombie started and concludedThe Age of Madnesssimilarly. The first chapter inThe Blade Itselfis called “The End,” and the last chapter in theLast Argument of Kingsis called “The Beginning.” The first chapter inA Little Hatredis titled “Blessings and Curses”, while the last chapter ofThe Wisdom of Crowdsis titled “Curses and Blessings.” And when it comes to reading Abercrombie’s books, this title couldn’t be more apt. It’s a blessing to have read every book inThe First Law World, and it’s also a curse to have read them all.Same with theLast Argument of Kingswritten by the same connoisseur,The Wisdom of Crowdshas joined the same esteemed rank of fantasy masterpieces. This is the end ofThe Age of Madnesstrilogy, but I doubt this will mark the end ofThe First Law World. The ending showed glimpses of super exciting things to come in the future of this world. But if this somehow ended up being the end, I truly don’t mind. I’m an extremely happy and satisfied reader to have read all the available nine novels and one collection of short stories inThe First Law World. The entirety ofThe First Law World—The First Lawtrilogy, the standalone trilogy, andThe Age of Madnesstrilogy—is the greatest grimdark fantasy series that I’ve read.

Keeper of Enchanted Rooms,"In a Nutshell:All things bright and beautiful, some creatures great and small, many things wise and wonderful – the author included them all. Loved it!Story Synopsis:1846. Thirty-one year old Merritt Fernsby, who is estranged from his family since more than a decade, gets a shock when he learns that his grandmother has left him a remote estate named Whimbrel House. This property has been vacant for more than a century, but Merritt, who doesn’t really have an alternative, is happy to move in. This is only until he realises that his new house has locked him in and has no intention of ever letting him out.Unbeknownst to Merritt, Hulda Larkin, a valuable employee of the ‘Boston Institute for the Keeping of Enchanted Rooms’ (BIKER!), has been assigned Whimbrel House in order to ascertain its magical propensity and calm down its aggression. When she arrives, Merritt is relieved. However, they both soon realise that their residence has far more secrets than they initially assumed, and the dangers to them might not come from the house alone.The story comes to us in a limited third person perspective of various characters.Where the book worked for me:😍 The prologue set in 1818, London is chilling, and took me in a very different direction to what ultimately occurs. Love it when a prologue is utilised well rather than simply leaking a scene from further in the book.😍 The two main characters are charming. Awkward to begin with, Merritt and Hulda grew on me as the chapters progressed. As both of them are in their thirties, it is funny to see them so clumsy and almost juvenile around each other, but the author has written the reasons for this so well that it doesn’t jar. Hulda’s strong façade and her underlying vulnerability make her the perfect titular character.😍 Baptiste and Beth. Such memorable secondary characters within their limited roles! I’d have loved to see more of them.😍 Owein. Owein is like THE reason to read the book. Can’t tell you more though I am bursting with comments about him. (I even Googled the correct pronunciation of his name so that he sticks in my head the right way. I hope he comes in book two as well.)(Psst… I realise I have three separate bullet points just for the characters, but trust me – they have earned their spots on this list.)😍 The romance – just as I like it. Slow, steady, organic, clean. It’s a connection based on alike minds than on attractive bodies. Gimme more of this!😍 So many humorous scenes! I laughed quite a few times and even ended the book with a big grin on my face. There are also a fair number of touching scenes, which show the vulnerable side of the characters. The author balances fun and seriousness nicely.😍 While the pacing of the book ranged between medium to slow, I never felt tempted to speed-read. The writing isn’t decorative but is charming enough to appeal with its simplistic style. Hulda’s “dictionary-style” language is written and utilised wonderfully in the plot without making it seem odd.😍 There's a list of magic terms at the start of the book. While most meanings are guessable if you know their meanings in English, it's worth going through the list as they come up regularly in the plot. There’s also a blueprint of Whimbrel House. Appreciate both these inclusions.Where the book could have worked better for me:😐 The antagonist was dangerous but this character’s potential wasn’t used to the extent possible. There could have been so much more danger added to this arc, especially during the finale. (He still creeped me out though!)😐 Some things are left hinted at but unexplained. Though these don’t affect the comprehension per se, they did leave me a curious cat.It took me ten days to complete this book because I have had a crazy hectic week. Usually, when books take more than 3-4 days of my time, I start losing my interest in them. Not with this one though. Not once was I bored! If I had read this at some other time of the year, I am sure I would have binge-read it from start to end. It has its minor flaws, but the memorable characters, the innovative storyline, and the smooth writing style all ensured that this was a solid read for me.Strongly recommended to lovers of historical fantasies.4.5 stars.My thanks to 47North and NetGalley for the DRC of “Keeper of Enchanted Rooms”. This review is voluntary and contains my honest opinion about the book. I can’t wait to get to the sequel!The book is also available on Kindle Unlimited.———————————————Connect with me through:My Blog|The StoryGraph|Facebook|Twitter",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60596112-keeper-of-enchanted-rooms,Keeper of Enchanted Rooms.txt
The Ninth Rain,"ILOVEtales like these. There were legendary wars many years ago where good prevailed, but no-one really remembers what really happened and now there are endless mysteries and the possibility of having to face an ancient enemy yet again.Before you carry on reading, I feel the need to say that I have detailed most of the history leading up to the present day of the story below. I did this for two reasons:1 - Because it is such a fascinating history and I think this serves as an excellent hook for a story by an author that is not yet widely read, but should be.2- Because it took me a while to get into this story, but I knew the author would deliver in the end and I do not want you to start and give up if you are not familiar with the author.So, if you prefer gathering these bits and pieces of the background that are doled out sparingly through the book as it was written, and are happy to give this book a try, skip the spoiler below.If you are unsure though, give it a read. I do not believe it spoils any of the story. If you are like me you will likely forget most of what is in this review anyway before reading the book so this serves only as enticement for the TBR pile. It already convinced my GF to read this! BTW - the author's first series is great too and you should check that out!The Copper PromiseThe Iron GhostThe Silver TideThe not-that-spoilery-history-backstory-spoiler.Well that was a mouth full! -Once, before their fall, Eborans were respected and feared by all mankind. They were the most beautiful beings on Sarn. Superior to humans in almost every way, many believed them immortal.When the Jure’lia, a hive minded alien species, first attacked, mankind threw all their might against them for the horrors these beings brought with them were almost unimaginable. But humans had no answer to the utter destruction these invaders visited upon Sarn. These Worm People, as they would come to be known, would have consumed everything in their path unopposed were it not for the ferocious fighting of the Eborans and the assistance of their tree god Ygseril. In the hour of Sarn’s greatest need Ygseril brought forth the First Rain and delivered the mythical creatures, magnificent warbeasts of every size and shape, which would defeat the Worm People time and again.The war with the Jure’lia spanned many years. Whenever they were defeated, they would disappear back to where they came from and would not be seen for many years before once again descending from the skies and attacking , bringing forth a new assault in their attempt to consume all. Ygseril would birth a new Rain with every invasion to help repel the invaders, until eventually, during the Eight Rain, the Jure’lia Queen gathered her forces and made a massive assault on the home of the Eborans and their tree god.The Jure’lia were defeated, but through the ages all knowledge of what exactly happened was lost. What is known is that the Jure’lia all died at once, their giant ships plummeted from the sky and crashed all over Sarn.‘The Eighth Rain, when the last war-beasts were born!’ Louis stared up at the vast breadth of the trunk looming above them, a smile on his round, honest face. ‘The last great battle. My dad said that the Eboran warriors wore armour so bright no one could look at it, that they rode on the backs of snowy white griffins, and their swords blazed with fire. The great pestilence of the Jure’lia queen and the worm people was driven back and her Behemoths were scattered to pieces.’While a huge victory for humans and Eborans, the fallout from the battle was disastrous. Wherever the ships of the Jure’lia violently met their end, some device or other machination of the defeated force caused a sort of infection or disease that corrupted the very place these vessels found their final resting place in. This ever-spreading corruption not only tainted vegetation, but also animals, resulting in monstrous abominations.…what it had been, or what its ancestors had been before it had been worm-touched, she did not know. Something like a bear, perhaps; it was bulky, with a thick midsection and four short but powerful legs, and a long, blocky head. But instead of fur it was covered in pale, fleshy pouches of skin, which shivered and trembled as it moved, and Noon could see four circular black eyes along its head, clustered together and oddly spider-like. Its mouth, when it opened its jaws to roar again, was pink and wet and lined with hundreds of yellow needle-like teeth.Attempts were made to get rid of the remains of these ships, but proved mostly impossible as the death tolls from these attempts were too high. Soon after the vessels crashed, dangerous beings called parasite spirits started inhabiting the areas close to and around these wrecks and would kill anyone they came in contact with. Impervious to weapons apart from Winnow-forged steel, they would roam seemingly aimlessly and kill anyone they came in contact with, with many a victim turned inside out.She didn’t take her eyes from the parasite spirit. ‘If we can drive it back outside of the village, perhaps we can get a proper look at it.’ But it was too late. As they arrived, the spirit was bending down over the hapless Fera, who was still thrusting his pitchfork at it. Long tapered fingers closed over him – Vintage was struck briefly by how it looked like a child peering at a new bug on the ground – and then Fera was falling apart. He screamed as his body was unzipped, and Vintage saw a gout of blood and other fluids hit the dirt. The long transparent fingers were still moving though, and her stomach twisted as the man’s skin rolled back like a carpet being peeled away from a floor.The direst consequence however, of the defeat of the Jurelian Queen and her people, was the death of Ygseril in the final battle. The tree god had delivered his final Rain and so begun the end of the Eborans. For while the humans believed Eborans to be immortal, their everlasting youth and health was derived from drinking the sap of Ygseril which they were now denied of. Eborans started slowly wasting away, until discovering that human blood was a suitable, if not nearly as potent replacement for the sap they so needed. What followed became known as the Carrion Wars, which at the height of it saw Eborans slaughter humans and drinking blood from their still warm corpses in the middle of the battlefields. Before things could get even worse though, what the Eborans believed to be their saving grace, became their eternal curse. A terrible, incurable disease, born of the drinking of human blood, befell these Eborans. They started dying slow and agonizing deaths and before long the Eboran population was decimated, with only a few Eborans escaping this fate. Reviled by humans, and as the last of their kind, they slowly disappeared until most people had only ever heard of them in stories, first as saviors and then as villains.The plot of the book follows three different characters whose stories are destined to be intertwined.A rich, inquisitive adventurer, called Vintage.A Fell-Witch, called Noon.And one of the last living Eborans, called Tormalin.Vintage and her hired muscle, Tormalin set out to explore and gather information about the wreckage of the downed ships left behind by the Jure’lia and along the way are joined by Noon, a fell-witch recently escaped from the Winnowery (They are a cult-like group who believe that fell-witches are evil and should be imprisoned for life in order to protect society from their powers. Yep, Noon has the gift of Winnowfire). An unlikely alliance is formed, and as they travel to these sites and start exploring the secrets of the Jure’lia, they find mysteries wrapped within deeper mysteries. Before long, they realize that things might not be as they seem and that the threat of the Jure’lia might not be as confined to the history books as they would like it to be.As stated earlier, I really liked this book, but that page turning fever that overcomes me when a story is unputdownable did not manifest itself until I had read quite a solid chunk. (Where the three main characters start their journey together.) Once there though, I was completely immersed and had a fantastic time. As with the Copper Cat trilogy, the author’s characters are wonderfully compelling creations who were fun to journey with. The story, once it hooked me, was enthralling, and I feel it is really going to shine in the next two books as the amount of worldbuilding Jen Williams had to do in this one was significant. It was well worth it though as this is a rich and vast world that we have been gifted and I can hardly wait to get my hands on the next installment.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29758013-the-ninth-rain,The Ninth Rain.txt
A Little Hatred,"I have a Booktube channel now! Subscribe here:https://www.youtube.com/petrikleoARC provided by the publisher—Gollancz—in exchange for an honest review.Grim, dark, fun, and glorious;A Little Hatredis irrefutably worth the wait.Let me begin by saying that although this is a new series in theFirst Law Worldand you can technically start your journey into this world here, it’s quite mandatory to read at leastThe First Lawtrilogy in order to fully appreciate the intricacies of this book; even better if you’ve also readBest Served ColdandThe Heroes. ReadingA Little Hatredwithout knowledge of the previous books would be a similar experience to reading Pierce Brown’sIron Goldwithout reading his previous three books or reading Robin Hobb’sTawny Mantrilogy without readingFarseer trilogyfirst. Do yourself a favor and make sure you readThe First Lawtrilogy first before you startA Little Hatred, I even binge reread the entire trilogy to make sure that I can start this book with refreshed information. Make some time for it, not only it’s a brilliant trilogy, but you’ll also be doing a huge disservice to the book and most of all your reading experience if you don’t do it. On to the actual review now.“Nothing like being wanted, is there? Wanted by someone you want. Always seems like magic, that something can feel so good but cost nothing.”Red Countrywas first published on October 2012; it’s been seven years since Abercrombie released a novel within hisFirst Law Worldseries.A Little Hatredis the first book inThe Age of Madnesstrilogy by Joe Abercrombie; chronologically this is the eight—seventh if you excludeSharp Ends anthology—installment in hisFirst Law Worldseries. Honestly,A Little HatredandDark Ageby Pierce Brown—which I’ll read after I post this review—are two of my most anticipated books of the year; to say that I’m excited about reading these books are a huge understatement. It gladdens me wholeheartedly to say thatA Little Hatredsuccessfully exceeded my high expectations, to say the least.The story inA Little Hatredtakes place roughly 30 years after the end ofLast Argument of Kings, that’s 15 years after the end ofRed Country. Many years have passed and with it, the world has entered a new age: the industrial revolution, it’s a time of innovations, progress, technologies, and commerce. Despite the arrival of a new age, fans of the series have nothing to be scared of, everything that’s familiar and awesome aboutFirst Law Worldwas evidently easy to find in this book. Times have changed, but money, politics, power, and bloody war remained as the central driving themes of the story; told in his trademarked gritty, at times humorous, and dark storytelling style, Abercrombie once again tells a compelling story that shows how good or bad are most of the times decided merely by different perspectives and which side you stand on.“Believe it or not, we all want what’s best. The root o’ the world’s ills is that no one can agree on what it is.”Abercrombie is pretty well known for his well-realized and memorable characters, there’s no shortage of them in the series so far: Logen Ninefingers, Sand dan Glokta, Jezal dan Luthar, Bayaz, Collem West, Nicomo Cosca, Caul Shivers, Dogman, Black Dow, The Feared, Bremer dan Gorst, and Monza Murcatto to name a few. InA Little Hatred, we follow the perspectives of a new cast of memorable characters. One way or another, almost all of the perspective characters were related to characters that have appeared before in the series. Familiar faces and names do appear quite a lot; there are so much depth and complexity in the background of the characters and world-building that’s impossible to appreciate if you jump into this immediately. For example, even after three decades have passed in the world, the legend of the Bloody-Nine’s glory still triumphed in the North; many warriors admire his deeds and try their best to follow his footsteps. Also, without entering spoiler territory, for those of you who’ve read the first trilogy, you should know by now who the main despicable villain of this series is. He’s back again, and rest assured he brings havoc, treachery, and maximum manipulations with his arrival.“Now all a man’s worth is how much work can be squeezed from him. We’re husks to be scraped out and tossed away. We’re cogs in the big machine.”The new cast of characters was fantastic to read. InA Little Hatred, we mostly follow the perspectives of seven characters: Rikke, Leo, Savine, Orso, Vic, Broad, and Clover. Every single POV was imbued with a distinctive voice that captivated me. I honestly have a hard time deciding which new perspective I loved most within this book. Almost halfway through the book, I became addicted to reading every storyline, and I think I have to settle with saying that I love reading every new perspective equally. Each character’s internal struggles, different motivations, and their characterizations were extremely well-written; seeing how their paths connect with one another was truly delightful.""She had long ago learned that at least half of everything is presentation. Seem a victim, soon become one. Seem in charge, people fall over themselves to obey.""Superbly written and incredibly vivid battle scenes are one of Abercrombie’s strongest strength as an author, andA Little Hatreddoesn’t disappoint. The two big action sequences inA Little Hatredwere simply jaw-dropping. Abercrombie used the same storytelling style he implemented previously in one or two chapters inLast Argument of KingsandThe Heroesto create a chain of events with a seamless perspective’s transition that portrayed mayhem, destruction, and madness towards every participant in a conflict. The poor tend to pay the biggest price of war, and this was showed magnificently. Say one thing for Abercrombie, say he writes some of the best duel scenes in fantasy. The monstrous rage, the noise of clashing steels, the crushing impacts, and the bloody deathblows delivered; everything about the pulse-pounding duel featured inA Little Hatredreached a super palpable quality that made my reading experience totally engaging and immersive.“Why folk insisted on singing about great warriors all the time, Rikke couldn’t have said. Why not sing about really good fishermen, or bakers, or roofers, or some other folk who actually left the world a better place, rather than heaping up corpses and setting fire to things? Was that behavior to encourage?”I can vouch with temerity that Abercrombie has crafted another amazing book; expect great things from him and he shall deliver. Fans of grimdark fantasy andThe First Lawtrilogy will have an utterly terrific time reading this must-read book, I’m sure of it. Abercrombie has created a ground-breaking impact withThe First Lawtrilogy; a lot of modern grimdark fantasy series have been inspired by it. Based on the experience from the reading the first book of this trilogy alone, I don’t think it’s a stretch to claim thatThe Age of Madnesswill strengthen that notion. Fueled by furious action sequences, profound passages, compelling narratives, and characters that get under your skin;A Little Hatredis a bloody brilliant and breathtaking book. This absolutely stunning return to Abercrombie’s belovedFirst Law Worldonce again established himself as the reigning lord of grimdark fantasy. A new age for grimdark is here, and it is calledThe Age of Madness.

Jade War,"Many of you may know that Jade City is my favourite book of all time. And not just ‘one of my favourite books’ – Jade City is the favourite book. And now I find myself in the strange and unexpected position of finding a new favourite book of all time. I have loved Jade City so passionately for years that I never gave thought to the possibility that it would be dethroned so soon. It’s not often you read a book where the second book, the middle book of a trilogy no less, is undoubtedly better than the first book, and yet, Fonda Lee did it. Jade War, the sequel to Jade City, has dethroned its predecessor as my favourite book of all time. Jade War is more brutal, more devastating, more emotional, and more than you could ever expect it to be.So when Fonda Lee ran a contest on Twitter, tasking readers to come up with a Jade City-inspired art to win an ARC of Jade War, never in my life had I felt so grateful and excited to have some artistic ability. And when I won the giveaway with my fanart of Shae and received it in the mail (sobbing whilst opening it, obviously), I had no idea that, in my hands, I would be my new favourite book of all time.Here is my 100% spoiler-free review of Jade War (and has no spoilers for Jade City as well)!A STORY OF THE COST AND CONSEQUENCES OF WARFollowing the events of Jade City, the sequel follows the Kaul family of the No Peak Clan, one of two of Kekon’s most powerful clans in which jade-wearing warriors, Green Bones, pledge their loyalty and lives. With war brewing outside of their borders, the Kaul family find themselves balancing on a blade’s edge and faced with threats on all sides – the Mountain clan, foreign governments, criminal crime organisations, and jade smugglers. This is a sequel that takes the foundations built by its first book, and takes the story, its characters, and the stakes to new and terrifying heights. And hell, I’m still a little emotionally numb after reading it. (It was that good.)At the heart of Jade War, the story is heavily centered on war, and the implications the conflicts have on the Kaul family. True to its promises, Jade War does have some incredible action and fighting scenes that will leave you sweating with anxiety and adrenaline (Chapter 31, friends! Chapter 31!). However, Jade War is more than just fighting with blades and jade-powered abilities; Jade War is about the machinations of wars played behind closed doors: manipulation, politics, leverage, bribery, allying with enemies, character assassinations (and actual assassinations), and proxy wars mobilised by rich and major powers. Though the perspectives come largely from the Kaul family, Jade War also explores the impact such proxy wars will have on the people, particularly refugees, people in countries rife with corruption, and the lower class people who will do what they can to make it.But if you’re not too interested in the political and economic machinations of war, don’t worry: Jade War still delivers a powerful and impressive story about the members of the Kaul family. At the heart of the story, the characters and their stories coalesce into a haunting narrative about the personal and familial costs of one’s decisions and their irrevocable consequences. I liked the characters in Jade City, but Jade War made me love them – the characters’ stories are incredible, well-paced, and true to their developments. The pay-offs too? Unforgettable and will make you even more excited for the third instalment of Jade City.CHARACTERS BECOME GREENER - AND GRAYERAlthough there are many reasons to love Jade City, I think a reason why this book is so bloody brilliant is because of its characters. Fonda Lee is such an impeccable writer; everything she writes is so tight; there is no room for loose ends and development that meanders, and it shows. Indeed, her characters are no exception; the characters in Jade City, in particular the Kaul family, are some of the most realised and thoughtfully developed characters I have ever had the pleasure to read. Jade City established ripe ground for brilliant character development, and Lee did not squander any opportunities to develop the characters in Jade War.When I say that the characters become ‘greener’, I borrow the expression used by the characters in the book. Someone who is ‘green’ is someone who holds steadfast to their moral code as a jade warrior, a Green Bone; it is someone who adheres to their values as a Green Bone and their way of life and being. Indeed, the events of Jade War will test all the characters that you will love; it will push them to the edge, it will reveal how far they will go for their clan and their family. In particular, the story of Jade War will reveal the mortality of loyalty and honour, how tightly they will hold onto what they love and their way of life, and what they are willing to risk and sacrifice.In the same vein, Jade War will delve further into the characters, their identities, and their motivations, as they grapple with new roles and responsibilities in the clan that will force them to make impossible decisions. Across the book, you will witness the characters change, growing into the people that they have no choice but to become, and doing things that they may regret for the rest of their lives – but all, in the end, for good for the clan and their family. If it wasn’t clear in the first book, it will be evident in this: the characters in Jade War are all morally-gray. But here is what makes Jade War a brilliant book (and exemplifies why this series is fantastic): even if you disagree with the characters and their thoughts and their motivations and their choices, you will understand why they do it. Which, of course, makes it a more nail-biting read.I don’t want to talk too much about this because I think it is best left discovered as you read, but I unexpectedly found a few favourite new characters – some of which are old and you would have met in Jade City, but some of which are new. Though Shae still has a significant role in Jade War, you will see more of Wen as well – a character I was intrigued by in Jade City – and how her identity as a stone-eye (someone who doesn’t react to jade and thus can’t wield it; an identity which holds a lot of taboo) will structure the trajectory of her story, her choices, and her life. Be excited for the characters and their development in Jade War; it is fantastic.THE WORLD GETS BIGGER IN JADE WARFriends asked me how I found this book whilst reading it, and the best word I could use to describe it was… ‘bigger’ – and I don’t mean that in the physical-page-number sense. Whilst Jade City explored and developed the city and streets and communities of the city of Janloon, Jade War will venture beyond the small island’s confines and will follow the characters on their journeys beyond its borders. Readers will visit Uwiwa Islands, spend a great deal of time in Espenia, and will become intimately familiar with the conflicts between the other nations. But not only do we become familiar with its geography and their roles and affect on Kekon, readers will also get an idea of how their cultures and values differ.Naturally, as the world of Jade War gets bigger, readers will really begin to see how small the island of Kekon is in the context of the world stage and international relations. Moreover, Jade War strongly introduces something that was alluded to Jade City but was never really palpable: the perspectives of people outside of the city of Janloon, or the people who live outside of the Green Bone way. As the characters clash with foreign governments and thus different perspectives of how the world works, Lee powerfully and profoundly reveals how insular Kekon and the clans are through the outsiders' prejudiced yet astute perspectives of Green Bones and their ethnocentric isolationist values. I thought this was brilliant, and I loved how these cultural clashes call into question the morality of the characters in the story, particularly the Kauls.Furthermore, such differing perspectives will provoke readers to think about and confront the judgments made by the Kauls and those that oppose them - and the tectonic shift in how I perceived the Kauls was so riveting. I love the Kauls dearly, but I too later realised that I had romanticised the Green Bone way and was piqued (and later, impressed) that I had become so drawn into the Kauls' journey and had fervently justified their decisions only to realise -- wait, hang on. Quite frankly, this happens so subtly in the book (around Chapter 21?) and is one of the most affecting and powerful writing I have read in a long time.However, what I found particularly interesting (and pleasantly surprising) is that a significant subplot is dedicated to exploring a character’s immigrant experience, and is thus confronted with individuals of diaspora in another country. I actually loved this subplot immensely. I enjoyed the explorations of how people of diaspora find and maintain pieces of their heritage as a process of cultural preservation of their identities and forming communities, whilst also adopting behaviours and ways of life typical in their new home which may be alienating and othering from the perspective of someone who has never had to straddle two cultures. In other words, it was so interesting (and validating) to see the implications of a hyphenated diasporic identity within this fantasy world, and the portrayals of Kekonese-Espenian identity and experiences were authentic and multi-faceted.All of us are familiar with books with ‘second-book syndrome’; where the second book feels like filler between the epic beginning and epic ending. I am pleased, however, to tell you all that Jade War does more than just live up to its sequel: Jade War takes everything that is good in Jade City and makes it excellent.I’m calling it now: Jade War is the sequel of the year, and has set a high bar of how sequels should be done. Extraordinary in every way, Jade War is a shining example the incredible power of Asian fantasy and why Lee will forever be among my favourite authors. Lee should be proud of her hard work and of Jade War; it is an accomplishment and a masterpiece.Find my full review on my blog as well.-3rd July:Have you ever finished a book, and then slowly realised...

The old alliance between No Peak and The Mountain, necessary to outmatch the colonizers during the war, is slowly crippling, and the tension keeps growing, keeping you glued to your book, frantically turning the pages until you realize thateverything is fair game and that you'd best keep your heart in check.Too often Fantasy novels constructed with multiple POV force you to admit early on that some POVs capture your interest much more than others. I swear, I didn't feel anything approaching during most ofJade Citybut rather, I kept thinking NO NO THIS ONE IS MY FAVE every time the POV changed. Every. Damn. Time. Ididgrow more attached to one character in particular - and my friends won't be surprised in the slightest - but it does not mean that I resented the parts spent through the eyes of other characters.NEVER.And that can be explained quite easily when we know thatall the characters are fleshed-out, three dimensional and utterly fascinated me.Lan, Hilo, Shae, Anden, to name the main ones. They all have this little somethingspecialthat made me truly invested in their life. None of them are Manichean and we can't always condone their actions.They're wonderfullygreyand I loved them deeply all the more.Moreover,the family dynamicsare COMPLEX and so HEARTFELT and GENUINE and YES, I need to yell about it because that's SO RARE?●Lan,the Pillar, is a kind and measured leader but struggles to live up to his granddad tremendous expectations : can he harmonize the heartbreaking duality inherent to his role as Pillar of No Peak, when his family needs him to be both reasonable and ferocious?●Hilo,the Horn, leads his Finger and Fists into the brutality of the gang wars with charisma and cunning. On edge, unpredictable, so ruthless and yet so fiercely protective of his family and loved ones (yes, he's my fave. Don't judge me. He's so flawed so of course I adore him) (also I love his humor, I don't know what that says about me?)●Shae,the returning daughter who wants no part of the clan life but still cares deeply about her overbearing family, is searching for her identity, torn between her family and her hunger for peace and personal achievement.●Anden,the adopted son, biracial and gay, who tries not to be ruled by his doubts but lives with the constant fear of following the path of his dead mother's life - I want to protect him at all costs.... and so many more.I particularly appreciated that Janloon wasn't devoid of women.You know, what happens so often in fantasy novels? Plus the main female leads - Shae and in a minor way, Wen -don't ""owe"" their development and growth to an attempted rape- overused trope that, again, I can't stand anymore - and achieve what they want through different ways, which I loved. Sure, Kekon is stilla patriarchal and misogynistic societyat its core, and it's still way too hard for men to give away an ounce of their powers, more often than not. Yet they're here, they matter, they're notfaire-valoir.Thank you for that.Finally -I always appreciate getting to know the opponents in a novel, because failing that, they often lack the layers needed to make them believable and real characters.Admittedly, few chapters were narrated in their point of view inJade City, but as far as I'm concerned it was enough to understand their motivations and hence make the plot more complex.First of all, I wanted to share this excerpt from an interviewFonda Leegave toLightspeed Magazine, becauseit perfectly captured everything that madeJade Cityso refreshing andunique:As a second generation Asian American, that means finding inspiration from both Western and Eastern stories. I grew up surrounded and engrossed by Western fiction—Star Trek, Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, and so on—stories where there were rarely, if ever, any characters that looked like me and my family members. Only in early adulthood did I start really seeking out fiction from Asian sources—kung fu films, Hong Kong crime dramas, wuxia comic books. I found a lot to love, and that cross-cultural pollination in my brain is a wonderful source of ideas for me. In that sense, I think Jade City is a very Asian-American work.She added later that she wanted to createa heady blend of gangster epic, family saga, and martial arts fantasy, and to that I say :BRAVO. It was fantastic from start to finish.I wouldn't want to spoil your read, and trust me on this, less you know about the plot, more you'll enjoyJade City: albeit its instant attractiveness, this novel takes cares of reminding the reader that its world is nasty.People lie, corrupt, kill.If they love so strongly, one should not forget that love isn't always enough.Political schemes, violent street war, internal struggles, twists and turns - I was captivated.The sudden changes of rhythm brought an uncertainty, a sentiment ofanguishvery interesting to the plot, and thus made the reading experience even better. Truly, I lovedeverything:the slow cunning phases, the fast, nasty fights, the emotional hardships...My heart started beating erratically more than once. I was so invested in the Kaul's family story, I couldn't breathe. One should remember when diving in :this gem of a book is harsh, sometimes brutal, and doesn't shy away from violence. I adored it, but I strongly advise you to look at the content warnings listed below.That's not all, though : a world-building so rich wouldn't be content without the rise of broader issues, such as colonization and war. There's so much potential to look for in the sequel.Finally, the writing is compelling, imaginative - see, for example, the names of the different status in the clan, inspired by esoteric titles used by the Chinese Triads but original all the same - and I really enjoyed the dialogues (especially Hilo's, whose witty remarks made my day).► The sequel can't come out soon enough.All-time favorite and highly recommended.CW - graphic violence, death, cruelty to animals, addiction, drug, mention of sexual child abuse, gore, sex scenes, ableist words unchallenged, racial slurThe author's introduction : [youtubehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnMFW...]For more of my reviews, please visit:",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43587154-jade-city,Jade City.txt
Shaman's Crossing,"I really haven't read enough Robin Hobb. She has flown under my radar, mostly because my first encounters with her were through the library, and I have this bad habit of checking out books in the middle of the series (ahem,Golden Fool) and then wondering what the hell is going on. Last year I readAssassin's Apprentice, and I have acquired the remaining two books in that trilogy, so I hope to finish that soon. For now, however, I've turned to the Soldier Son trilogy. And though I've exceeded the amount of space I usually devote to anecdotes, I shall mention how I acquired these books. I actually readShaman's Crossingyears ago, probably back when it first released. I didn't like it. I thought it wasdull. So I was hesitant to re-read it and finish the series, but all three were left abandoned at a one-off bookswap we had at the gallery where I work. I don't like to turn down free books, much less a complete trilogy in matching paperback.So here we are.WithShaman's Crossing, Robin Hobb turns her attention to colonialism. She combines world-building with fairly competent characterization, politics with just a pinch of zesty magic, to create a story that is rich if a little over-saturated. Although I have reservations about this book, I think Hobb does deserve the accolade theBaltimore Sunhas blurbed on the cover of my edition: sheis""a master fantasist.""I don't think I can talk about the world without talking about Nevare, and I certainly can't talk about him without talking about his world. So I'll do both. Nevare Burvelle is the soldier son of a new noble; i.e., his father was also a soldier, but he so distinguished himself in battle that the king elevated him to a newly-created lordship. And in Gernia, commoner sons take on their father's profession, while noble sons follow an order: heir, soldier, priest, artist, scholar, etc. It's all in the Holy Scrolls, and apparently violating that order is taboo. This is one of those premises that sounds really cool but that I have a hard time believing would actually work. But I rolled with it. Oh, and women don't get to do anything except plot political marriages and have babies and wear dresses (I think in that order).If you are starting to get the idea that Gernia, for all its power and prestige and riches and quality of life, is a not-so-nice allegory for the British Empire, you might be on the right track. And Gernia's imperialist policies form the political backdrop for Nevare's maturation into an adult and his conflict with the spiritual forces of the Plainspeople and the even more mysterious, distant Specks. Nevare becomes caught in the middle of a three-way conflict: the Plainspeople are fighting against the Specks, who drove the Plainspeople onto the plains in the first place. From the west, Gernia is displacing the Plainspeople, and will soon go up against the Specks. Nevare, thanks to an encounter with a Plainsman, has been magically linked to a Speck spell that has its own ideas about how he can be used, as a tool, to bring about Gernia's ruination.So here's the thing: I like Nevare. He is earnest but not obnoxious, and he is capable and competent yet still prone to making mistakes. (I can't stand protagonists who always manage to get it right.) So, because Gernia is Nevare's homeland, and yes, if I'm being honest, because I've internalized eurocentrism despite my best efforts, I kind of want Nevare and his country to succeed. Well, not so muchsucceedas in colonize and oppress the Plainspeople and the Specks; but I don't want Nevare to have to betray his own people. At the same time, I want the Specks and the Plainspeople and their magicks to survive against Gernia, against its soldiers and technology and cold iron.These paradoxical, torn loyalties experienced by the reader through Nevare are what makeShaman's Crossingfascinating and brilliant. I want Nevare to survive and make his father proud; I want the Plainspeople and Specks to survive. While not mutually exclusive, one of these will definitely need to compromise in degree somehow. I'm interested to see how Hobb resolves the plot, but for now let me ruminate upon what it means.There are no easy answers. Although it can be trying to hear the justifications and racism at times, seeing colonialism from this perspective does help me get into the mind of the colonialists and understand the motives driving them to expand. It isn't just avarice; Gernia itself feels threatened by rival country Landsing, which wrested from them their coastal provinces, rendering their proud navy obsolete. Unready to provoke another war with Landsing, Gernia's king turns his eye eastward. So there is a pressure-cooker situation happening, where Gernia can't stop moving east, and the Plainspeople have been pushed westward by the Specks. Something's gotta give.This is worldbuilding, people. Living, dynamic worlds where events of the novel are but a small part of what's happening. So many fantasy novels build great political intrigues into their plots, yet these exist in a vacuum where it seems every other political entity happens to be sleeping. Hobb has created a society shaped by advances in technology, the loss of a costly war, and controversial political decisions by its ruler. This, in turn, has shaped Nevare. He is growing up as the first of a new generation, the soldier sons of new nobles, attending the King's Cavalla Academy.Of course, peeling away the politics, we see that the structure of this novel is that ofthe boarding school. The King's Cavalla Academy is like a Hogwarts setting (without the magic). I'm assuming the friendships and enmities Nevare has formed here will contributed to the plot of the subsequent two books. Most of his time spent at the Academy consists of being persecuted for being a new noble.Oh, in case you didn't guess, the old nobles who were around before the war didn't appreciate the king diluting their power with new nobles who are, naturally, loyal to him. When it comes to communicating this concept, Hobb gets very heavy-handed. Sometimes it seems like every second conversation Nevare has is about how the old nobles hate the new nobles and are waging a proxy class war via their sons. It's relevant; it's realistic, but it's alsoway overstated.This tendency to harp on the intricacies of her world is Hobb's one indulgence that detracts from an otherwise-great book. It doesn't help that, sinceShaman's Crossingis in the first person, we hear it all in Nevare's voice. I love that Hobb is enthusiastic about her world—and that her world is worth being enthusiastic about—but sometimes I just put the book aside and took a break because the lengthy descriptions and exposition were getting on my nerves.You know who also got on my nerves? Epiny. I feel bad, because she's a spunky little women's rights activist who is surprisingly good at critical thinking. Yet she's also young, and she acts so immaturely at times. I so wanted someone, anyone, to tell her to start behaving with a modicum of composure. However, this is not aflaw; it is probably deliberate in, or at least very appropriate to, how Hobb tells the story.Shaman's Crossingtakes a lot of common fantasy motifs—technology versus magic, soldiers versus tribal warriors, class conflict, etc.—but as with her other series, Hobb has fabricated both story and setting enough to make her work stand out. Even though this isn't one of my favourite fantasy novels, and it isn't my favourite Robin Hobb story, it still demonstrates her ability as a fantasy writer, and it's entertaining and even a little thought-provoking. As the beginning of a trilogy, it has a satisfying conclusion and a tantalizing arc. As its own story, it is a deep character piece set against the backdrop of colonial politics.Shaman's Crossingis more complex than I gave it credit for being the first time I read it: don't make the mistake I did.My Reviews of the Soldier Son trilogy:Forest Mage→",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45110.Shaman_s_Crossing,Shaman's Crossing.txt
The Poppy War,"”Children ceased to be children when you put a sword in their hands. When you taught them to fight a war, then you armed them and put them on the front lines, they were not children anymore. They were soldiers.”This book. I mean…THIS BOOK! *sighs deeply and shakes head*There is so much to be said about “The Poppy War” and I’m afraid I won’t even be able to put at least half of my thoughts into decent sentences. Because after finishing this book about a month ago(A MONTH AGO!!!)I still have troubles to sort out all of my feelings and thoughts.“The Poppy War”is a great book but it tackles a lot of serious topics and I guess that’s the reason why my heart always feels kind of heavy when I think about it. Of course there is a war raging in this book but there happen so many other things that it’s almost impossible not to flinch when you reach those final 40%. Think about every atrocity that’s ever happened and you get a good idea about what you’re going to read in this book. There’s genocide, rape, torture, self-harm… and that’s just me naming a few of the triggers that might come your way.”War doesn’t determine who’s right. War determines who remains.”Let me tell you this: The longer you continue the worse it gets and even though this was masterfully done and I loved the world building and all the characters, there is still this strange undercurrent of heavy sadness and dread. Golyn Niis was so tough to read, I still get goose bumps when I think about it. This chapter was so, so, so, so damn hard to get through and I can’t remember the last time I read a book and felt that way. Maybe I never felt that way reading a book before. At least I can’t remember a single book that actually made me feel like this. I swear my stomach turned and I had troubles to breathe. I was feeling nauseous reading a book! Yes, it was that heavy! Everyone who already read the book will know what I’m talking about and to those who didn’t: It’s really as bad as everyone claims it to be! I got plenty of warnings but nothing prepared me for Golyn Niis!”Amateurs obsess over strategy, Irjah had once told their class. Professionals obsess over logistics.”Still, despite this heavy feeling of uneasiness that always overcomes me when I think about “The Poppy War” this book was definitely worth reading! I loved the fantasy elements and the idea of powers from the gods! Plus I really enjoyed the chapters at Sinegard Academy and the chimei! What I loved the most was the representation of human nature though. I might be alone with this but it’s obvious that R.F. Kuang put a lot of effort into her characters and you could see it in the way they grow, develop and change. Their character arcs were so amazing to follow, I’m in awe! And before I continue to gush about them here, I might as well move to my character section instead. ;-PThe characters:This is my spoilery spoiler section and if you didn’t read the book already you better turn around and leave. If you’re still curious and don’t want to heed my warning you may proceed at your own risk! I mean I warned you, right? ;-PRin:”No – they couldn’t just do this to her. They might think they could sweep her away like rubbish, but she didn’t have to lie down and take it. She had come from nothing. She wasn’t going back to nothing.”Oh gods! Rin! I can’t believe what she did in the end and I can’t wrap my head around the fact that such a sweet and innocent girl could change that much! But it still happened and her descent was so heavy to watch. >_< I guess that’s what happens when you play with fire, quite literally in her case. She got addicted to the power and I’m so damn afraid of what she’s going to do next! I loved her defiance and strength at the beginning of the book, how she wanted to learn and did everything possible to achieve her goal. She was so determined and strong-willed! But then the war began and all those things happened and with every chapter Rin changed! She became something different, she hardened her heart, she lost her moral compass and made decisions that got her deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole! And then she did the unthinkable and I’m not sure if she’ll ever be able to return from that darkness again. T_T The ending broke my heart, for Rin, for the person she could have been for everything sheHADbeen before she came to Sinegard. She’s not the person she used to be and I find myself weeping for everything she lost and for what she became. =(((”She didn’t want to be possessed. She wanted to remain free.””Then I will die on my feet,” she said. “I will die with flames in my hand and fury in my heart.””My god didn’t make me do anything,” she said. “The gods can’t make our choices for us. They can only offer their power, and we can wield it. And I did, and this is what I chose.” She swallowed. “I don’t regret it.””She was sane, she was convinced of it. She was whole. She had lost much, yes, but she still had her own mind. She made her decisions. She chose to accept the Phoenix. She chose to let it invade her mind.”Altan:”We’re the final front,” said Altan. “If we fail, this country’s lost.” He clapped her on the shoulder. “Excited?”Altan broke my heart. At first I had the same impression like everyone else: That he knows what he’s doing, that he’s in control and a perfect student/soldier but the more we got to see from him, the more it became obvious that he’s far from all those things! This boy was broken beyond repair and he hid it so well that no one ever noticed until it was too late! I can’t say that I liked his actions but I could understand why he acted the way he did! He was lashing out at everyone because he was like a wild animal that only saw threats and didn’t know how to react to kindness. Altan was unable to see that not everyone who confronted him wanted to do him harm. Which makes me sad on so many levels. =( That poor, poor boy! To be tortured like this, to get out of it alive, to live with his past and the knowledge that it might happen again. Just to live with everything he went through! To draw breath every day and to continue, to keep on moving! I can’t even begin to comprehend how he must have felt and I can’t put into words how strongly I feel for him. T_T And I don’t want to believe that he’s dead! He can’t be dead! >_<”I don’t know,” he said after a long moment. “I don’t know what I’m doing.””Altan’s fire drew as its source an unending hate. It was a deep, slow burn. She could almost taste it, the venomous intent, the ancient misery, and it horrified her.How could one person hate so much?What had happened to him?Kitay:”One urinating statue for my easily entertained friend.”Rin blushed. “Kitay, I can’t.”“It costs nothing.”“It costs a lot to me,” she said.Kitay placed the statue in her hand. “If you say one more thing about money, I’m leaving you to get lost.”I absolutely adored Kitay! He’s such a good friend and I loved that Rin and he became besties. =) Despite being fortunate enough to be one of the rich kids at Sinegard Academy he still reached out to her and became her friend. I think that’s what I loved about him the most, he didn’t care about titles or money, he just cared about the person and what it could do! Kitay is the living and breathing proof that good people exist and in the end his character was the only one that gave me any hope. Because despite all the things he witnessed and regardless of everything that happened to him, he still had moral values and acted according to them. In a world so harsh and cruel that it changed everyone around him, he still held on to his convictions and I loved him for it! <333”There was a hard glint to his eyes that she had never seen in him before. He looked as if he had aged five years. He looked like his father. He was like a sword that had been sharpened, metal that had been tempered.”Jiang:”I am a mortal who has woken up, and there is power in awareness.”I really don’t know how to feel about Jiang! I actually liked him at the beginning of the book but I was so disappointed by him when it ended. His character was some sort of catalyst and I had the distinct feeling that he could have done more, that he SHOUD HAVE done more! What if he would have taught Rin about her powers? What if he would have allowed her to use them in a safe setting? What if he would have fought alongside them and would have helped her to control the phoenix? He basically left Altan and Rin to their own devices and this set them on the dark path they were descending at the end. How different everything could have gone if Jiang would have watched out for them! =( To drop Altan as his student was the first mistake he made and not to teach Rin properly apparently his last.”Ah. The law.” Jiang sniffed at an unidentified leaf and then tossed it away. “So inconvenient. So irrelevant.”The relationships & ships:Rin & Altan:”She knew what addiction looked like. Opium smokers were yellowed, useless sacks of flesh. They did not fight like Altan did. They did not move like Altan did. They were not perfect, lethal animals of graceful beauty.”Okay, I’m going to say it:I DIDN’T SHIP RIN AND ALTAN!I’m sorry but I just couldn’t! They didn’t have much of a relationship before Rin joined the Cike and once she was a part of them her relationship with Altan was nothing but abusive. He slapped her, hurt her with words, forced her to do things she didn’t want to do and was everything else but supportive. How was I supposed to ship that? I get that Altan was thoroughly broken but he didn’t have to let it out on Rin and as frustrated as he might have been with her, he still had no right to hurt her. So nope, it was clear right from the beginning that he didn’t respect her as much as she respected him and if you ask me those two never had a future. (Not saying that I wouldn’t love for Altan to come back again. I still wouldn’t ship him with Rin though) I’ll never ship those two and I stand by it. Fight me! *lol* ;-P”Hey. Hey.”Cool fingers wrapped around her wrists. Gently, Altan pulled her hands away from her face. She looked up and met his eyes. They were a shade of crimson brighter than poppy petals.“It’s okay,” he said. “I know. I know what it’s like. I’m going to help you.””She had adored an idea of him, an archetype, a version of him that was invulnerable. But now she knew the truth, she knew the realness of Altan and his vulnerabilities and most of all his pain… and still she loved him.”He leaned forward and grasped her face in both hands. She thought for a bizarre moment that he was going to kiss her. He didn’t. He pressed his forehead against hers for a long time. She closed her eyes. She drank in the sensation of her skin against his. She seared it into her memory.”Rin & Nezha:”We aren’t here to be sophisticated. We’re here to fuck people up.”Now that’s a relationship I could appreciate! Yes, Nezha was an ass at the beginning of the book but in contrast to Altan he actually realized his faults and apologized to Rin. I loved how they both grew out of their initial animosity and became friends in the end. And those fighting scenes!! They were pure harmony on the battlefield and anyone who claims differently didn’t read the book! XD Just like Kitay seemed to have become a moral compass for Rin the same could be said for Nezha and I’m sure if he’d been around at the end she wouldn’t have gone down that dark road. >_< Unfortunately Nezha was lost in the toxic mist and seems to be dead. I refuse to believe that he’s gone for good though. I mean he had some serious healing abilities so maybe he survived it and became a prisoner? But then again he most likely would have been with the Mugenese when Rin launched her attack and I don’t know if he would have been able to survive this as well. >_< I really hope Nezha will magically reappear in the second book! =)”But I saved your life. Doesn’t that make us at least a little square?”Square? Square? She had to laugh. “You almost got me expelled!”“And you almost killed me,” he said. That shut her up.“I was scared of you,” Nezha continued. “And I lashed out. I was stupid. I was a spoiled brat. I was a real pain in the ass. I thought I was better than you, and I’m not. I’m sorry.”Altan & Chaghan:”They had come to an understanding, she and Chaghan. They were no longer opposed, vying for Altan’s favor. They were allies, now, bound by the mutual atrocities they had commited.”I’m going to be honest here: I’m such a sucker for Chaghan!!! I love his character!!!! And is it just me or did I actually feel some gay vibes between those two?! Altan and Chaghan definitely had more chemistry than Rin and Altan ever had! *lol* And they didn’t even have all too many scenes together! I got the distinct feeling that something happened when they spent those three days in the valleys and I’m not talking about Altan winning a fight between them, feel me? *wriggles eyebrows* Haha! ;-P Gosh, I really would have loved to find out more about their relationship and this is just one more reason why Altan can’t be dead! I just ship him and Chaghan too much to accept his death! Period! XDConclusion:“The Poppy War”was an amazing and sometimes truly revolting dark tale about a young girl that follows her own path and fights for what she thinks is right. It shows us how people can grow and how their circumstances and perceptions can change them. For better or for worse… This tale isn’t over yet. In fact it just began and I can’t wait to read what’s going to happen next. Let’s continue to hope for the best while we expect the worst, because apparently that’s the only attitude that will get you through this series. ;-)”And she would call the gods to do such terrible things.”",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35068705-the-poppy-war,The Poppy War.txt

Shadow and Bone,"”I’ve been waiting for you a long time, Alina,” he said. “You and I are going to change the world.”Leigh’s cooking receipt for“Shadow and Bone”:1 naïve and rather plain looking heroine1 handsome childhood friend1 dark, mysterious and irresistible villain1 close friend that’s kind of an outsider as wellA pinch of magicA hint of insecurityA handful of unexpected eventsAnd half a teaspoon of scheming and betrayalTo get the full effect you have to mix up all the ingredients and let the dough rise for at least half an hour. Well and then you just mix it all again! *lol*Et voila! Now you have a book with all the typical young adult tropes that somehow managed to take a different kind of turn than you initially expected. ;-PI swear some of the things Leigh wrote were even a surprise for such a long-established Young Adult fan like myself. Haha! She’s a clever woman, I have to give her that! XDThe characters:The Darkling is known for his swoon-worthy Darkness, I’m known for my spoilery characters section! Guess we all have our talents. ;-P Anyway, if you don’t want to read any spoilers you better click that nice exit button now. ;-P Otherwise you’ll enter the Fold and no matter if you’ve read the book or not, it’s usually a place of no return. XDAlina:”I guess you only look like a mouse,” he whispered in my ear, and then beckoned to one of his personal guard.”I liked Alina, but she didn’t sweep me off my feet. I mean she’s basically your typical Young Adult heroine: orphan, plain looking, stubborn, kind, powerful and very, very naïve. *lol* So yeah, she was as likable as they come, but I didn’t really have hearty-eyes when I read about her. I’m pretty sure she’s going to be on guard after the events of book one and I can’t help but wonder what’s going to happen in the next book. There are definitely a lot of possibilities and I’m looking forward to read about her character development. Because , yes, there will be a lot of character development ahead of her and I hope it’s going to make her interesting. I mean, no YA heroine ever started out with a fully developed character so I guess we’ll have to see what Leigh has in store for us! ;-)The Darkling:”He had a sharp, beautiful face, a shock of thick black hair, and clear gray eyes that glimmered like quartz.”I finally met the infamous Darkling!!!YESH!!! *runs around hyper*And he’s as amazing as I thought he’d be!!! I love this dark, mysterious, broody, intriguing and sexy guy! XD And I sooo wasn’t surprised that he’s the villain. I mean come on, Alina!!! He’s named“The Darkling”for a reason!!! I can’t believe she was so naïve. *lol* Well anyway, where were we? Yes, the Darkling! XD I love him to bits and pieces. He’s everything I need a villain to be: cruel, cunning, calculating, ambitious, ruthless and misguided. XD Not to mention so swoon-worthy that I had a hard time to concentrate whenever I read one of his scenes. *lol* So yeah, I’m a fan of the Darkling now and I’m not ashamed!!! <333 Can’t wait to find out what he’s going to do in the next two books! =))”I’m not used to people trying to kill me.”“Really? I hardly notice anymore.””I hope you don’t expect fairness from me, Alina. It isn’t one of my specialities.””He sounded so sincere, so reasonable, less a creature of relentless ambition than a man who believed he was doing the right thing for his people. Despite all he’d done and all he intended, I did almost believe him. Almost.”Mal:”I’ve risked my life for you. I’ve walked half the length of Ravka for you, and I’d do it again and again and again just to be with you, just to starve with you and freeze with you and hear you complain about hard cheese every day. So don’t tell me we don’t belong together,” he said fiercely. He was very close now, and my heart was suddenly hammering in my chest. “I’m sorry it took me so long to see you, Alina. But I see you now.”I don’t get why so many people hate Mal. I mean he’s actually kinda cute! I didn’t like Kilorn in “Red Queen” and I usually tend to dislike the “handsome childhood friends” in YA books but I really ended up liking Mal. He’s nice and caring and he’s a loyal friend of Alina. Plus he’s not as annoying as they usually are! Mal was a nice counterweight to Alina, he always thought ahead was reasonable, knew his limits and seemed to be a rather laid-back guy. So why all the hate?! Is he doing something bad in the next two books?! I don’t understand all the annoyed updates I read about him, because I think he’s a decent love interest and I really like him. XDGenya:”You should be used to being gawked at by now.”“And yet I’m not.”“Well, if it gets too bad, give me a signal, and I’ll get up on the banquet table, toss my skirt over my head, and do a little dance. That way no one will be looking at you.”Aww I loved Genya so damn much!! <333 She’s such an amazing woman and I really hope that she’ll end up on Alina’s side in the next book. I know why she had to support the Darkling and why she didn’t dare to act against his wishes and I feel really sorry for her. I wish there would have been more scenes with my precious girl but since she was only a side character in the first book her appearances were rather limited. Still, she swept me off my feet and I hope to see her again! There’s still so much I don’t know about her and I really want to meet her again! Hopefully under better circumstances this second time around. =)Nikolai:”What about the other one?” I asked I knew the King and Queen had a younger son, but I’d never actually seen him.“Sobachka?”“You can’t call a royal prince ‘puppy,’ “ I laughed.Soo, can anyone explain why Nikolai is called “Sobachka”? *lol* I thought I’d get to know him in this book but all I got were a few little hints that only made me even more curious. Guess he’s going to make his entrance in the next book?! I’m soo damn curious you have no idea!!! XDBaghra:”It isn’t an animal that shies away from you or chooses whether or not to come when you call it. Do you ask your heart to beat or your lungs to breathe? Your power serves you because that is its purpose, because it cannot help but serve you.”Ohh Baghra certainly was an interesting character. For one thing she wasn’t just Alina’s cruel and relentless instructor but also the Darkling’s mother! Yes, you read right! His freaking mother!!! *LOL* Leigh, you did something amazing there!!! I mean how many YA and fantasy books did I read?! Too many to count, but the villain never ever had a mom! XD Well, in this trilogy he has one and she’s not happy with her son! Haha! I just loved this!!! Thank you Leigh, this was truly amazing! <333The Ships:Alina & The Darkling:”The problem with wanting,” he whispered, his mouth trailing along my jaw until it hovered over my lips, “is that it makes us weak.”They had some sizzling chemistry that’s for sure!! I loved it when the Darkling did his best to seduce Alina and in all honesty I definitely wouldn’t have been as restrained as her. *lol* I really don’t know how she even managed to contain herself. I got weak knees just reading about him and I admire Alina for not throwing herself at him. Haha! I doubt I’d have had that strength. I guess their ship sunk and ended up being shipwrecked in the end though. Pity, I certainly would have loved to read more of those intense and hot scenes. ;-P”So you do make mistakes,” I said without thinking.He paused in the act of pulling on his gloves, and I pressed my lips together nervously. “I didn’t mean –““Of course I make mistakes,” he said. His mouth curved into a half smile. “Just not often.”Alina & Mal:”Look at me.” I willed myself to raise my eyes to his. “I know you’re scared. I am, too. But we’re going to do this, and we’re going to be fine. We always are. Okay?”I loved their strong friendship and I lived for their easy banter. They knew each other inside out and it was refreshing to see that the “handsome childhood bestie” trope worked out nicely for once. In all the other YA books the childhood friend always ends up being scorned, not in this one! Leigh actually managed to pull it off to give them a good and solid basis for a strong relationship. =) Which is a first! I never read a YA book in which the best friend actually ended up being the main love interest. So, Queen Leigh, you have all my respect!! *bows* I’m not sure if it will stay that way and if they’ll still be together at the end of the last book, but I have hope for them and this is more than I had for other YA bestie couples. XDHe swallowed, and I could see him struggle with the knowledge, but all he said was, “All right.”I let out a sound that was half laugh, half sob. “Only you could contemplate imminent death and just say ‘all right.’ “He smiled at me and pushed the hair back from my tear-stained face. “How about ‘oh no’?”Conclusion:I really enjoyed“Shadow and Bone”and I was so curious how it would continue that I already started with the second book. I usually don’t start with the next book until I wrote a proper review for the first one so that should tell you enough about how desperately I wanted to read on. *lol*So yeah, if you’re a sucker for YA tropes and want to see how they can be written in unexpected ways, I highly recommend you to read this book! You won’t be disappointed! Queen Leigh knows her stuff! ;-P",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37834723-shadow-and-bone,Shadow and Bone.txt
Age of Myth,"It’s always a great feeling when you start a new series from an author whose work you loved and find out their storytelling skill in their first installment of a series has improved. Well done, Michael J. Sullivan.On my first read ofAge of Myth, I gave it a 3.5/5 stars rating. Five years later, today, I finished my reread of the book. Similar to my experience of rereadingThe Riyria Revelations, I lovedAge of Mythmore on my second read. Let me enlighten you a bit on why this reread worked so well. And to do this, I will have to compare my experience of readingAge of MythandThe Crown Conspiracy, the first book inThe Riyria Revelationsseries, and also my reread experience of them both.“If given a choice between a potentially great hardship and doing nothing, people gravitated toward what was most familiar and comfortable. That was why leadership was needed. To do what was necessary rather than what was easy.”The first time I readAge of Myth, I remember feeling somewhat disappointed again by it. Do not get me wrong,Age of Mythwas a good book, and it still is. I had a few issues with it, but overall, I enjoyed my reading experience. I cannot emphasize this enough, but when it comes to reading books by Michael J. Sullivan, knowing what you're getting into matters a lot in influencing my enjoyment. Even on my first read ofAge of Myth, I loved it more thanThe Crown Conspiracyalready. And one of the main reasons why this occurred was because I started the book with the right expectations compared to when I first started readingThe Riyria Revelations.I have talked about this plenty of times already. But back when I first startedTheft of Swords, everyone I knew told me something along the line of: ""The Riyria Revelationsis the most epic fantasy series with the best bromance ever!"" And I, at least on my first read, disagree with these notions. First, do not readThe Riyria Revelationsexpecting it will be an epic fantasy story with a grand scope likeA Song of Ice and FireorThe Stormlight Archive. I prefer callingThe Riyria Revelationsa high fantasy series rather than epic fantasy. I know they are interchangeable, but I feel like putting the word epic implies a series will have massively intricate world-building and war scenes.Second, although I agree that Royce and Hadrian have one of the best friendships in fantasy, especially after my second read, I initially had a lot of difficulties caring toward Royce as a character. I wish someone had told me I would understand and agree with the high praises only after I reached at least the second omnibus of the series. Long story short, I startedThe Riyria Revelationswith very high and wrong expectations. I was incredibly disappointed withThe Crown Conspiracyon my first read. I gave it 2/5 stars on my first read, but thankfully, it received an upgrade on my second read to 4/5 stars by starting it with the right expectations. However, enough about that, I’m not here to talk aboutThe Riyria Revelations. All you have to know is this. I dislikedTheft of Swordson my first read, loved it on my second read, and on both reading occasions of reading the series, I lovedHeir of Novronto death.“Fulfillment comes from striving to succeed, to survive by your own wits and strength. Such things make each of us who we are... You lose that in captivity, lose yourself, and that loss saps your capacity for joy. I think comfort can be a curse, an addiction that without warning or notice erodes hope. You know what I mean?... Live with it long enough and the prison stops being the walls or the guards. Instead, it’s the fear you can’t survive on your own, the belief you aren’t as capable, or as worthy, as others. I think everyone has the capacity to do great things, to rise above their everyday lives; they just need a little push now and then.”If you are new to Sullivan’s work, try to ignore some of the high praises, from myself included, towards Sullivan's books in your expectations of reading the first book of any of his series. From readingThe Riyria Revelations, you will understand why we love his books so much when you get to the end of the series. My reading and reread experience towardAge of Mythmainly improved because of that, and now I am making my way through this series, too, hoping I will reach that satisfying conclusion inAge of Empyre. Alright, onward to my review ofAge of Myth. Yes, I am indeed just getting started.Picture:Age of MythCover Art by Marc SimonettiIsn't that cover by Marc Simonetti just freaking gorgeous?Age of Mythis the first book out of six inThe Legends of the First Empireby Michael J. Sullivan. If I were to judge from the first book only, this series has the potential to be even better thanThe Riyria Revelations, but that is a difficult ordeal to hurdle. For those of you who don't know, Sullivan’s publishing method is a bit different from most traditionally published authors. He wrote the entire series first before releasing it periodically. Doing this means we do not have to be scared of his series not being completed, even if Sullivan gets teleported to another dimension. For more details on this, just read the author’s note at the end of the book, or you may ask Sullivan himself; he will be happy to tell you why in detail. This method, however, comes with a disadvantage. It may result in the first book of his series as the weakest out of the entire series, similar toThe Riyria Revelations. The wonderful thing from this, though, is if this series follows the same sense of progression in quality, then the last book inThe Legends of the First Empirewill become the best book of the series.“Power has a way of seducing by saying what you want to hear. Remember, it’s easier to believe an outlandish lie confirming what you suspect than the most obvious truth that denies it.The plot inAge of Mythbegins with Raithe, a Rhune (human), killing a Fhrey (Elf). Worshipped as Gods during this era, the Fhrey being killed off by a human means a great deal. This event sparks the flame of rebellion.Age of Mythrevolves around introducing the characters of the novel, and how the human gathered their army for the upcoming war against the Fhrey. There weren’t many crucial events happening in the first book. The plot was predictable, and one of the main villains in this book is pretty much a bear. That said, it somehow worked out well for the novel. The tone of the narrative is relatively light-hearted, and the pacing and the prose flow really well. I finished reading the book within two days. The novel was addictive to read despite the lack of big events. And I honestly felt this is all possible due to the likable characters and accessible prose. The themes of bravery and leadership were also executed magnificently.“People who lead don’t need to remind others who the leader is.”Personally, I have not found myself fully interested in Raithe yet. Thankfully, Sullivan’s trademark of writing lovable female characters immediately returned. To this day, Sullivan’s capability in writing realistic and compelling female characters without forcibly making them mega strong with swords or martial arts remains one of the best in the fantasy genre. It is one of the things I will always praise him for.Age of Mythshowed clear improvements in Sullivan’s characterization.The Riyria Revelationson my first read required four books to make me care about the characters; this time, Sullivan did it in one. Malcolm, Persephone, Suri, and Minna (a white wolf) were my favorite characters in the novel. I don’t know whether this is a coincidence or not, but the resemblance between Suri and Minna with Princess Mononoke is almost uncanny, which is a plus to me because I love that anime.Picture:Princess Mononokefanart by muju on deviantArtThe Legends of the First Empire, taking place thousands of years before Royce and Hadrian's story, is a dissection of the legends and lores told inThe Riyria Revelations. If you have readThe Riyria ChronicleorThe Riyria Revelations, you will find a lot of Easter Eggs in the series here. This is why, although technically you can start your journey into the world of Elan fromAge of Myth, I still think it would be better if you have readThe Riyria Revelationsfirst. There is nothing new in the world-building here. It’s a typical classic fantasy with dwarfs, elves, and many other elements that have been done for decades. Sullivan, however, made up for this lack of originality with these intersecting lore, histories, Easter Eggs, and characters. And in my opinion, Sullivan's prose has increased significantly in quality. Even on my first read, I was never bored reading through the book. It felt easy to read, simple, vivid, and yet highly addictive.“Fools believe silence is a void needing to be filled; the wise understand there’s no such thing as silence.”As for the issues I had withAge of Myth, I feel like the conflict ended too conveniently several times. For example, the climax sequence was a chapter full of battles, but it ended in two paragraphs after a particular character decided to join. Adding to the fact that the conflict was won easily, I do not think this character received more than a scratch throughout the book. Lastly, I may be nit-picky here, but I found some of the namings so out of place. I mean, there were some modern contemporary names like Sarah and Jason. This would be okay if everyone was named the same way, but it’s not. It took my immersion away every time these modern names were mentioned in the novel. Can you imagine if Legolas was named Kevin? Or Aragorn was named Jim? Frodo named Daniel? Exactly.“That’s what a good wife does, keeps your dreams alive even when you don’t believe anymore.”Overall, I truly enjoyed readingAge of Myth. The issues I had with it were too small to affect my reading enjoyment. It is a well-written and easy-to-read novel suitable for those who love reading classic fantasy or for new readers of adult fantasy. And remember, considering that this is only the first book out of six, and this series is written by Michael J. Sullivan, I have high hopes that the last book of the series will be the best installment.“What length will a mother go to on behalf of her child? How long is time?

How to See Fairies,"“Partake of every simple pleasureFor living is the finest treasure.”-the Gnome King’s treasure songI purchased this beautiful collection of illustrations and stories from Folio Society because Charles van Sandwyk is one of, if not my favorite illustrator.The collection contains the following stories:How to see Fairies 1993Wee Folk 1994Pocket Guide to the Little People 1997The Gnome Kong’s Treasure Song 2000The Fairies Christmas 2001Afterglow 2008The Fairy Market 2009The Folio Society’s collection comes in a gorgeous red protective slipcase with more of van Sandwyk’s illustrations repeated in gold on the outside. The book itself was bound and printed in Italy with beautiful high quality Italian paper that does credit to van Sandwyk’s beautiful illustrations.This is a beautiful collection and is almost as special to me as one of his hand-bound stories straight from van Sandwyk’s own studio.The stories are sweet and magical, but not as magical as the illustrations...his portrayal of nature and all of its beautiful little details is second to none.

Malice,"Classic fantasy with a twist - can't wait to sink my teeth into the next book.Final Rating: 4.3/5🌕🌕🌕🌕🌗Malice is a fantasy saga that's both classic and yet refreshing. Sure, it's got the usual good vs. evil setup, and a whole heap of fantasy tropes (blacksmith's son, with a pet wolf, dark tidings on the horizon, coming of age etc. etc.). But here's the thing: it's the deep and complex characters that really make this story stand out. They bring something new to the table, lifting the story above the usual fantasy fare.Gwynne's world is a blend of the eerie and the captivating, packed with mysteries that unspool in such interesting ways. It's like taking a walk through a familiar forest and finding hidden paths you never knew existed. The characters, young and varied, give a fresh twist to those fantasy tropes we all know. And the way Gwynne plays with ideas of right and wrong, through characters who are both innocent and not-so-innocent, adds real meat to the story. Throw in a climatic ending and *boom* I'm already looking forward to the next one.Plot SummaryMalice is the first book in the epic fantasy series The Faithful and the Fallen. The story is set in the Banished Lands, a world filled with warring kingdoms, ancient prophecies, and magic. It revolves around the age-old conflict between good and evil. The central plot follows the lives of several key characters, primarily young Corban, a blacksmith's son. His life changes drastically as he is swept up in the growing conflict. Corban dreams of becoming a warrior and is unknowingly tied to an ancient prophecy foretelling the coming of a Bright Star & Black Sun. His life will never be the same.World Building: 4/5The Banished Lands, scarred by a distant God War, serves as a rich backdrop where an ancient prophecy foretells the return of this catastrophic conflict. This world, inhabited by a diverse cast including humans, giants, wolvens, draigs, and a knowledgeable talking crow, is meticulously crafted. Despite its reliance on familiar fantasy tropes, these elements are presented with a refreshing twist. Central to the tale are two prophesized champions, the Black Sun and the Bright Star, embodying the classic struggle between good and evil.“I shall stay and tell my tale, hope that it may serve some purpose, that eyes shall see it and learn, that the future will not repeat the mistakes of the past. That is my prayer, but what use is prayer to a god that has abandoned all things . . .”While I thoroughly enjoyed exploring this world, I wouldn't say that it blew me away. Although engaging, it weaves around some rather tropey ideas – tropes that I personally love, but which might feel familiar to seasoned readers of the genre. Gwynne's world-building is both expansive and intricate, yet it treads a path well-worn by fantasy predecessors, striking a balance between the comfort of the known and the allure of a new take on ancient myths.Story Telling: 4/5The story starts off with familiar fantasy vibes - think young teens with big responsibilities, like the classic village boy and the often-ignored youngest son. But Gwynne isn't just playing the same old tune. He takes these typical characters and adds his own twist, making them more intriguing and less predictable.For me, the book's pace was a bit on the slow side. It's heavily focused on character development, which is great for depth but means it takes a while to get into the thick of the action. That said, the mini-action scenes sprinkled throughout are a treat—really well done and add some needed excitement. When you reach the last part of the book, things really pick up, leading to a finale that's all high-stakes and intense action.“Both the brave man and the coward feel the same. The only difference between them is that the brave man faces his fear, does not run.”The ending ties up the storylines in a satisfying way, giving you a good sense of closure without any major cliffhangers. And it's emotionally impactful, too—some of my friends were even brought to tears by it. While the slow start wasn't entirely my cup of tea, I can see how it sets the stage for what promises to be an excellent plot moving forward. Gwynne has a knack for taking the familiar and spinning it into something both comfortable and refreshingly new, making Malice a unique blend in the fantasy genre.Characters: 5/5In ""Malice"" by John Gwynne, the slower pacing might detract a bit from the plot for some, but it's a boon for character development, which is executed brilliantly. The narrative unfolds through seven to eight points of view, all in third-person perspective. This diverse array of viewpoints allows readers to grow alongside the characters, experiencing their development organically over time rather than through rushed exposition or info-dumps.“Storm. I shall call her Storm.”Among the standout characters, Tull, Storm, and Envis particularly resonated with me. Tull's journey of bravery and Envis's descent into something more unhinged are just two examples of the rich, multi-dimensional character arcs Gwynne crafts. The book's strength lies in its ability to present a wide range of complicated personalities—some are immediately likable, while others remain shrouded in mystery.Characters like Nathair, Cywen, Maquin, and Camlin, among nearly 50 others, are skillfully portrayed, each leaving a lasting impression. Gwynne's talent for creating a connection between his characters and the readers is noteworthy. You'll find yourself becoming attached to these characters, and yes, it might hurt, as their journeys and fates are as engaging as they are emotionally impactful.Writing Style: 4.5/5John Gwynne's prose style that is both dynamic and richly textured, making it a standout in the fantasy genre. The action scenes are particularly notable; Gwynne writes these moments with a visceral intensity that is both thrilling and remarkably clear.“History is of value. If more of us took heed of the mistakes of the past, the future could be a different thing.”For me as I read I got strong whiffs of fantasy legends like David Gemmell, J.R.R. Tolkien, and especially Raymond E. Feist in Gwynne's writing. The detailed world he builds and the way he develops his plot and characters have that epic fantasy feel, reminiscent of Feist's style. That's about as high a compliment I can pay John.Enjoyment: 4/5This was a ride with both highs and lows. The ending absolutely nailed it for me, and the characters were a standout – they made the journey worthwhile. I also loved the unique twists throughout.My only real negative was the pacing - which as I've already mentioned was just a little too slow for me. Also, while I enjoyed the familiar tropes and the comfort they bring, the first half of the book did feel a bit too familiar, leaving me craving something a bit more groundbreaking. I do wonder if I'd read this book before Shadow of the Gods (Gwynne's more recent series) if would have liked this more - because that book just set up a lot of expectations in my head as to what his original series was going to be like.With all that said, what really speaks volumes is that I auto ordered the second book in the series after finishing this book. And so maybe my actions are speaking louder than my words.Final Rating: 4.3/5🌕🌕🌕🌕🌗My favourite books of 2023 in preferential order🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕:1.The Shadow of the Gods-(My Review)2.The Grace of Kings-(My Review)3.The Lies of Locke Lamora4.The Forgetting Moon-(My Review)5.The Justice of Kings-(My Review)6.Kings of the Wyld-(My Review)🌕🌕🌕🌕🌗:7.Morning Star-(My Review)8.The Blade Itself-(My Review)9.Red Seas Under Red Skies-(My Review)10.The Escape Artist: The Man Who Broke Out of Auschwitz to Warn the World11.Empire of the Vampire-(My Review)12.Assassin's Apprentice-(My Review)13.Malice-(My Review)14.Golden Son🌕🌕🌕🌕🌑:15.Leviathan Wakes-(My Review)16.The Winter King-(My Review)17.Gardens of the Moon-(My Review)🌕🌕🌕🌗🌑:18.Deadhouse Gates-(My Review)🌕🌕🌕🌑🌑:19.The Song of Achilles-(My Review)20.Red Sister-(My Review)🌕🌕🌑🌑🌑:21.Babel: An Arcane History-(My Review)",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15750692-malice,Malice.txt
The Killing Moon,"The Killing Moon: A challenging and excellently-crafted workOriginally posted atFantasy LiteratureN.K. Jemisin is my favorite fantasy author of this decade. In just six years, she has already established herself as a major force with three fantasy series to date, INHERITANCE (2010-2011), DREAMBLOOD (2012), and BROKEN EARTH (2015~). What makes her so distinctive is her incredible world-building skills, strong and complex characters and themes, and insistence on avoiding the overused conventions of the genre.One of the best and most original fantasies I’ve ever read was her 2015 book, The Fifth Season, the start of the BROKEN EARTH series. In her DREAMBLOOD series, she takes the ancient kingdoms of Egypt and Nubia for inspiration, but rather than simply changing some names and using thinly-disguised history as her template, she introduces an entirely new religious and social system, one centered around worship of Hananja, the dream goddess represented by the moon.In the land of Gujaareh, power is divided between the priest class, the royalty, and the military. But the priest class is the most powerful thanks to its Gatherers, specially-trained priests who harvest dream blood from the sick, dying, and corrupt and use it for healing the sick and injured. So while they provide succor to the suffering on the one hand, they also deal out justice to the corrupt on the other, which makes them far more complex than the usual ‘healer’ role. Because they can delve into people’s dreams, they can also access private thoughts to root out the corrupt.Gatherers take the suffering souls and escort them to the dream world of Ina-Karekh. It is a sacred duty and considered an honor to be sent to the next world. This extends even to the corrupt and criminals, for which it is considered an act of mercy. This theme of euthanasia, or death with dignity, is woven throughout the book. So is the potentially corrupting influence of wielding power in the name of the greater good.The story centers on several main characters: senior priest Ehiru of the Hetawa; his young apprentice Nijiri; Sunandi, a female diplomat and spy from neighboring Kisua; the ambitious Prince Eninket who harbors a dark secret, and many supporting players. The political struggle between the city-states of Gujaareh and Kisua is played out among individuals at various levels of society, and the motivations of both sides are complex and convincing.It is a fully-developed and engrossing world, since the political involvement of the Hetawa priests is so pervasive in Gujaareh. When Ehiru and Nijiri begin to uncover corruption that points to the leaders of the Hetawa itself, they are forced to question the principles upon which their whole lives have been devoted to. We also are shown the political system of Kisua and its Protectors, who are opposed to the use of dream-gathering as they consider it dark and corrupting magic. Many of the most astute social observations come from the diplomat Sunandi, whose role as a spy for her kingdom serves as convenient device to reveal details of the world organically as the story unfolds.There is certainly a flood of neologisms at the beginning of the book, which creates some confusion, so readers will likely be flipping to the glossary to get their bearings (something audio listeners cannot do), and the author eschews exposition in favor of throwing readers into the story from the beginning, then letting us slowly piece together the world and characters she has created. I actually prefer this approach, because it allows the reader to be rewarded with insights into the world without slowing the pace much. So while there is definitely a learning curve, you won’t feel like you’re reading an encyclopedia.It’s also worth mentioning that this books centers of people of dark skin inspired by the ancient kingdoms of Egypt and Nubia, a refreshing change from the dominant influence of medieval Europe on the bulk of epic fantasy, and while this is not an overt element of the story, it is great to tap into such a rich and rarely-used source of inspiration. She also is quite subtle in describing the sexual dynamics of the characters - it is only by mid-story that we discover that same-sex relationships are part of the social fabric in some cases. This becomes particularly poignant for two of the main characters, but I will say no more.There is also a lot of exploration of gender politics and the roles of women in the two societies, something I look forward to when reading her books because she refrains from stacking the deck to favor a given agenda. Instead, her characters are complex in their motivations, and there is a lack of cookie-cutter heroes of villains. Our understanding of the main characters grows throughout the story, as they themselves evolve and struggle with thorny ethical and political struggles. Even the character who turns out to be most ‘evil’ has his own reasons for doing what he does, though he clearly has lost his sense of perspective along the way.Much of the pleasure of the book derives from the slow reveal of the social, religious, and political details of the two societies, so I will not spoil it any further. Suffice to say that Ms. Jemisin has clearly thought it out in great detail and could probably create many stories in this world. But The Killing Moon is self-contained and comes to a dramatic conclusion, though whether it is satisfying or not I will leave to the reader to decide.There is a second book set several years after called The Shadowed Sun, which features some of the same characters but introduces new cultures and perspectives, and dives even further into gender politics and the role of women in this ancient imagined culture. At this point I plan to read everything Ms. Jemisin writes, as she has earned my respect and admiration with her challenging and excellently-crafted work.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11774272-the-killing-moon,The Killing Moon.txt
Last Argument of Kings,"Abercrombie has been titled as Lord Grimdark for years now; I truly believe thatLast Argument of Kingsis majorly responsible for this.“Round and round in circles we go, clutching at successes we never grasp, endlessly tripping over the same old failures. Truly, life is the misery we endure between disappointments.”Last Argument of Kingsis the third—and final book—inThe First Lawtrilogy by Joe Abercrombie. Every plot lines from the first two books lead to the revelations and ruthless conclusion in this installment. The story picks up immediately from whereBefore They Are Hangedleft off, and it has come full circle. Depending on your perspective, theLast Argument of Kingsis either bittersweet, depressingly bleak, or in between; I personally think it’s the latter. Abercrombie writes as if he’s a maestro of death and hopelessness. If you’re hanging on the edge of a cliff, Abercrombie will give you a dangling rope to save you but when you use that rope to save yourself from falling, he annihilates your hopes by using that rope to strangle you when you’re at the top. Yet, I must say that it is precisely for this unforgiving realism that I end up consideringLast Argument of Kingsas my favorite book in the series.Picture:Last Argument of KingsbyAlexander PreussBy this point of the series, I think it’s safe to assume that you—like me—have grown very attached to the utterly memorable characters. Although some of the side character’s story continues in the next standalone trilogy of the series, this is where the main story arcs for the six main POV characters ended. Abercrombie has expertly weaved a tale that exhibited a harsh truth; despite insanely hard works and virtuous intentions, things may not go in our favor just because of one cruel reason: life isn’t fair. If you’re reading this review, and you haven’t startedThe Blade Itself, I’ll suggest you to not expect that a happy conclusion will be reached; you’re not getting one. In my opinion, none of the main characters attained what readers usually consider as a satisfying/happy ending; what they do get, however, is an ending that fits the narrative of the series. Expect an unflinchingly vicious finale, and it’s highly probable that this trilogy will go down as one of your favorite series; it’s certainly one of my favorites. What Abercrombie does well, he does extremely well.“I have learned all kinds of things from my many mistakes. The one thing I never learn is to stop making them.”Speaking of the things that Abercrombie does well, the action scenes in this book were top-class. Out of all the grimdark fantasy series I’ve read, when it comes to close-quarter combat, Abercrombie’sFirst Lawand Jeff Salyards’sBloodsounder’s Arcare always the first to come to mind. Abercrombie has conjured tempestuous war and battle scenes within this finale. We’ve seen glimpses of the deadly magic of the series in the previous two books, but inLast Argument of Kings, Abercrombie displayed the cataclysmic potential of the magic and why they became forbidden to use. The action sequences were bloody, violent, and downright merciless. This is by far the most action-packed and explosive installment in the trilogy; even if I were to include all the books published in the series so far within my assessment—this includesThe Heroes—I’d still putLast Argument of Kingsabove them all, both in quality and quantity.“Travel brings wisdom only to the wise. It renders the ignorant more ignorant than ever.”The war scenes were incredible, but if I were to choose one main highlight of the book, it would have to be the duel scene. If you’ve read this book, you’ll know which confrontation I’m talking about. Back when I first read this duel three years ago, I immediately thought that it was phenomenal; on my reread, I still feel the same way about it. It’s terrifying to me how vivid it was; it honestly felt like I was there. I could hear the sound of swords singing, and I was able to see blood and gore poured from the heart-hammering trade of skills and deathblows unleashed that made the decisive duel unforgettable. Abercrombie has seriously outdone himself in this particular scene. Abercrombie painted a devastating scene that’s incredibly easy to visualize within this circle of death where chaos and the Great Leveller reigns. I’ve read many fantasy novel that features amazing duel scenes, and I can easily vouch that the mighty clash of death here, together with the one inThe Sword of Kaigenby M.L. Wang, are indeed the best duel scenes I’ve ever read in a novel; it was THAT good!“You can never have too many knives, his father had told him. Unless they're pointed at you, and by people who don't like you much. ”It suffices to say thatLast Argument of Kingsis grimdark fantasy at its best, and it is one of my favorite books of all time, simple as that. I loved this book on my first read, and I’m gratified to say that I still absolutely love it on my reread; maybe even more now. Abercrombie is a fantastic writer and storyteller; his characterizations are masterful, his prose is compelling, and his capability in creating vivid cinematic scenes that are brutal, intense, philosophical, and at times hilarious established him as one of the finest authors in the genre. For years now,The First Lawhave often be recommended as a must-read series forA Song of Ice and Firefans and grimdark fantasy enthusiasts. The longevity and the assurance of high quality in this recommendation can exist only if a specific series has received a world-wide qualification and praises from readers around the world. And this is a crowning achievement that Joe Abercrombie, the Lord of Grimdark, has indisputably claimed from this trilogy. If you—somehow—haven’t read this series yet, consider fixing that mistake by readingThe First Lawtrilogy. Now. You have to be realistic about these things.“If you want to be a new man you have to stay in new places, and do new things, with people who never knew you before. If you go back to the same old ways, what else can you be but the same old person?”Series Review:The Blade Itself:5/5 starsBefore They Are Hanged:5/5 starsLast Argument of Kings:5/5 starsThe First Lawtrilogy:15/15 starsYou can order the book from:Blackwells (Free International shipping)You can findthisand the rest of my reviews atNovel NotionsSpecial thanks to my Patrons onPatreonfor giving me extra support towards my passion for reading and reviewing!My Patrons: Alfred, Alya, Annabeth, Blaise, Devin, Diana, Edward, Hamad, Helen, Jimmy Nutts, Joie, Lufi, Michelle, Mike, Miracle, Nicholas, Zoe.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/944076.Last_Argument_of_Kings,Last Argument of Kings.txt
Rivers of London,"Goddammit. I wanted to like this one. I really, really, really did. It has a lot going for it.Midnight Riot, also known asRivers of Londonacross the pond, has, while not the most original premise, certainly an engaging voice. It's got that dry British humor going on, an initially likable hero, an intriguing world and diverse cast, a science(ish)-based magic system, and a POC protagonist who doesn't read like a white guy with a paint job. It was close, SO CLOSE, to enjoyable.Unfortunately, it's first and foremost a blatant male wish-fulfillment fantasy, which I could have endured, if the female characters hadn't ended up a casualty of the male-centric plot.Midnight Riotis heavy on the sexism: sometimes subtle, sometimes...not so much, but present and grating enough to make it a problem for me.Sigh.But let's talk about the good things first for once, eh?Four Things ILikedAboutMidnight Riot:1. It's FunnyAaronovitch knows his stuff.Midnight Riottends towards dry and subversive humor, and Aaronovitch is very good at using characters and archetypes familiar to the genre in funny and unexpected ways. The dialog is, for the most part, sharp and conversations have the sort of timing you'd expect from someone with a history of penning witty television shows.Riotand its world and its characters have the feel of a slightly wacky, weekly supernatural police procedural, and I could easily see it working as one.Not every joke works, of course, but more than anything else the deadpan tone of the novel kept me reading and interested, even through two seriously meandering, disconnected plots, and an often history-heavy narrative.2. It Has a Truly Diverse CastMidnight Riotwas one of the few books with a POC protagonist where I feel like the author didn't just label a white protagonist black or Asian or Native American and been done with it. Peter's race actively impacts his life and his experiences - the way people react to him on the subway, or during a riot, or even in his job, he is aware of how his skin color makes a difference. It's not heavy-handed or preachy or the point of the story, it's just an aspect of Peter's life, and I think Aaronovitch handled that aspect quite well.There's also a higher-than-average number of characters of color, in general. Dr. Walid, the coroner, is Scottish Muslim, and Peter's mother, of course, is an immigrant from Sierra Leon. His love interest, Beverly Brook, the powerful Mama Thames, and the majority of the rivers of London are African women. They all seem to largely avoid stereotypes, though I find the success of Bev and Mama Thames' portrayal a little sketchier - but that has more to do with the treatment of their genders than their race.3. The Magic System is Really, Really CoolI'm not one to give a shit about this sort of thing, usually, butMidnight Riot's science-based magic system caught my fancy. Peter is actually surprisingly inquisitive after he's chosen to begin training as a wizard, and doesn't let the revelation of magic and monsters and ghosts shake his confidence in the laws of science and nature that make up his understanding of the world. Like a hero after my own heart, Peter doesn't just accept that magic works ""because magic"". Instead, he immediately begins applying the laws of physics tothem.Peter questions. He experiments. He formulates theories, and then he tests them, and through his reasoning, we get a basic understanding of how magic works, in more scientific terms than usual. Magical spells are discussed in terms of joules and newtons; conservation of mass, energy, the laws of thermodynamics - they all apply. It's not all hand-waving and mystical force - the magic has consequences.One memorable example is when Peter runs a series of experiments to discover why casting spells results in the destruction of nearby electronics - including his cell phone. After a series of tests, he is not only able to give a reasonable explanation as for why, but also figures out how far the sphere of damage extends, and how to avoid it all together. It's neat stuff.Granted, SCIENCE! can only go so far in explaining supernatural phenomenon, and there comes a time when both Peter and his teacher have to admit that they just don't know how some magic works, scientifically, but there was enough detail that I didn't really mind when we got to that point. What I liked was that the magic was limited; it has rules, it requires repeated practice and study and patience, so Peter can't just whip out a wand and deus ex machina his way through the book with some random badass spell ten levels above his proficiency (though, of course, this doesn't prevent other magical deities from deus ex-ing to their heart's content).The point is, the system more firmly grounds Peter Grant's world in reality than most any other urban fantasy series I've come across. It's well thought-out and detailed, and I appreciate that.4. Peter Grant Has the Potential to be a Cool CharacterI'm of two minds about Peter. On the one hand, I wanted to like him. He's not a dick-head Alpha male convinced he knows better than everyone else. He's actually got an underdog feel: he's not quite attentive enough to be a good police officer, he's best friends with a woman he desperately wants to date, and he's destined for a life of paperwork, until the ghost shows up. He commits to studying magic, but he's still got to practice like anyone else, and he makes plenty of dumb mistakes on the long road to solving the book's mystery. He's just kind of an average guy.So what's the problem? Well, I mean, did you read that last paragraph? Every last bit of that makes Peter a perfect nerd wish-fulfilment insert. He's the meek, ignored, everyday beta-male who ischosen by fateto become the hero, who gets the super-sweet magician's apprentice gig instead of the mundane paper-pushing desk job he dreaded, who saves the day and gets the hot girlfriend and shows all those doubters what's what.One Thing that Utterly KilledMidnight Riotfor MeMisogyny!Given the over-saturation of male wish-fulfillment characters in the general media, this kind of story isn't for everyone, but I really could have gotten past that, if,if, the women hadn't been so completely filtered through this lens. Like, how so much of Peter's story seemed designed to pointedly get the one-up on his dastardly friendzoning female counterpart, Lesley...Read full review atYou're Killing.Us.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9317452-rivers-of-london,Rivers of London.txt
Gardens of the Moon,"Update: This review is still my correct opinion, however having just finished book 3 I would thoroughly recommend reading until that point (end of book 3) before making a call as to whether the series is ""for you"" or not.Final Rating: 3.9/5🌕🌕🌕🌕🌑A grand opening book, that that left me stuck somewhere between ""what the heck is going on?"" and ""Oh my goodness... this is freaken EPIC... I think?""What a journey! From beginnings that had me exclaiming ""ouch my brain"", to a truly EPIC conclusion, Gardens of the Moon is a wild, thrilling rollercoaster of a read... at least once you get past the first half that is... Prepare to be flung headfirst into the depths of the complex Malazan universe, navigating through intricate politics, a mysterious magic system, and a sprawling cast of unforgettable characters.... all while most assuredly NOT having your hand held by Erickson.... because hand holding is for chumps! Chumps I say!... Love it or hate it, for me this is a book that has only left me only craving more. So dive in, but be warned - this is not a journey for the faint of heart!Plot SummaryIn Gardens of the Moon, the first book in Steven Erikson's Malazan Book of the Fallen series, we follow a diverse cast of characters, including soldiers, mages, assassins, and gods, as they navigate the complex world of the Malazan Empire and its ongoing conquest of the Free Cities on the continent of Genabackis. Set against a backdrop of political intrigue, epic battles, and magical confrontations, the narrative delves into the intricate power struggles between the ruthless Malazan Empire, the Free Cities, and enigmatic, god-like beings known as Ascendants, all vying for dominance in a world steeped in ancient history, arcane magic, and hidden secrets.“Ambition is not a dirty word. Piss on compromise. Go for the throat.”World Building: 5/5If there is anywhere where the book really shines, its the incredibly in-depth world that opens before you as you read!Erikson's world-building in Gardens of the Moon totally blew me away, pulling me into this incredibly crafted universe. The main setting is Genabackis, a continent filled with diverse landscapes and cultures. This world is packed with ancient races, like the Tiste Andii, T'lan Imass, and Jaghut, living alongside humans and adding to the complexity of the Malazan universe. The magic system, called Warrens, brings even more depth with its mysterious rules and elemental powers that influence both mages and the world itself.But where Erikson really hits his stride is how he weaves intricate politics and power struggles between the powers that be - i.e the Malazan Empire and the Free Cities of Genabackis. Erikson expertly details everything from Empress Laseen's ruthless plans to the enigmatic motives of the Ascendants, gods mingling with mortals. The political intrigue was just as gripping as the epic battles and magical showdowns. I also really liked how Erikson unveils the world's history and lore through the characters' eyes, letting me gradually immerse myself in the Malazan world and discover its wonders.“Every decision you make can change the world. The best life is the one the gods don't notice. You want to live free, boy, live quietly.""""I want to be a soldier. A hero.""""You'll grow out of it.”Plot: 3/5This was a tale of two halves.Second half Ira: ""The plot unfolded with a captivating blend of political intrigue, epic battles, and magical confrontations. The narrative followed a diverse cast of characters, including soldiers, mages, assassins, and gods, as they navigated the complex world of the Malazan Empire and its conquest of the Free Cities of Genabackis. As the plot progressed, the various storylines began to intertwine just amazingly, creating a rich tapestry that drew me deeper and deeper into the conflict. Because I knew so little of the world, each new unexpected twist and turn left me exclaiming out loud ""no way!"" - I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE a good twist! Indeed, the way Erikson wove together multiple plotlines was nothing short of masterful.""However.....First half Ira: ""Man oh man, this book completely threw me for a loop with its steep learning curve and initial confusion. Erikson just chucks you into this complex world full of loads of characters, intricate politics, and a completely new magic system. This made it pretty tough for me to get into the story, at least at first. Furthermore, the confusion only got worse because he really didn't ""hold my hand"" (his words) or explain things outright. It was left to me to piece together the world and its history through context clues and character interactions. While I can see that this approach eventually led to a greater sense of discovery and immersion, it also demanded a lot of patience and persistence from me as a reader.""Honestly, reading Gardens of the Moon reminded me a lot of trying to read Shakespeare plays in high school english class - plays with an in-built commentary to tell you in plain english what the heck is going on.... If instead of ""in-built commentary"" you mean ""Malazan Reddit pages"", ""Malazan wiki pages"", or the ""Malazan reading guide on the TOR website"". By regularly translating (especially the first half of) the book with these commentaries, I was able to get a better grip on what was happening, which ultimately made the story EPIC. But, let's be real, it's kind of a pain having to read a commentary while you're just trying to enjoy a book in your downtime.“Too many regrets. Lost chances—and with each one passing the less human we all became, and the deeper into the nightmare of power we all sank.”Characters: 3.5/5I loved some of the main characters in this book! Anomander Rake, Rallick, Quick Ben, Tattersail, and Kruppe - all awesome, and that's just me naming a few! I cannot wait to see where their stories end up heading. Indeed, given how confusing the plot was at times, I was flawed at how Erikson managed to make characters that are still so deep and complex. They had genuine emotions, strengths, and weaknesses, which made them feel real and helped me connect with them. Plus, seeing many of their individual journeys and growth throughout the story was pretty satisfying.With that being said though, not all characters in this book are created equally. That is primarily because there are just SO many characters. In all honesty, I found it to be a little overwhelming, making it tough to keep track of everyone (again I had to reference reddit here, ""who was that again?"") and form a strong connection with each of them. To make things worse, a lot of characters had multiple names or titles, which added to the confusion. I think another issue is that, because of the novel's complex plot, some characters didn't get as much development or ""page time"" as others. This left me feeling a bit unsatisfied with certain character arcs. And, of course, the initial confusion with the world-building and plot didn't help when you're trying to appreciate the characters' personalities and motivations.“Convergence,” Tool said. “Power ever draws other power.”Writing Style: 4/5On the positive side, Erikson's prose is rich with description and intricate detail, creating vivid imagery that transported me into the world of the Malazan Empire. I found his use of language to often be poetic and sophisticated, lending a sense of gravitas to the narrative. Moreover, he has a knack for crafting gripping action sequences, making the epic battles and magical confrontations truly come to life on the page. A particular highlight was the sense of grimness and darkness that his writing lent to the world.However, his writing style also has its challenges. I found his penchant for complexity really made the narrative difficult to follow at times, particularly for someone like me who is new to the Malazan universe. Additionally, as I have already mentioned the lack of exposition in favor of revealing information through context and character interactions I found to be both incredibly intriguing (aka twists and discoveries) and frustrating (aka confusing as heck).“High house shadow, and a knife in the dark. A new game's begun, or the old one's just turned.”Enjoyment: 4/5My experience with Gardens of the Moon was a bit of a mixed bag. As someone who is very much a ""Malazan noob"", and having normal expectations for what a fantasy book completely dashed to pieces, in many places I found a lot of this book to be, quite simply, a slog. I really struggled with the steep learning curve, the sheer number of characters, and the complexity of the world.But, here's the thing: no matter how much of a slog something is, I believe it can almost always be redeemed if it nails the ending. And this book NAILED the ending! The way all the plot lines and arcs came together at the end was downright EPIC. It was so satisfying that I'm tempted to go back and read it all again right now, just to catch all the things I missed.So, did I enjoy it? Absolutely! And I'm genuinely looking forward to the ""better"" books waiting for me in the series. But would I recommend it to everyone? No way! This book is clearly not for everyone. If you decide to dive into it, just be prepared for the challenges that come with the territory.Final Rating: 3.9/5🌕🌕🌕🌕🌑My favourite books of 2023 in preferential order🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕:1.The Shadow of the Gods-(My Review)2.The Grace of Kings-(My Review)3.The Lies of Locke Lamora4.The Forgetting Moon-(My Review)5.Memories of Ice-(My Review)6.The Justice of Kings-(My Review)7.Kings of the Wyld-(My Review)🌕🌕🌕🌕🌗:8.Morning Star-(My Review)9.The Blade Itself-(My Review)10.Tress of the Emerald Sea-(My Review)11.Red Seas Under Red Skies-(My Review)12.The Escape Artist: The Man Who Broke Out of Auschwitz to Warn the World13.Empire of the Vampire-(My Review)14.Assassin's Apprentice-(My Review)15.Malice-(My Review)16.Golden Son🌕🌕🌕🌕🌑:17.Leviathan Wakes-(My Review)18.The Winter King-(My Review)19.Of Blood and Fire-(My Review)20.Gardens of the Moon-(My Review)🌕🌕🌕🌗🌑:21.Deadhouse Gates-(My Review)🌕🌕🌕🌑🌑:22.The Song of Achilles-(My Review)23.Red Sister-(My Review)24.The Frugal Wizard’s Handbook for Surviving Medieval England-Babel: An Arcane History-(My Review)",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55399.Gardens_of_the_Moon,Gardens of the Moon.txt
The Willful Princess and the Piebald Prince,"I wish Robin Hobb would write more books like this. Well, I wish she would write more books in general, which speaks volumes considering how many she has already written. Her prose is simply excellent; it is so easily to become lost in it. This book tells the tale of a legend that is often referred to in the Farseer books. So, it’s great to see the story in depth, as it adds a sense of history to her already remarkable novels.An excellent backstoryThe Witted folk often claim to have a kinship with the Farseer line because they believe that the Farseers are descended from their own folk. Their suggestion obviously bares merit because FitzChivallry himself is witted, though this may have come from his mother’s blood line. Either way there is some of the Farseer blood with the hated wit magic. The first part of the story is, essentially, a love story in which a young Farseer Princess falls in love with a Witted stable boy. The story is one of love that could never last because a Princess could never marry someone so below her station. The woe begotten tale unfolds, and the Princess is left with a royal bastard; thus, the wit enters the Farseer blood line.The second part of the story follows a battle of succession. The bastard boy is first in line, but he has the hated wit magic. His conception out of wedlock, and of low lineage, results in the Dukes of the Six Duchies supporting a different claimant: Canny Farseer. If that wasn’t enough reason for the two rival claimants fight they both then fall for the same woman. What unfolds is a somewhat predictable story that ended in bloodshed. I think the first part of the story was much better, and without it, the second wouldn’t have been quite as good. Together though, they provide an intriguing backstory to the Farseer lineage.A great editionVery few authors can write one hundred and fifty pages of prose, and then sell it for £14.99 then at the same time have the reader feel like its money well spent. Indeed, the royal Farseer line has a darker history than I ever imagined. This will be appreciated most by those that have read the The Tawny Man Trilogy and The Farseer Trilogy because the reader will begin to see where the discrimination for the witted folk began. I personally recommend reading it afterFool’s Errand. It adds an excellent backstory to her world and specifically to that book in particular. I wish she would write more tales like this.The book itself looks very good. There are some images that accompany the story, which really help to evoke the nature of Robin Hobb’s writing style. I think the art work is great; it is the same as that on the covers of her books in the U.K. I love the designs. Overall, I really enjoyed reading this, but I found the ending of the overall tale a little predictable. Also because of the short nature of the tale there wasn’t much room for motional investment, which for me is the strongest aspect of her writing. So without it, it felt a little flat.A Witted 3.5 stars",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16244663-the-willful-princess-and-the-piebald-prince,The Willful Princess and the Piebald Prince.txt
Best Served Cold,"I have a Booktube channel now! Subscribe here:https://www.youtube.com/petrikleo4.5/5 starsA magnificent tale of vengeance filled with bloody actions, betrayal, and humor.“One cannot grow without pain. One cannot improve without it. Suffering drives us to achieve great things.”I’ve postponed startingBest Served Cold, the first book inThe First Lawstandalone trilogy by Joe Abercrombie, for almost a year now due to the reason that I thought it will pale in comparison to the first trilogy. I shouldn’t have doubted Abercrombie;Best Served Coldwas exhilarating, and it’s certainly superior compared to many grimdark books published now.Best Served Coldtakes place in the year 579 AU; two years after the events ofLast Argument of Kings. It is now springtime in Styria, and that means war and revenge. The premise of the book is simple. Monza Murcatto has been betrayed by Grand Duke Orso, and the betrayal resulted in her brother’s death and her crippled state. Monza is now determined to assemble her own crew and assassinate the seven personnel responsible for the betrayal. It’s a revenge story similar toAssassin Creed IIorKill Bill, on steroids. The progression of the storyline inBest Served Coldfelt more straightforward compared toThe First Lawtrilogy, but this doesn’t mean it’s a bad thing. As you can expect from Abercrombie, he executed his narrative with brilliance by prioritizing distinctive characterizations and cinematic action scenes. Abercrombie successfully transformed this novel into an incredible story of tension, vengeance, and gore, but enriched with redemption and his trademarked humor.Picture: One of the interior arts by Raymond Swanland forBest Served ColdSubterranean Press editionAmazing characterizations have always been one of Abercrombie’s greatest strengths; it is one of the most dominant factors that separated Abercrombie from so many grimdark fantasy authors. AndBest Served Coldjust proved this notion further. Within a single standalone novel, all six characters with POV chapters received their own background, distinguishable inner voice, unique personality, and superbly-written character development. I do think it will be immensely beneficial for you to readThe First Lawtrilogy first before starting this one. Despite the novel being deemed as a standalone, a lot of characters—or someone related to them—from the first trilogy made an appearance here. For example, both Caul Shivers and Nicomo Cosca were supporting characters inThe First Lawtrilogy and they became some of the main characters in this book. Personally speaking, Shiver and Cosca truly made this book shine, but if Abercrombie should receive a trophy, it is for writing Friendly—a murderer with an obsessive-compulsive disorder towards dice and numbers. I found Friendly to be incredibly compelling and humorous as a character; I absolutely loved reading his POV chapters.“What do the dice say?""Dice say nothing. They are dice.""Why roll'em, then?""They are dice. What else would I do with them?”The dialogues and interactions between characters were insanely delightful and fun to read. Also, once again, Abercrombie exhibited his skill in delivering intricate and immersive action sequences effectively. Abercrombie’s prose never fails to pull me inside the chaos and conflicts; everything always felt so vivid when I’m reading his books. Rest assured that wars, duels, gore, and many other thrilling battle sequences exist inBest Served Cold.Picture: One of the interior arts by Raymond Swanland forBest Served ColdSubterranean Press editionExcluding the spectacular characterization and action scenes, if you’ve read Abercrombie’s book, you would know that he’s a master of crafting memorable catchphrases. I’ll leave those phrases for you to find out for yourself. I would like to, however, direct your attention to these quotes to show how beautifully philosophical his prose can be, in addition to being gritty and witty.“That was the difference between a hero and a villain, a soldier and a murderer, a victory and a crime. Which side of a river you called home.”And this one:“Things aren't what they used to be' is the rallying cry of small minds. When men say things used to be better, they invariably mean they were better for them, because they were young, and had all their hopes intact. The world is bound to look a darker place as you slide into the grave.”Frankly, the only factor stopping me from giving this book a full 5-stars rating was because of Monza Murcatto. One of Abercrombie’s talents as a writer is his ability to craft morally grey characters that felt genuine and lovable; despite their questionable actions, I couldn’t help but found myself rooting for them occasionally. I simply can’t attain that level of investment for Monza. She’s highly selfish, despicable, treated everyone that supported her like garbage. All she did was fuck, order her crew, blame everything on them, and much more. It’s probably intentional, and I do get that this is a grimdark fantasy series, but there’s no redeeming aspect to her personality. Fortunately, despite continuously hoping for retribution to visit Monza’s life, I also felt constantly motivated to find out how her story will proceed and end. I think that’s a testament to how good Abercrombie is. Plus, the multiple third-person POV narration ended up being hugely beneficial to my enjoyment of the novel. I don’t think I would’ve loved this book as much as I did if the entire novel was told exclusively through Monza’s perspective.“You were a hero round these parts. That's what they call you when you kill so many people the word murderer falls short.”I’ll conclude my review here. The first volume of the standalone trilogy inThe First Law Worldturns out to be a fantastic addition, and I honestly believe the overall series is better for it. Contrary to my initial pessimism,Best Served Coldwas an indisputably impressive revenge story. If you’re a fan ofThe First Lawtrilogy, do not stop there; continue toBest Served Cold. You might find yourself surprised by how awesome it was like I did.

Before They Are Hanged,"""No cabe duda de que soy una figura trágica. Antes era una mierda de hombre y ahora soy la sombra de un hombre. Elija al que más le guste""""Antes de que los cuelguen"", segunda entrega de ""La Primera Ley"" que da comienzo donde se quedó ""La Voz de las Espadas"". La narración continua contada por la mano de los personajes siguiendo sus aventuras y desventuras. La mayor parte de la trama se desarrolla en tres lugares diferentes del Círculo del Mundo creado por Abercrombie, el norte, el sur y el oeste. La larga pero no lenta ni falta de calidad introducción que fue el primer libro da sus frutos de una manera magnífica en esta segunda entrega, donde todo comienza a ir al grano, con la historia llegando a su apogeo, y es aquí donde comienzan las grandes escenas y momentazos tanto de la trama como de los personajes.""El honor, ¿eh? ¿Se puede saber qué es eso? Cada hombre piensa que es una cosa distinta. Cuanto más se tiene, peor sienta, y si no tienes nada, jamás lo echas en falta. Y, sin embargo, algunos hombres piensan que no hay nada más importante en el mundo""Abercrombie da un paso más en la historia que está desarrollando, en esta segunda entrega vemos que ha aumentado tanto la calidad de la propia trama, la evolución de los personajes como también el nivel de entretenimiento y enganche que somete al lector. Lo que más destaca una vez más son la maravilla de personajes, aquí sí ha subido la calidad conforme va avanzando la historia. La perspectiva de cada uno de ellos fue inmensamente interesante de leer. Aunque puedo decir con total seguridad que, Glokta sigue en la cima. Que pedazo personaje, me encanta, cada uno de sus capítulos se disfrutan muchísimo, por lo que hace, dice o decide con esa personalidad y humor que tiene, estamos ante un personaje de diez, de matricula de honor. En esta segunda parte se nota el aumento en la calidad por que ser capaz de elegir qué perspectiva me gustó más leer en esta entrega, es difícil, quitando a Glokta, es un asunto difícil, por que el ritmo y la ágil progresión de cada trama y personajes que ha logrado Abercrombie, fueron absolutamente una gozada.""Ah, la flor y nata de la joven nobleza de la Unión. Casi se siente en la atmósfera la fragancia de la honra. ¿O es que alguien se ha tirado un pedo?""La genial y ágil narrativa de Abercrombie junto los personajes con sus momentazos, cambios y la trama ya estallando hacía su máximo esplendor nos da la sangre que se veía venir en el primer libro con unas escenas de acción y guerra que te cagas. Tenemos un tercer y último libro ""El Último Argumento de los Reyes"" más largo que sus predecesores, aquí el instinto grita por todo lo que promete cada página, que puedo decir, maravilla, es una jodida maravilla. Cuando termine esta saga me voy directamente a la siguiente, luego a los libros independientes que tiene y luego a rezar y pedirle a, Abercrombie de rodillas que por favor saque más. Eso es uno de los muchos logros que para mi consigue, que quieras más por que se va superando. Para mi es una GOZADA leer a este señor.Tenemos giros y vueltas de calidad, algunas de ellas impredecibles que me mantuvieron sentado pegado al libro y en la otra mano, la cerveza. Nos muestra emociones y sentimientos como la lealtad, la codicia, amistades improbables, la presión de las responsabilidades y la guerra, todo esto en el aspecto narrativo, está muy bien integrado en la trama, consiguiendo resultados efectivos. Disfruté de buenas escenas.Las caracterizaciones de los personajes fueron, una vez más, lo mejor del libro. Abercrombie utilizó con mucho éxito una base que estableció en el primer libro que es el desarrollo de sus geniales personajes revelando sus personalidades, sus formas de ser y actuar en lo bueno y sobretodo en lo malo. Ya que aquí rebosa de oscuridad, esa sucia, cruel y mortal forma de ser que tienen muchos de ellos para sobrevivir y lograr pasar un día más en el mundo y no terminar el día con sus cadáveres flotando en el río o siendo un exquisito manjar para los cuervos.""Extraña cosa la muerte. En la distancia, todos nos reímos de ella, pero, a medida que se acerca su aspecto nos parece cada vez peor. Y cuando esta tan cerca que ya casi podemos tocarla, se acaban las risas""Aquí vemos a esos personajes ya sean conocidos o nuevos darlo todo de sí mismos para bien o mal en las circunstancias extremas que les toca vivir. Fue intenso, muchas veces divertido. Abercrombie no tiene ningún miedo o reparo en hacer que sus personajes pasen por un sufrimiento intenso, dolor, ira, odio, venganza, envidia... de vuelta al barro. En otras palabras los sumerge en la mierda más absoluta y la sangre sin cortarse un solo pelo. Abercrombie muestra la capacidad mortal de la vida dura, la guerra, los efectos y cambios que esto conlleva, en general o en un solo individuo, acabe de la manera que acabe.Las enormes dificultades a las que se enfrentaron los personajes en esta segunda entrega en sus respectivas misiones o aventuras trajeron consigo desarrollos espectaculares a cada uno de ellos y llevadas con una gran precisión de cirujano por parte de, Abercrombie.""¿Se convertiría en uno de esos tullidos con los que evitaba cruzarse en las calles? ¿Uno de esos heridos de guerra, sucios y harapientos, que mendigaban unas monedas, un desagradable recordatorio de que la vida militar tenía un lado oscuro que era mejor relegar al olvido?""He de mencionar algo que me llama mucho la atención, puede parecer algo sencillo incluso simple ya que se puede pasar por alto, pero si tiene un resultado perfecto como es el caso es digno de mención y es que, Abercrombie sabe como crear y repetir frases míticas en la saga, además puestas en el momento exacto y adecuado para mejorar los momentos memorables. Como pueden ser: ""Sigo vivo"", ""Nunca se tiene demasiados cuchillos"" o ""¿Por qué lo hago?"". Pueden parecer simples, pero las convierte en frases memorables que le dan a esta saga un pequeño toque unico y especial.""¿Es que ya se ha olvidado de quién soy? —gimoteo riéndose, mientras en sus ojos humedos latía una repulsiva mezcla de dolor y diversión-. Me presento, soy el superior, Glokta, encantado de conocerla. Me importa un carajo lo que haga, y usted lo sabe. ¿Amenazas a mí? ¡Más le vale que pruebe con otra cosa, maldita pelirroja!""Además amigos y amigas, tenemos a el puto Sand Dan Glokta. Disfruté como no hay palabras leyendo la perspectiva de, Glokta. Es un placer leer por todo lo que pasa, piensa y hace el cabroncete; la complejidad de su carácter, el contraste entre sus palabras habladas y sus pensamientos internos son muy divertidos, y siempre logra que espere con ansias su próximo capítulo. La cantidad y calidad de las escenas de acción, tanto pequeñas escaramuzas como batallas a gran escala, también han mejorado y mucho, aquí ya tuve mi buena dosis de acción, muerte, guerra y sangre. Todo está perfectamente narrado de manera ágil, sencillo a la hora de leerlo pero muy detallado, con control, conocimiento y logrando ser muy visual.En el primer libro la construcción del mundo o ""worldbuilding"" solo se mostró un poco, dejándolo de lado y centrándose en otras cosas. Esta segunda parte ya nos muestra más cosas, especialmente del pasado, del origen, ya que reveló algunas de las historias del Círculo del Mundo, principalmente con respecto a, la Primera Ley, gracias a las historias contadas por, Bayaz. Tenemos una construcción de mundo inmersiva y detallada, quizas no al nivel de otros autores que van más al detalle pero esta muy bien, tiene un aprobado y lo más importante cumple con su propósito en la historia y la trama. Además aquí tenemos un buen ejemplo de lo que sería, para mi, una exitosa secuela, no vemos lo que pasa en otras trilogías en las que el segundo es un puente hacía el tercero, en el que nos encontramos un ritmo pausado y cosas que sobran. Tenemos una secuela asombrosa, llena de progresiones en la trama, desarrollos de personajes muy bien llevados y ejecutados y también muy buenas escenas, de las que logran llamarte la atención y se quedan en la memoria, me gustó cierta escena en la que se habla sobre cicatrices.""Como un hombre que se dispone a hacer una propuesta de matrimonio. O de traición. Me pregunto cuál de las dos será""Me gusta lo que logra conseguir, Abercrombie con sus personajes hacia mi como lector, sus personajes grises, matan, torturan pero desde las primeras páginas del primer libro les vas conociendo, sus personalidades, su pasado y sus razones.. si es que las tienen, son tan reales. Y tienen el efecto de convertirse en personajes por los que te preocupas, especialmente por la tendencia y falta de miedo por parte de su autor de usar el hacha y matar a quien tenga que matar xD. Preocuparme hasta por el imbécil de, Jezal que quizás se merezca todo lo que le viene. Logen el Sanguinario su apodo ya lo dice todo y he de decir que tiene unas idas de olla bastante importantes. Y así podría seguir hablando de los personajes pero no quiero contar nada más, disfrutadlo, solamente con los personajes, tenéis una trilogía de mucha calidad, si sumas el resto de cosas que tiene, que decir. Esta segunda parte me pareció mucho más conmovedora, emocionante, con momentazos y batallas.""Tal vez fuera un monstruo, pero allí, en las heladas y salvajes tierras de Angland, las normas eran otras. Los monstruos estaban en mayoría""Abercrombie hizo un trabajo exquisito al imbuir cada línea de la trama con un sentido de tensión que me mantuvo al borde del sofá pegado al libro. Mención también a las escenas de sexo, después de las escenas de los libros de, Richard Morgan en ambas sagas tanto su CF como su grimdark, las escenas de sexo que nos muestra, Abercrombie en este libro me han gustado y fueron un tanto impredecibles. Son un tanto curiosas e incómodas situaciones y lugares para poder tener sexo, pero sin duda son las más divertidas que he leído xD.Se tomaron decisiones y se alcanzaron resultados que fueron increíbles para bien o para mal. Cuando lees a Abercrombie tienes una cosa muy clara, que no habrá arcoíris y finales de ""vivieron felices y comieron perdices"". Aquí no hay nada bonito, no te enseña lo agradable del ser humano, es muy oscuro, sin piedad y mostrando la sucia ¡realidad! de la vida y del mundo en el que viven los personajes. Es vivir o morir, o alcanzas el éxito o de vuelta al barro. Y no rompe con esa realidad ya que todo dejaría de ser creíble. Ha preparado muy bien el camino para un tercer y último libro de 900 maravillosas páginas que espero me dejen boquiabierto, sea cual sea el destino del mundo y de los personajes espero con ansias leer el final, con""El Último Argumento de los Reyes""espero unos malditos.. ESCALOFRÍOS.""Debemos perdonar a nuestros enemigos, pero no antes de que los cuelguen""",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/902715.Before_They_Are_Hanged,Before They Are Hanged.txt

Brightly Burning,"Mercedes Lackey's Valdemar is a brightly drawn, vivid world, perhaps not terribly unique in its particulars, but remarkable enough in terms of its social & magical structures. Unfortunately, at least in the case ofBrightly Burning, the world is populated by flat, unlikable, and inconsistent characters. Furthermore,Brightly Burningsuffers from a plot that is hastily conceived and poorly executed.Lavan Chitward's life is suffering. At the start of the book it was a struggle to determine how much of Lan's struggle was meant to be sympathetic, and how much of it was meant to be hilarious. There's some overblown teen angst because his parents just don't understand him and he doesn't want to have a job or do chores or anything like that, so instead they send him to a school where he is mercilessly bullied. I feel like this was the part of the book that gripped me the most -- there was emotional tension, palpable danger, and I felt like Lan grew as a character during his time at school. However, Lan's gift soon awakens and he moves on to the Collegium.As a new reader to Lackey's Valdemar, I found the structure of the Collegium fun & engaging, if not particularly inspired. Still, the plot started to drag here -- by the time the midwinter festivities rolled around, I was struggling to finish a chapter per day. Strangely, the narrative doesn't really pick up from that point onward -- there's about as much time devoted to inconsequential travel as there is to the big climax at the end. Which, I think, highlights the fact that the book suffered badly from a lack of conflict. The bullies in the first portion of the narrative provide a source of conflict, but once they're dealt with, and all the loose ends concerning that are tied up, there's no real driving force behind the narrative. Of course there's the war with Karse, but it's strangely absent from the narrative, and, as another reviewer noted, feels tacked on. I guess the foreshadowing at the beginning of the book implied a very different story than the one I eventually got.Furthermore, while the writing itself was perfectly serviceable, even enjoyable, there were two big weaknesses to the craft of the novel: (1) dialogue, which bordered on unrealistic and even hokey at times, and (2) action sequences, which were especially notable towards the end of the book where we got detailed descriptions of the armies' movements, but no real sense of the battle, or of the impact of the battle. Furthermore, several times the same sequence of events were retold from both Lan and Pol's perspective with nothing unique or valuable added to the retelling.Still, the greatest flaw in the book lies, at least for me, with its characters. I failed to get a firm grasp on Lavan as a character. He started off as a whiny teenager and grew into someone with very little in the way of personality. Was he witty? He had his moments, but they were few and far between. Was he observant? Some of his comments would lead us to think so, but considering how absurdly obvious he was to Elenor, I would hesitate to attribute this characteristic to him. He was certainly (and understandably) angry, but aside from some (very understandable) reactions, I got no sense of character from him.Similarly, Pol and Tuck also fell flat. Pol was the generic mentor/dad and Tuck was the token best friend who was conveniently capable of whatever quality was necessary. Kalira had some personality, but since all her interactions were reactionary to Lan she was similarly hard to pin down. I guess I rather liked Elenor, which meant that this book was certainly not for me. Indeed, Elenor's treatment was abhorrent -- she's constantly dismissed as whiny, naive, useless, and stupid (even by her own parents). For the last half of the book she has this completely inexplicable crush on Lan that serves no narrative purpose. It's never acknowledged, it never causes anything to happen, and her presence is ultimately completely meaningless to the plot. I was expecting her to sacrifice herself for Lan or something similarly tragic, but she mostly just mooned over him then got over it.And, to tackle the elephant in the room, I was pretty weirded out by the whole life-bond thing with Lan and Kalira. Not necessarily because it was a dude in love with his not!horse (though that was strange) but because it happened to immediately. It was just mentioned off hand for the purpose of causing Elenor angst (to no real end) and didn't play much of a role except in the last fifteen pages or so of the novel. I really would've been okay with the life-bond if there had been some growth or acknowledgement of it, but it was mostly a vehicle for the tragedy at the end which made it feel cheap, rather than meaningful.I'm intrigued enough by the world to try other Valdemar novels by Lackey, butBrightly Burningitself was a disappointment and a trial to read.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/176827.Brightly_Burning,Brightly Burning.txt
The Sword of the Land,"I have read a few books from this author, and she seems to carry through with a ""woman-is-superior"" theme throughout them all. Rilsin is by far the most overkill and cliche of this standpoint. The story itself is very interesting, complete with twists and political intrigue. But Rilsin is so annoying! Little do-good-ing, swashbuckling, prize-winning, number one hottie, justice-girl. It's a little difficult to swallow. I was waiting for her to do something wrong--because people usually do...Online cliche character test results were off the charts.But I really liked the subtle tension that grew into a competition with Sithli, as well as the growth that we saw in Sifuat. Sifuat turned out to be my favorite character. I found his flaws lovable, since he was the only realistic and believable character in the book. Everyone else was just too starchy and perfect...like braid-boy...what was his name? Sofa? (Sola...) Solar Panels. There you go. He probably invents those in book two.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1267130.The_Sword_of_the_Land,The Sword of the Land.txt
The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms,"“Live,” I said. “Why else do you think I put you here?”Why else? Why else indeed? I have a because... Because, at this point in time, 2:43pm GMT+3 in the year of our lord Beyonce Giselle Knowles C◼️◼️◼️◼️◼️ 2022, I believe I was officially put on this earth to shout about HOW AMAZING THIS BOOK IS.If I was a booktuber I'd be making indecipherable noises as a gush review. If I was a competent bookstagrammer, I'd create an edit that is so epic, it would revolutionize Instagram as we know it. But alas, I am neither. I am just a girl, standing in front of her work computer, begging all the faceless strangers scrolling down their screens who will come across this review, to PLEASE READ THIS BOOK.Can you tell how much I loved it?! CAN YOU? My god, I think I'm vibrating.The story starts with our main protagonist Yeine dau she Kinneth tai wer Somem kanna Darre, daughter of Kinneth Arameri, ennu of the Darre people, leader of tribe Somem but before you can parse the significance of Yeine's full name, she informs us that tribes have become insignificant since the Gods' War.But I'm getting ahead of myself. The story doesn'treallystart there. In this universe, the Big Bang's equivalent is the Maelstrom where the deities Itempas and Nahadoth were created from nothingness. However, even before that, according tothis New Yorker article,it all started witha dream vision of two gods. One had dark-as-night hair that contained a starry cosmos of infinite depth; the other, in a child’s body, manipulated planets like toys. From these images, Jemisin spun out a four-hundred-page story about an empire that enslaves its deities.Yeine is the mixed race daughter of the Darre chief and the former princess of the Arameri, the ruling family of the Amn people. Her mother, Kinneth, dared to defy their caste system and marry a man who is ""beneath"" her.My father dared ask my mother to dance; she deigned to consent. I have often wondered what he said and did that night to make her fall in love with him so powerfully, for she eventually abdicated her position to be with him. It is the stuff of great tales, yes? Very romantic. In the tales, such a couple lives happily ever after. The tales do not say what happens when the most powerful family in the world is offended in the process.Hook me, baby.Yeine has been summoned by her grandfather, Dekarta, ruler of all mankind. He ignored for her nineteen years but suddenly he wanted her in Sky, the city where the Arameri live, where they have enslaved their gods and the children of these gods.This book isn't Jemisin's best work. It's even self-aware,Such a convoluted patchwork to piece together.There is a certain amateurishness that's hard to ignore, especially after seeing the excellence of her prose inThe City We Became. The world building is sound. The characters solid but there was a certain elusive quality in the delivery. Perhaps this was because the story was in first person with the language a bit simpler than the indulgent decadence of her latest book. I ended up reading some scenes too quickly and felt I had missed something and even upon reread it would elude me such that when a reveal came about I felt that if the prose had been a bit denser, I'd have connected the dots sooner.The story has three main running cogs. The war of the gods, the mystery behind the death in Yeine's family and why she has been summoned by her grandfather. And while everything was resolved satisfactorily, I still felt I needed more. At no point does the quality of this book suffer but I am a sugar addict and I wanna dance in cake damnit. I needed about three hundred more pages and at least two more perspectives. I needed to linger. However that doesn't matter when you have a lord of darkness who looks like this.Nahadoth by sorskc (DeviantArt)He is everything my emo self would ever imagine in a god. And he is banging....here was no human flesh to filter his cool majesty. His eyes glowed blue-black with a million mysteries, terrifying and exquisite. When he smiled, all the world shivered...ShiverMEtimbers baby.Another favourite is the trickster god, Sieh. Imagine the adorableness of Avatar Aang (seriously Sieh moves with globes too) and the deviousness of Loki. Not MCU Loki. Actual Loki. I adored him with everything that I am.The book does interrogate existence. When Yeine is asked what she wants out of life, she—understandably—whines at her lot in life which is er a lot, Naha scolds her“You are what your creators and experiences have made you, like every other being in this universe. Accept that and be done; I tire of your whining.”There is also commentary on class, agency, gender roles, colonization, freedom, free will. What's radical about this book is how it's thegodswho are oppressed. The most powerful beings whocausedCREATION are the ones subjugated. To undo or reform this level of oppression, a lot has to explode. Bang goes that revolution.Aside from such grasping and provocative material, this book gave me something I didn't even realise I was missing. Having been in the dumps for what feels like forever, I think I'd forgotten what joy felt like. With everything that is happening in the world, with how miasmic my personal life is, I didn't realise how I'd settled into unhappiness. I'd forgotten to find joy. I still laughed. I still listened to music. I still felt at peace when I sat on my balcony listening for silence between the rain drops to a Norah Jones soundtrack. But I was not joyful. No.When I started this book, I was on a commute to the city centre to collect a package. My city is one which fills you with rage unfailingly. No matter what happens, you will be angry every time you enter, stay and leave Nairobi. This ugly concrete behemoth seeps bitterness into all. As I waited for my bus to fill up so I could escape the godforsaken beast's belly, I decided to open up Libby on a whim. I don't know what prompted me but I decided to search Jemisin and lo and behold, Hundred Thousand Kingdoms was ready for me to borrow. Ignoring the protests of the rest of my tbr, I acquired the book and got to reading. By the time I was alighting, I was running to the house so I could settle down and continue reading. Whenever life happened, I would wish for it to hasten so I could get back to my book.It had plenty of moments happened that filled me with so much giddiness. My favourite was when Yeine had an altercation with her cousin, Scimina, who is an heir to Dekarta's throne.“It will do for now.”“For now?” Scimina stared at me, incredulous, then began to laugh.“Oh, Cousin. Sometimes I wish your mother were still alive. She at least could have given me a real challenge.”I had lost my knife, but I was still Darre. I whipped around and hit her so hard that one of her heeled shoes came off as she sprawled across the floor.“Probably,” I said, as she blinked away shock and what I hoped was a concussion. “But my mother was civilized.”I was on my feet after that scene. This book is pure excitement. I haven't had the rush to read the next scene, playing the just one chapter game at bedtime, this pure unadulterated joy—something childlike and inchoate of the pollution of reality—in a long time. And for that, this book gets the most resounding five stars.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6437061-the-hundred-thousand-kingdoms,The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms.txt
Songs of Love and Death: All-Original Tales of Star-Crossed Love,"I want to savor these stories little by little because they are so darn good but I find myself rushing through them needing to know what happened next!! I find this anthology so far to be quite fascinating and I am enjoying myself immensely reading through the creative and varied voices within these 'songs'.JACQUELINE CAREY: this was the first story that I chose - and quite purposefully, at that. It was of Anafiel Delunay, who was once known as Anafiel de Montreve, a poet that was good enough to become the King's Poet and perhaps more but such events were not meant to be for himself and his star-crossed lover. This story about Phedre's mentor fills in a small chink of his life before he became known as the Whoremaster of Spies and the compass by which Phedre lived her life using knowledge he ingrained within her towards the one promise he made to his star-crossed lover and one that Phedre will see fulfilled. I cannot tell you how excited I was to read this story. It was brilliant, poignant, and heart-wrenching. The first Kushiel trilogy is still to this day my all-time favorite trilogy that I have ever read and I will always have copies of the Kushiel series in my bookshelf. THIS story was the reason that I had to have this book so quickly after coming out. When I heard that Ms. Carey had a new Kushiel story for us set in Phedre's time I was already sold - and I don't regret it one bit.NEIL GAIMAN: This was my second stop in this collection as Neil is probably second on my list of authors due to his wit, versatility, and charm and it was very much... unexpected, actually, but in a good way. There is a fun twist at the end of this story that I won't spoil for you. It's a fun read about a mythical past and what happens when that path has never been or perhaps has outlived its usefulness? I'm not sure. Either way I quite liked it. Not my favorite of Neil's short stories but a good solid read nonetheless.JIM BUTCHER: I admit that I've only read the first two Harry Dresden books as pushed onto me from a guy friend numerous years back. I felt that the writing was tight, the story was well-written and interesting, I liked the main character, but... it just never stuck with me. However, reading a new mini-chapter in Mr. Dresden's life was kind of fun even if I missed out on some of the obvious references to character stories that I would have easily gotten if I had continued with the story - the selfsame references that I relished with glee while reading Ms. Carey's story above. A good little peek into Harry's life though it still hasn't convinced me to pick up the third Dresden File.JO BEVERLY: I can't say that I have read any of her books before so this was my first foray into her writing style which seems to read like a tame Regency Romance. While I liked the idea of an unwilling bride (a ""marrying maid"") that must be wed and bed before a certain young viscount's birthday or his whole family would die due to the machinations of certain faery royals it fell a bit flat and forced for me near the end as if there was a page-limit that needed to be - and was - enforced strictly. The ending seemed far too rushed and I felt it needed at least a couple more pages to be fleshed out with far more arguments and 'accidental' encounters in true Regency fashion.CARRIE VAUGHN: I wasn't quite sure about this story. I felt thrown into a world where superheroes seem to be a thing of them norm (very Watchmen-like) as it followed a brief glimpse into Charlotte's hectic playwright lifestyle as she gets ready for her play's opening night. The night before the show opens she gets taken hostage for a brief moment, gets rescued by a masked man - a ""blue collared"" superhero - and the consequences of that moment which change her life. A good idea but ultimately forgettable.M. L. N. HANOVER - A dark and gritty ghost story. It was a quick read with a small twist at the end that was not altogether very surprising. It was definitely a different take on the death and love theme which was a nice change of pace.CECELIA HOLLAND - A new spin on a classical fairytale idea: a once-pretty girl becomes disfigured in a fire but is given a chance to become beautiful once more as the companion queen to a wizard king but all is not as it seems in his land and she wakes every night from incubus dreams. She must make the decision to stay with the wizard or find a way to return home to a plain boy that seems to love her. The moral of this story is a common one - that nothing comes for free. This was another short story that seemed to jump around rather quickly and I would also have liked to see it fleshed out a bit more as it felt far too short because events were happening far too quickly for my liking. I could definitely see this as idea for a novel-sized book but with that said I'm not sure I'd pick it up if I saw it at a bookstore.MELINDA M. SNODGRASS - A slice-of-like space story with the rescue and reunion of a disgraced tailor's son who is currently captain of a small merchant vessel and the heiress of an empire who also happens to be his former love. I am an avid fan of Firefly and somehow I could sort of see this story in that world, just a bit, when thinking of Capn. Reynolds and Inara. While I don't tend to like sci-fi stories I was quite pleased that this one used far less technical jargon and focused on the emotional rollercoaster of the two main characters. If there were more sci-fi stories written by Ms. Snodgrass I'd consider giving them a whirl.ROBIN HOBB - Awww, I really liked this story. It was a typical, sweet, fairytale and one that flowed well and fit well as a short story. It starts in the middle of a 17 year old girl's life after her father's death as a helpmaid at a Keep. She spies black-haired minstrel there and... well... I'm sure you can figure out the gist. A well-written and fun little story that made me smile at the end of it. One of my new favorites of this anthology, even if it was saccharine sweet (and rather unrealistic).MARJORIE M. LIU - This was probably one of my least favorite stories in this collection. It takes place in a post-apocalyptic future following a brief glimpse into a woman's life as she deals with darker creatures. It reminded me a bit of Richard Matheson's ""I Am Legend"" and just didn't appeal to me at all. I ended up skimming large swaths of it to get through this story.LISA TUTTLE - A short story about a woman and a wolf and the problems that the wolf's owner faces as he tries to get out of his drug dealing ways so that way he can be respectable - with a slight twist at the end. It was well-written and I enjoyed it but was not enthralled.LINNEA SINCLAIR - Another story that takes place in the future but a technologically advanced one at that meaning that I'm already inclined to be less interested because it is sci-fi in nature. So it was not a surprise that I found this story rather boring and I skimmed through most of it.MARY JO PUTNEY - I'm hesitant to say if I liked this story or not. It flowed and I liked the characters - with a hardened and handsome magically inclined detective and his favorite person, an elderly lady of the same magical persuasion he fondly calls ""Lady Beth"" - but the ending had an odd twist that I wasn't exactly expecting. Still, not a bad read.TANITH LEE- I am an avid Tanith Lee fan so I very much looked forward to reading her story - and I was not disappointed. It took place in the future - and in the past. It was about a man and one woman - but then a different man and a different woman. Stories that became entwined, chance encounters that never happened but perhaps should have, and star-crossed lovers that missed many lifetimes before they could find one another. A fun and imaginative read. I was impressed and pleased by this story.PETER S. BEAGLE - An alien encounter through a bizarre computer using 'The One Key' to communicate. Not what I expected from the man who wrote ""The Last Unicorn"" but it wasn't bad just different. And a different take on what 'love' means. It was written strictly from the protagonists' perspective whom I didn't garner great feelings for so ultimately the story fell a little flat for me.YASMINE GALENORN - A sad, sweet ghost story that drifts softly, silently on tiny cat paws through the pages swiftly read and enjoyed. A woman with a traumatic past moves into her ex's family house and gets to know his aunt - and the cousin that died years before. It was prettily written and kept me interested so that I finished this story in record time. Recommended.DIANA GABALDON - Another time-traveling story from the the horrors of WWII back through the standing stones and back again. It was nice to get a side-story from the Outlander series (one of my all-time favorite series behind Jacqueline Carey's Kuhiel trilogies) but I was very much not a fan of ""Echo in the Bone"" - I couldn't even finish it because I just stopped caring about the characters that were not Jaime and Claire - so the reference to that book and the mysterious men Jerry meet in the past was frustrating because I had stopped reading ""Echo"" before that point. All in all an ok side-story but not an amazing one. Mrs. Gabaldon still writes well-researched tightly written stories but I'm having a hard time with her work as of recently because I'm not really getting into anything she has written after ""Drums of Autumn"". I was really looking forward to this story as well but was a bit disappointed in the end. Ah well. These things happen.I can't believe I took the time to write little blurbs for each story in this anthology. More often than not I felt ho-hum about what was written but I am leaving my 4-stars up (rather than pushing back to 3) because the stories that stood out really stood out. While these stories seemed far from new and illuminating they were still good fun to skip through and I generally enjoyed them all. I don't feel as if I wasted time in reading them which is always a good thing. I suppose the strength that comes with anthologies is that if you don't like a story much you can always skip it and find a new author and a new voice to continue your journey along with.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7841656-songs-of-love-and-death,Songs of Love and Death All-Original Tales of Star-Crossed Love.txt
Half a War,"Originally reviewed atBookwraiths.I’m a completionist at heart, especially when it comes to reading. When I’ve experienced most of a story, a part of me demands to know how it all ends – even if I have not “loved” the overall series. And this character trait explains why Half a War ended up on my reading list afterHalf a KingandHalf the Worldunderwhelmed me.As this tale begins, three years or so have passed since the events in book two. The Shattered Sea is now ripped apart by war. Gettland and Vansterland staring down the High King. So far though, the alliance between King Uthil and Grom-gil-Gorm has accomplished little, as their ally Throvenland’s fall clearly illustrates. But the deeply cunning (and clearly ruthless) Father Yarvi has schemes within schemes, plots within plots that he has been slowly brewing, waiting patiently to gain his vengeance against Grandmother Wexen, and now the time for true war has come!This titanic clash between Father Yarvi’s rebellion and Grandmother Wexen’s loyalist is seen through the eyes of three, new point of view characters: Princess Skara of Throvenland, Koll from Half the World, and Raith, sword bearer and cupbearer for Gorm. Very different people who begin this journey with their own unique circumstances, yet quickly find themselves drawn into the swirling vortex surrounding Yarvi. Events playing out around them which they have little to no control over. The hellish toils of war escalating, turning deadly and personal until it builds to a classic Abercrombie ending, where everything and everyone is painted in absolute grey, not a single hero in sight.Wow, that sounds rather exhilarating, doesn’t it? A rousing and bloody conclusion to this grimwhine series, and there are many things to like here.Action and bloody combat heads my list. All of the warfare realistically portrayed. Abercrombie fully capturing the brutality of regicide and warfare in this post-apocalyptic world. Death, mayhem, and deceit reign supreme. Sacrifices are made. Lies are told. Innocents die needlessly. Betrayals occur. Alliances are forged then broken. Revenge is served: both the hot and cold varieties. All of it drenched in the author’s cynical view of people; the philosophy that one person’s hero is another person’s villain clearly portrayed.The true origins of the Shattered Sea is also revealed here. Not fully perhaps, but enough that the mysterious “elves” of the ancient past do come more into focus. This advanced civilization’s fall is hinted at; their poisonous and creepy ruins examined up close; and their lost technology plays a vital role in the conclusion. Abercrombie finally delivering on the promise of this ancient place.Even acknowledging these strengths, I rated this book as a two star novel, which means it was merely “okay” in my eyes. Let me explain why.For the third time in three books, Mr. Abercrombie chose to tell his story with all new point of view characters. That means this is the third time I’ve been introduced to new people, had to learn to either empathize or hate them, and seen the same overarching plots retold through the eyes of new characters. At the same time as this is taking place, the trilogy has to wrap up: the stories of Yarvi, Wexen, Uthil, Grom, Thorn, and Brand ending as well as the epic, world changing war concluding. And for all Mr. Abercrombie’s writing skills, he was not able to do all this and still make me feel the same depth of emotional attachment for Skara, Koll, and Raith as I did the stars ofHalf a Kingor evenHalf the World. Rather, our fresh faced trio turned into the latest faces in the Shattered Sea revolving door.This lack of fully realized characters did not cause my next complaint, but it certainly did not alleviate it. What I’m referring to is the main protagonists inHalf a Warnot being in control or even fully knowledgeable about what is actually going on. Instead of being in the thick of the decision making and plots in this titanic conflict, our trio are always on the outside peaking in like a bunch of kids eavesdropping on the grownups party. Sure, every once in a while the “adults” like Yarvi, Grom, or Thorn will talk to them, pat them on the head, or pass along a tidbit of what is going on inside, but the bulk of the time, Skara, Knoll, and Raith are out of the loop, not in the inner circle, bumbling around in the dark. Their actions having little to do with the outcomes in the story, or if they do, they are merely a puppet whose strings are being pulled by Yarvi or someone else. All of it rending our new characters little more than distractions from the real story playing out behind the scenes, which left me annoyed and longing for a chapter where the old characters (Yarvi, Uthil, et cetera) would be my point of view yet again.My third complaint is the “romantic” element here. I have to admit not being a huge fan of Yarvi’s love story inHalf a King, but I could swallow it. When Thorn and Brand got together in book two, I rolled my eyes more than a bit, but I’m not a young adult anymore so I just threw it up to my romantic side being a bit cynical after a lifetime of real life. But in this story, Skara and her significant other never, never felt the least bit moving or even plausible. It felt forced and contrived; all of it a set up so the author could paint yet another character in absolute shades of grey.But the most disappointing aspect of this novel to me, the most annoying element was the absolute lack of suspense. I’m merely speaking for myself, but the ending, the revelation of people’s true actions, and the transformation of characters into traditional grimdark snakes was guessed well in advance and did not deviate from their estimated course. The lack of “Wow!” reveals causing me to skim pages continually.Now, I know that sounds like I did not enjoyHalf a Warat all, but the fact is it was an okay book, well worth reading to see how Yarvi and the Shattered Sea story ended. What it has cemented in my mind, however, is that – try as I might – I do not enjoy the kind of grimdark Mr. Abercrombie pens. Not sure exactly what it is, but I find his style, his constant philosophical commentary (I grew tired of “Only half a war is fought with swords” appearing so frequently in the narrative.), and his grey characters lacking in some essential quality, making me dread picking up his books rather than anxious to do so. I completely understand why many of you love his works (I can see his stellar writing ability clearly on the pages in front of me.), but I have merely accepted that I’m not going to be on the bandwagon no matter how many of his books I read. Don’t be sad for me though, because there are more than enough books out there for everyone to love.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22381326-half-a-war,Half a War.txt
The Goblin Emperor,"It is said that Samuel Richardson, after being hectored by readers and critics following the runaway success of his novelClarissa(a success, one gathers from reading period chatter, due in large part to his witty villain Lovelace before his inevitable and lugubrious end), promised he would write about agoodman.So he gave the world Sir Charles Grandison, who was so firmly aware enough of his perfection that he converses lengthily to all and sundry between the busyness of kidnappings, abductions, defeating villains, etc. It’s interesting to me when reading reader reactions to these early novels that women seemed to enjoy Sir Charles more than men. Jane Austen, who had a very sharp eye for character in reality as well as in fiction, loved the novel so much she adapted it into a play.I’m going to come back to that as I try to feel my way through my reactions, but first:The Goblin Emperor’s Maia is, from the beginning, to the end, a good person. We the reader can see that—the first sign comes early on when, on being thrust summarily aboard an airship after discovering he is now the emperor of the elves, he takes the time to look into the faces of the crew. But he doesn’t see himself as good. He is aware of his shortcomings, and his inward struggle is as profound as the outward struggle against the many forces arrayed against him.At the start, the unwanted half-goblin fourth son is now emperor.Previous to this, Maia survived ten years of his cousin’s brutal guardianship, and before that, eight years of his gentle, spiritual mother’s loving influence. Maia is utterly unprepared for any life, really: the little he was allowed to learn was beaten into him by Setheris, who made certain Maia had an understanding of the exigencies of law, and of court.Maia’s first piece of luck is the probity of the courier who brought the news, ScevetOne of my few, and mild, quibbles is that I would have liked to see a bit more development here. Scevet is almost too conveniently the dedicated guide, with no apparent life of his own.. Maia relies on Scevet to help him navigate the dangers of a court that actively as well as covertly does not want Maia as emperor.And so he must get himself crowned, get the dead buried, the cause of the accident investigated, and all the while deal with the inexorable press of responsibilities expected of an emperor.KingsI like stories about kings. Kings are, well, kings. Sometimes I get tired of democratic pearl-clutching about adolescent fantasy and its preoccupation with kings. Guess what, there are kings in all forms in all literature. Human beings don’t doanythingwithout their hierarchies. I’m less interested in reading about cubicle bosses or alphas at high school or arrogant pundits on the literary scene than I am in stories in which the trappings are colorful, and grace and style are part of the equation. There’s a better chance of that kind of story with kings.But I lose interest fast if the kings don’t actually do any kinging. The weight of empire, the contradictions (the lack of privacy, and private time), the unending negotiation between balance and inertia, chaos and progress, those are some of the aspects I like about royal stories, and this one has got it right. Even the levels of language are not overlooked, or the several handwritings. These geeky details for the history buff give the world dimension.WorldbuildingThis world is less magical than steam run. There are elves and goblins. The elves are Tolkien-pale, with beautiful hair and light eyes, but these are not Tolkien’s elves. They not only have pointed ears (stepping around the passionate sixties discussions of whether JRRT’s elves actually had pointed ears or not), but they are rather like dog or cat ears: they move, often reflecting emotions as well as responding to directional sound.These elves were not Tolkien’s elves, nor were they the emotionally adolescent prettyboy elves of many eighties fantasies. They aren’t “elfpunk.” There is almost no music in this elfland, no particular emphasis on the natural world: if anything, the elves in their complicated stone edifices hearken back to Tolkien’s dwarves. As far as I could tell there is little euphony in their words or names, long as they are: the long names with their syllabic and prefix patterns instead suggest a long and complicated history. The elves seem to live human spans of life, and of course can breed with other races.Their world evokes the late nineteenth century, undergoing technological and cultural change. Women in all the cultures seem to be bound to childbirth, at least at the upper levels of various societies. Wealth is based on the suffering of the poor working long hours in mines.Maia sees no problem with women realizing their desires outside of cultural mandated babymaker. I think I would have looked askance at that—seen it as preaching to the choir—except that Maia’s own emotional makeup, as powerless victim of abuse, is his motivation for empathetic action and compassion. “We were not seen as worth educating either,” that is perhaps the quintessential comment of the nineteenth century female gaze; it represents anyone marginalized, which was, in the west, basically everyone who wasn’t a white heterosexual landowning male.With reference to what I said above about Sir Charles, I think there could be an interesting wider discussion of male/female narrative gazes spinning off from this book, but I can see that this review is already long, so I think that that discussion will have to take place elsewhere.Suffice it to say that the book begins slowly, as the weight of responsibility threatens to crush Maia, who already knows what it is to be crushed: as he begins to push back, things happen. The gradual acceleration of the pace left me suddenly at the end. The story resolves, but oh, was I disappointed to discover that there isn’t more, just because I want to spend more time in that world, and with those people.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17910048-the-goblin-emperor,The Goblin Emperor.txt
The Shadow of the Torturer,"Wolfe has an almost legendary status amongst fellow authors; Gaiman called him 'a ferocious intellect', Swanwick said he's ""the greatest writer in the English language alive today"", andDischcalled this series ""a tetralogy of couth, intelligence, and suavity"".You can rarely trust the popular market to single out good authors, but you'd think it might be safe to listen to the opinions of other writers (especially an assemblage of Nebula and Hugo winners in their own right). I will give his fans one concession: Wolfe is an author who defies expectations. Unfortunately, I was expecting him to be remarkable and interesting.This book had been sitting on my shelf for months, along with other highly-praised works I've been looking forward to, but I bade my time, waiting for the mood to strike. Few live up to their reputation, but most at least deliver part of the promise.I would expect any author mentioned in the same breath asPeaketo have an original and vibrant style, but I found Wolfe's writing to be simple without being elegant. His language and structure serves its purpose, only occasionally rising above mere utilitarianism, and then he rushes to florid flourishes that fall flat as often as they succeed. Sometimes, it is downright dull. The prose of the second book is stronger than the first, but its plot and characters are more linear and predictable.I appreciated his 'created language' more than most fantasy authors, but I didn't find it particularly mysterious or difficult, because all of his words are based on recognizable Germanic or Romantic roots. Then again, after three years of writing stories about Roman whores in Latin, I had little problem with 'meretriculous'. Even those words I wasn't familiar with seemed clear by their use.The terms are scattered throughout the book, but rarely contribute to a more pervasive linguistic style, as might be seen inThe Worm Ouroboros, The Lord of the Rings, Gormenghast, orThe King of Elfland's Daughter. Wolfe's terms pepper otherwise and unremarkable modern style, which hardly helps to throw us into a strange world.He is better than the average fantasy author, but he resembles them more than he differs from them. His protagonist started off interestingly enough: an apparently weak and intelligent man, which made it all the more disappointing when he suddenly transformed into a laconic, wench-loving buttkicker who masters sword-fighting, finds the Super Magic Thing and follows the path of his Awesome Foretold Fate. Again, I must agree withNick Lowe: Wolfe's plot owes more to magic and convenience than good storytelling.It relies on the same tricks over and over: any time a character is about to give important information to us, there will be a sudden attack or other interruption, as convenient and annoying as the moment when the dying man says ""I was killed by . . . aargh"". We also get problems solved by divine intervention whenever things start to slow, which doesn't leave the characters much room to be active.He also seems to suffer from the same sexual discomfort that plagues so many fantasy authors. There is an undercurrent of obsession with women and their sexuality, complete with the sexualization of rape and murder. It's not so much a case of misogyny as it is an inequality in how characters behave.The women always seem to end up as playtoys for the narrator, running around naked, desiring him, sparring with him coyly, but ultimately, conquered; and the camera pans away. They always approach him, desire him, pretending they don't want him, then give themselves up to him. It's the same old story of an awkward, emotionless male protagonist who is inexplicably followed and harangued by women who fall in love with him for no given reason, familiar to anyone who's seen a harem anime.I will grant that the women have more character than the average fantasy heroine, but it still doesn't leave them with much. Instead of giving into love at first sight, they fight it as long as they can, making it that much sweeter when the narrator finally 'wins'. The sexuality was not new, interesting, arousing, or mutual, it was merely the old game of 'overcoming the strong woman' that is familiar to readers of theGor books.The sense of 'love' in The New Sun is even more unsettling. It descends on the characters suddenly and nonsensically, springing to life without build or motivation. The word never comes up in connection with any psychological development, nor does it ever seem to match the relationships as they are depicted. More often than not, it seems love is only mentioned so the narrator can coldly break his lover's trust in the next chapter.Several times, the narrator tries to excuse himself for objectifying women by mentioning that he also objectifies ugly women. What this convolution of misogyny is supposed to represent, I couldn't say. The narrator seems very interested in this fact, and is convinced that it makes him a unique person. It made it very clear to me why the most interesting antiheroes tend to be gruff and laconic, because listening to a chauvinistic sociopath talk about himself is insufferable.Then there is the fact that every character you meet in the story turns up again, hundreds of miles away, to reveal that they are someone else and have been secretly controlling the action of the plot. It feels like the entire world is populated by about fifteen people who follow the narrator around wherever he goes. If the next two books continue along the same lines, then the big reveal will be that the world is entirely populated by no more than three superpowered shapeshifters.Everyone in the book has secret identities, secret connections to grand conspiracies, and important plot elements that they conveniently hide until the last minute, only doling out clues here and there. There are no normal people in this world, only double agents and kings in disguise. Every analysis I've read of this book mentions that even the narrator is unreliable.This can be an effective technique, but in combination with a world of infinite, unpredictable intrigue, Wolfe's story begins to evoke something between a soap opera and a convoluted mystery novel, relying on impossible and contradictory scenarios to mislead the audience. Apparently, this is the thing his fans most appreciate about him--I find it to be an insulting and artificial game.I agree withthis reviewerthat there is simply not enough structure to the story to make the narrator's unreliability meaningful. In order for unreliable narration to be effective, there must be some clear and evident counter-story that undermines it. Without that, it is not possible to determine meaning, because there's nowhere to start: everything is equally shaky.At that point, it's just a trick--adding complexity to the surface of the story without actually producing any new meaning. I know most sci fi and fantasy authors seem to love complexity for its own sake, but it's a cardinal sin of storytelling: don't add something into your story unless it needs to be there. Covering the story with a lot of vagaries and noise may impress some, but won't stand up to careful reading.Fantasy novels are often centered on masculinity, violence, and power struggles, and so by making the narrator an emotionally distant manipulator with sociopathic tendencies, Wolfe's story is certainly going to resemble other genre outings. If Severian is meant to be a subversion of the grim antihero, I would expect a lot of clever contradiction which revealed him. His unreliability would have to leave gaping holes that point to another, more likely conclusion. If the protagonist's mendacious chauvinism is not soundly contradicted, then there is really nothing separating him from what he is supposed to be mocking.Poe's Lawstates that it can be difficult to tell whether something is an act of mockery or an example of genuine extremism, and perhaps that's what's going on here: Wolfe's mockery is so on-the-nose that it is indistinguishable from other cliche genre fantasy. But even if that were true, then the only thing separating Wolfe from the average author is the fact that he's doing it on purpose, which is hardly much of a distinction. If a guy punches himself in the nose and then insists ""I meant to do that"", I don't think that makes him any less of a dumbass.Human psychology and politics are fraught enough without deliberately obfuscating them. Unfortunately, Wolfe does not have the mastery of psychology to make a realistically complicated text, only a cliched text that is meta-complicated.After finishing the book, I tried to figure out why it had garnered so much praise. I stumbled across a number of articles, includingthis oneby Gaiman andthis oneby an author who wrote a book of literary analysis about the New Sun series.Both stressed that Wolfe was playing a deliberate meta-fictional game with his readers, creating mysteries and clues in his book for them to follow, so that they must reread the text over and over to try to discern what is actually happening. I won't claim this isn't a technical feat, but I would suggest that if Wolfe wanted us to read his book over and over, he might have written it with verve, style, character, and originality. As the above critic says:""On a first, superficial reading, there is little to distinguish Wolfe’s tetralogy from many other sf and fantasy novels . . . The plot itself is apparently unremarkable.""Perhaps I'm alone in this, but I have no interest in reading your average sword-wielding badass gender-challenged fantasy book over and over in the hopes that it will get better. If Wolfe is capable of writing an original and interesting story, why cover it with a dull and occasionally insulting one?I have enjoyed complex books before, books with hidden messages and allusions, but they were interesting both in their depths and on the surface. I didn't find the New Sun books particularly complex or difficult. His followers have said that he isn't 'concerned with being conspicuously witty', but I'd suggest he's merely incapable of being vibrant or intriguing.There were interesting ideas and moments in the book, and I did appreciate what originality Wolfe did have, but I found it strange that such a different mind would produce such hidebound prose, tired descriptions, convenient plots, and unappealing characters. It has usually been my experience that someone who is capable of thinking remarkable things is capable of writing remarkable things.Sure, there were some interesting Vancian moments, where you realize that some apparently magical effect is actual a piece of sci fi detritus: this character is a robot, that tower is actually a rocket, a painting of a mythical figure clearly depicts an astronaut--but this doesn't actually add anything to the story, they weren't important facts, they were just details thrown in.It didn't matter that any of those things were revealed to be something else than they appeared, because it didn't change anything about the story, or the characters, or the themes or ideas. These weren't vital and strange ideas to be explored, like the mix of sci fi and fantasy inVance,Le Guin, or M. John Harrison, but inconsequential 'easter eggs' for obsessing fans to dig up.AsClarke's Third Lawsays: any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Therefore, switching back and forth between magical explanations and super-technological ones doesn't mean much, on its own. They're indistinguishable. Star Wars may use the trappings of sci fi, but it's just a fantasy story about wizards and knights in space. In order to make the distinction meaningful, you've got to put some kind of spin on it.Overall, I found nothing unique in Wolfe. Perhaps it's because I've read quite a bit of odd fantasy; if all I read was mainstream stuff, then I'd surely find Wolfe unpredictable, since he is a step above them. But compared to Leiber, Howard, Dunsany, Eddison, Kipling, Haggard, Peake, Mieville, or Moorcock, Wolfe is nothing special.Perhaps I just got my hopes up too high. I imagined something that might evoke Peake or Leiber (at his best), perhaps with a complexity and depth gesturing toward Milton or Ariosto. I could hardly imagine a better book than that, but even a book half that good would be a delight--or a book that was nothing like that, but was unpredictable and seductive in some other way.I kept waiting for something to happen, but it never really did. It all plods along without much rise or fall, just the constant moving action to make us think something interesting is happening. I did find some promise, some moments that I would have loved to see the author explore, particularly those odd moments where Silver Age Sci Fi crept in, but each time he touched upon these, he would return immediately to the smallness of his plot and his annoying prick of a narrator. I never found the book to be difficult or complex, merely tiring. the unusual parts were evasive and vague, and the dull parts constant and repetitive.The whole structure (or lack of it) does leave things up to interpretation, and perhaps that's what some readers find appealing: that they can superimpose their own thoughts and values onto the narrator, and onto the plot itself. But at that point, they don't like the book Wolfe wrote, they like the book they are writing between his lines.I'll lend the book out to some fantasy-loving friends and they'll buy the next one, which I'll then have to borrow from them so I can see if there's ever a real payoff. Then again, if Sevarian's adolescent sexuality is any evidence, the climax will be as underwhelming as the self-assured, fumbling foreplay. If I don't learn to stop giving my heart away, it's just going to get broken again.Ah well, once more unto the breach.My Fantasy Book Suggestions",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60211.The_Shadow_of_the_Torturer,The Shadow of the Torturer.txt
The Shadow of What Was Lost,"A new Fantasy series that is being compared to the venerated, though highly divisive,Wheel Of Timeseries? What what! Sign me up please! I actually hadn't even heard aboutThe Shadow Of What Was Lostuntil I saw it popping up on various feeds and getting pretty decent reviews here on Goodreads, and since my local book club was due for a Fantasy read, I made sure that this was the one we selected. We normally have a 2 week read cycle, but because this was over 700 pages, we decided to give ourselves a month of reading time before we discussed it.I finished it in less than a week...So yeah, I obviously enjoyed it. It's hard for me to really find time for a good solid read anymore, especially one as dense as this. And even having it on an e-reader still doesn't guarantee that I'll have enough time to truly ""burn"" through a book like I used to when I was younger. But somehow this one kept me firmly engaged, and I managed to find plenty of reading time. After trying my best to read outside of my traditional comfort zones for the first half of the year, it was nice to get back to a good, solid Fantasy tale. And what a tale this is! But, I guess the real question is: does the first entry in the Licanius Trilogy stand on the same pedestal as the peers it is being compared to, namely epics by Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson?My personal answer to that is no, not quite. It does, however, come very close. And as a debut novel it is pretty damn solid, and very well thought out. But I can't in good conscience say that it is ""my new favorite Fantasy series"" as is being touted by other outlets. To be fair, folks who enjoyed WoT or Sanderson's various Fantasy series absolutely will find much to love withThe Shadow Of What Was Lost. There's familiarity here, like slipping into well-worn slippers or a comfy t-shirt (which works both for AND against the story). The framework is such that you have a basic understanding of the whole, even if the rather numerous moving parts are slightly different than what you're used to.As befitting of a series with this much going on,The Shadow Of What Was Lostis a third person tale told from numerous viewpoints. This helps to provide a larger sense of scale, as the protagonists of the tale are generally not always in the same place, so we get to see events play out on a grand stage. And like I said before, much of it is familiar. We have the plucky, reluctant hero who has a power he shouldn't, his best friend who is harboring a rather large secret, a friend/love interest who has a much larger role to play than initially suspected, and an amnesiac cipher with his own strange abilities. That said, the characters themselves are interesting enough, and richly drawn enough, that they manage to remain compelling, and while the archetypes themselves aren't anything new, the way they are integrated into the tale keeps them unique. Well, almost...Ostensibly the ""main"" character, Davian is perhaps the one that suffers most from Fantasy deja-vu. We've seen this ""chosen one"" character before, and as such, of the four primary POV characters, he is probably the most familiar, which does tend to make his chapters less exciting. I liked him well enough, as he has some truly enjoyable ""I can do what?!"" moments as he discovers more about his abilities, and he had some genuine ""grey area"" moments that made him more than just a heroic ""do gooder"". While his heart is in the right place, I definitely sense that he's going to have some moments of conflict in the next two books. Still, he's a worthy and stalwart friend, and is a great surrogate for us readers as we, through him, learn more about the world he inhabits.Wirr, as the best friend, was actually more engaging for me. I liked his twist in the tale, and he was more of a realist than Davian. There is much ""real world"" weight on Wirr's shoulders, which ultimately made him more relatable. But for all the responsibility he was born into, he still has a roguish side that shines through sometimes. If Davian is the Rand of this tale, then Wirr would be Mat. My favorite part about Wirr though, and by extension Davian, is that their friendship never really wavered. Davian is struggling to understand the implications of all that is happening around him and his friends, while Wirr just wants to the right thing, even if that's not necessarily the most popular thing. But even if they have differing opinions, their friendship is always solid and dependable. Their early adventures are some of the most enjoyable passages of the whole book, and really helps cement their relationship.Caeden, as the amnesiac, is really best left alone for fear of spoilers. He had the least amount of page time of the main POC's, but certainly had as large a part to play as Davian. To be honest, I wasn't terribly invested in his struggle to regain his memories, as he was such a cipher that he wasn't terribly engaging. He has a few cool moments, but those get overshadowed by a lot of pages of ""not knowing who I am or what I stand for"" blandness. In fact, I had kinda written him off, but there's some shenanigans that happen near the end of the book that really impact his character, and his part to play in the ongoing drama. Nuff said there.By far my favorite character, and the one that also frustrated me due to lack of answers, was friend/love interest Asha. I think she's introduced in a way that tricks the reader into thinking they know how her character arc will go. And that was probably done deliberately. Because her part isn't something you see coming, which ultimately makes it that much more enjoyable. While Davian, Wirr, and Caeden have their moments of character growth and introspection, Asha truly has a definitive ""arc"" in this story, and is no longer the same person she was at the beginning of the tale. It's a believable progression, and makes her that much more compelling. However, there is a mystery around her character that doesn't get answered in this first book (that I noticed anyways) which was rather frustrating. In addition to a GREAT scene near the end of the book, Asha also gets some cool companions of her own to interact with that give the story that much more depth.Aside from the many POV characters, we get quite a supporting cast, which is where things get really interesting. Nearly half of the named people that our protagonists meet in this first book have their own agenda or role to play in the growing conflict, and their motivations aren't always clear. This is a source of some of the book's best drama, but also a lot of its frustrations as well. Since nearly everyone has their own secret motivations, and since those motivations don't always align with those of our heroes (or even the villains necessarily), it can get kind of confusing following all the move/counter-move subterfuge going on. Like one of the characters said in the recent Free Fire movie, ""I forgot which side I'm on!"". I felt that way several times throughout the book, as there was so much name dropping that I truly forgot who was who at times, including what side they were on (if they were even on an established side). Part of that might be debut novel inexperience, but I think an equal part of that is that there's just so many characters, and not necessarily enough time spent with them to help them stand out. But they are characters that you want to revisit, which keeps the enjoyment factor high.Another point of frustration is that we get a few side characters who get rather limited page time, but are more interesting than other characters who are around more. If these characters don't make appearances in the next two books, I'm going to be severely disappointed. Especially when it comes to Breshada and her named sword Whisper. You DON'T introduce a character like that, make her so badass and whatnot, only to have her never make a return. Come on Islington, I'm counting on you here...On the villain side, we have a range to choose from. There's the ultimate big bad, locked away in his sealed pris...errrr...behind a magical barrier. But the barrier is weakening, meaning his presence is seeping through, which does not bode well for our heroes. We also get varied villainy being performed by different factions that our protagonists face off against. Some of it is effective, some of it induces head scratching. And some were just plain ""oh, ok, guess he's a bad guy too!"" inclusions that came out of left field. If nothing else, our heroes certainly have to work for every little triumph, which does lend a sense of urgency and danger. Thankfully, the motivations of the villains are generally clearly defined and make sense, so we do get a good sense of why they are behaving as they are.So outside of characters, how does the book hold up? Honestly, mostly pretty well. The factions, politics, and religions of the world are generally detailed enough to make sense, though I never truly had enough detail to connect all the dots. I'm assuming more will be revealed in the next books, which is fine. I don't need EVERYTHING explained all at once. That said, it was hard for me to really get an idea of where things were in relation to each other. So yeah, a certain sense of scale is lacking. In WoT, Jordan made you feel the great distances involved, where here it's kind of nebulous. At least the reasoning behind the Gifted (aka Essence users) being persecuted is well explained. Still, using a device of great magic to subdue the magic users of the world seems...kinda silly. And kinda lazy.As for said magic, aka Essence, there's some nifty things that can be done with it, but I don't think the potential has really been tapped yet. The way it works is slightly vague, so I'm not entirely sure what can, and cannot, be done still. And there's another power outside of Essence that has even more potential. We do get some of that explained as well, but again, this book only scratches the surface. I have my suspicions that both of these will get more time to shine in the sequels. I truly hope so anyways. A good magic system can really help enhance a Fantasy novel, so here's to hoping that Essence and Kan (Khaaaaaaaaaaaaan!!!!!) get their due in books two and three.There were also a couple of inconsistencies that I hope get addressed going forward. There's some time travel elements in the book that seem to contradict themselves throughout the story, and I have a hard time with that. I'm assuming these will be cleared up as we progress...Sadly, for everything the book does right, it does an equal amount of things in a fashion that we are already used to. A mentor figure traveling with the heroes, with his/her own agenda, who knows more about the main character than said main character does about himself? Check. Evil quasi-sentient city that the heroes have no choice but to trek through, that ends up having a lasting impact on the story? Check. The majority of the fate changing/world altering heroes coming from the same location (school here, village in WoT)? Yep, you guessed it...check. So if you are looking for familiarity, you've come to the right book. And while familiarity can be a good thing, it also hindered this book a bit for me, as I had too many moments of ""been there, done that"". With any epic fantasy tale, there's going to be similarities, and I totally get that. However, I guess they were just TOO similar here for my liking.But it must be said that, quibbles aside, this is a very enjoyable read. And familiarity or no, to Mr. Islington's credit, there were a few minor twists and one MAJOR shocker near the end of the book that I certainly did not see coming. So kudos to him for taking the story in some truly unique directions as the book came to a close. While some of the initial mysteries were answered here, the book does a great job of establishing struggles and questions that need resolution in the sequel, while really setting the stage for the larger conflict that will connect all three books. I firmly expect book two to have a tighter narrative and a more focused progression, now that the exposition and stage setting has been accomplished. And now that he has some experience, I am sure that Mr. Islington will only grow as an author and storyteller. Was it perfect? No, but it was damn good. I will certainly be reading the sequel,An Echo Of Things To Come, when it comes out!",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22878967-the-shadow-of-what-was-lost,The Shadow of What Was Lost.txt
The Bone Witch,"This freaking book.Just to get this out of the way, this was not a good book. As many reviewers at Booklikes noted, this YA fantasy novel hit every trope that many of us readers are tired of reading.Main character is the best (insert name of thing) ever.There is purple prose galore.World-building is all over the place and more often than not, author contradicts themselves regarding the rules they have put in place.There is a love triangle (STOP IT!)People (usually women) are jealous of main character for reasons unknown. That don't make sense to you as a reader, but at that point you just go with it since you want it to end.Development of characters seems to be an afterthought.Book ends on freaking cliffhanger so you know as a reader that the author/publisher is going to stretch this thing out to at least 3 books. Looking at you ""Dorothy Must Die"" series which managed to push out 4 books.I really loved the cover for ""The Bone Witch"" and when I read the synopsis a few months ago I thought this book would be right up my alley. I was wrong.Told in alternating points of view, ""The Bone Witch"" has a character who is a bard (no, not looking up his name) who comes across Tea, who is a dark asha (think witch, it's easier) also called bone witches.This bard has come from (don't recall kingdom) in order to find Tea.Tea agrees to tell her life story after the bard witnesses her slaying a daeva in order to get its bezoar. Just think of a daeva as an undead thing that looks like a dragon. I don't know. The bezoar is a jeweled remnant left behind that a dark asha like Tea can use in her spells. Seriously, after that the book just jumps into a free for all regarding this world that we find ourselves reading about.When the POV switches to Tea, we find out what incident occurred in order for Tea to be declared a dark asha. We get to read about how she raised her dead brother (Fox) from the grave. And this is what kills me. The book has promise when you read about that. You are instantly fascinated. Then you are drowned in minutiae and you just don't care anymore.The book goes back and forth between the bard's POV and Tea's. I really wish that Chupeco had not decided to tell the bard's POV in italic. I know that they want to visually show the different points of view. But it was hard to read. I don't think people realize that when you have an e-reader or heck even a hardcover or paperback having someone's eyes having to constantly adjust to different fonts can cause a headache. I know I had one yesterday.Tea was not exciting at all. If you want to read about her crush on Prince Kance enjoy that. Also read about how angry she is at having to deal with chores and the food she eats. For pages and pages. I am not kidding about this. A good 3/4 of this book was just descriptions of what she was wearing, what was in her hair (jeweled things that somehow give ashas power), how she felt when Prince Kance was near her, what she was eating, how she sang, danced, and fought. This book borrowed heavily from ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" to the point that a few times I felt like I was experiencing deja-vu because a scene would sounds so similar to one from that book.There were a few things in here that I think that Chupeco wanted to include for a very special after school moment, but it fell flat to me. She includes a character (named Likh) that wants to be an asha (he has a silver heart) but in this world, since he is a male, he has to be a deathseeker. Likh doesn't want to be one, and Tea and her dead brother Fox try their best to be behind his efforts to become an asha. At one point he makes a speech that he doesn't seem himself as a boy, that since he was a boy he liked girl things (dolls and dresses) and I just cringed inside.I think Chupeco is trying to portray him as gay. But that does not equal only liking girl things and not liking swords or rough play. Heck I was a tomboy and fought my mother tooth and nail to not be in a dress outside of church (boy did she despair) and yet I was not gay. I just think she should be careful with generalizations like this when writing.We have other characters like Lady Mykaela, Lady Zoya, Mother Parmina and others who I wish we had been able to visit with more. They had more going on then Tea that was for sure. But honestly after a while, it was hard to keep track of so many people. Every few pages it felt like someone new was being included in this book.The writing was purple prose run amok.And honestly what really kills me about this book is that I still don't get the world building that Chupeco has in this book. We have ashas who can control fire, water, wind, and earth (I think). And then we have dark ashas who can control the dead. How the heck does that even link up to the other four elements? Even Captain Planet decided to go with ""heart"" for crying out loud as a fifth element.Don't get me started why ashas who can control the elements are even being taught about dancing, flower arrangement, how to sing, how to perform, etc. Chupeco even has the ashas going to tea houses to have conversations with men. Once again there is a whole what in the world thought running through my mind. When Chupeco goes into Tea having to work off her debt to the ""Mother"" of her house I just started to laugh. This fantasy world is definitely not for me.Chupeco tries to describe the runes that Tea is learning about, but man oh man my eyes just glazed over. We really only get two fight scenes in this book, and those were the only interesting parts of this book. Everything else was a big meh to me.Chupeco has ""The World of the Bone Witch"" section that she included at the end of the book. It would have been better to put that up front after she showcased the maps of this world. I also really wish that Chupeco had thought to include a dictionary for the terms in this book. You have to guess a lot at what certain words mean or what she means when talking about somethings. For example, the clothes that the ashas wear are referred to as huas. Guess what I could not find that word anywhere in the dictionary. I ended up having to Google and found out that hua means China. I don't know if that is true or not since it popped up via Wikipedia. I imagine that Chupeco means that this outfits (based on the endless pages of descriptions) are similar somewhat to kimonos though. Same thing when I tried to look up daesha which turned up some interesting results.The setting of this world that Chupeco creates at first glance sounds interesting. Everyone has an actual physical representation of their heart that they wear for all to see in a heartglass. People (ashas mostly) can see the colors in the heartglass and can tell if you are happy, anxious, sad, sick, etc. But if you give your heart away (cue danger) you can slowly start to die. But sometimes not. And sometimes you can get a new heart. I am sure this is all going to reveal about love or something in book #2 or #3.Chupeco also shows the kingdom includes people with blonde hair and blue eyes, dark haired people with dark eyes, and golden skinned people with I can't even remember what eyes they had, I think she refers to their shape. But then people pop up who are dark skinned and I just didn't have the energy to figure out what kingdom they even come from.The ending was a freaking cliffhanger. There are enough clues here and there that you can imagine what happened to put Tea on this path, which is why having a cliffhanger really doesn't work. There was one reveal that I think will surprise some readers if they manage to finish this book. I know that I don't really care what caused Tea to take the measures that she is about to do.I read this for booklikes-oply. The Kindle Edition is 432 pages.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30095464-the-bone-witch,The Bone Witch.txt
King of Thorns,"Originally reviewed atBookwraiths Reviews__________________________________________2015 UPDATE AFTER FINISHING THE TRILOGYIn the below review, I had many criticisms about the story, specifically how Jorg seemingly produced ""super-powers"" out of thin air to save himself. While that is exactly how I felt after closingKing,Emperor of Thornssatisfactorily explained those aspects of the story, so when reading this review, please understand many of my criticisms were later made moot by Mr. Lawrence.__________________________________________THE SOCIOPATH IS AT IT AGAIN!While I despised Jorg inPrince of Thorns, the story itself was highly entertaining and kept me turning pages as quickly as I could read them. However, I did not find this novel as engrossing, perhaps because I’ve grown somewhat use to the main character’s sociopathic behavior.In any event, since the “shock” value of Jorg didn’t overwhelm me this go round, I found myself focusing a great deal on the story itself, which quite honestly was a bit underwhelming. I could write a multi page review about everything I disliked about this book, but in short, the storytelling was lacking, the character growth was non-existent, the plot had glaring holes, and Mr. Lawrence continued his trend of what I like to call: the superpower of the day solution to problems.Please allow me to explain.In the first book and now the second, Mr. Lawrence writes our favorite sociopath into situations where no reasonable person can expect success. Things look really grim for Jorg many times. However, whenever he needs it, Jorg miraculously discovers some new superpower (magic, science, math, or whatever) to save his ass. To be specific, inPrince of Thorns, Jorg was given necromancer power that kept him alive when a normal man would have died. InKing of Thorns, Jorg gets new, updated necromancer powers, fire-magic skill and Builder tools exactly when he needs them to SAVE HIS ASS YET AGAIN!Of course, the negative issues with those powers – as shown clearly by their affect on other characters in the novels – miraculously leave Jorg unaffected. And don’t even bother to ask how he actually gets a thousand year old Builder’s tool in book two, or how a thousand year old tool would still even work. Who knows, because Mr. Lawrence never tells the reader either of those things. Just poof, Jorg has this thousand year old tool, and it works and SAVES HIS ASS AGAIN!Damn, it is good to be Superman in a Superman comic, isn’t it?But I digress.Like I stated earlier, I felt this story had glaring holes in the plot. They ranged from unexplained entities controlling everyone to Jorg traveling to seek a fire-mage for no apparent reason to the sheer unbelievability of the battle for Renar and finally the impossible ending. Honestly, I cannot thing of a single thing in the novel which did not just leap out at me as unbelievable and obviously yet another way for Jorg to be provided with a new “superpower.”Now, Mr. Lawrence attempted to minimize these problems, glossed over them as much as possible, and his usual method appeared to be mayhem or gore whenever the story was not really working. However, this time around all the blood and brains Mr. Lawrence splatters across your reading eyes doesn’t conceal that this story is not making any sense at this point. Because, unfortunately, too much ofKing of Thornsis isolated incidents of horrendous gore or ghostly undead or sociopathic musings without any of it coalescing into a coherent story.Another major issue in this novel was the format, specifically the flashback chapters. I loved the whole flashback concept inPrince of Thorns, as I experienced Jorg’s sociopathic behavior played out in present day yet was able to slowly understand how he reached this depraved state when younger, but the “Four Years Earlier” chapters in this book did not work at all. Indeed, the flashbacks inKing of Thornsmerely interrupted the flow of the story when there was no need to do so, because – other than the one detail contained in the box about Jorq’s new, baby brother (which honestly didn’t amount to much) – nothing in the back story would have prohibited Mr. Lawrence from beginning at the end ofPrince of Thornsand detailing this next four years of Jorg’s life in a linear fashion.And before anyone mentions it, I do not want to hear about Sageous, because he is only trotted out a couple times in the book and is basically a non-entity – except when Mr. Lawrence wants to somehow blame him for every horrendous thing Jorg has ever done in his life. This one, minor character is not a reason for a flashback story.As for the Katherine diary chapters, they can be summed up as boring and not relevant to Jorg’s tale at all. Sorry, they did do one thing: give Jorg unexpected help of exactly the right sort at exactly the right time to SAVE HIS SOCIOPATHIC ASS YET AGAIN!Did I mention it is good to be Superman in a Superman comic?Oh, I did, didn’t I. Sorry.I realize most fantasy fans absolutely adore this book. It is hailed as the best thing since sliced bread or the internet or whatever. But, honestly, just like the Emperor didn’t have on any clothes,King of Thornsis just an okay novel. Sure, it is entertaining, but it really isn’t more than that.I suppose if you idolize Jorg, it’s great fun to see him overcome impossible odds to gain his desired goal. (Of course, you have to overlook the superpower of the day problem, but fanboys don’t really care about that anyway.) But even in fanboy land, it is obvious that this novel does not rise to the shocking brilliance ofPrince of Thorns, which – even with its obvious weaknesses – grabbed hold of your throat on the first page and pulled you through its gore coated world whether you wished to follow or not.And, you know, maybe it was wrong of me to expect Mr. Lawrence to write that sort of book again, because there is only so much raping/killing and other sociopathic behavior one can throw at a reader before he or she grows numb to it. Though the sadistic torture of the innocent dog in this novel was a great try.However, what I had truly hoped for inKing of Thornswas some growth in Jorg’s character, and for a while there, I truly believed Mr. Lawrence was providing us that. The encounter with the ghosts of Gelleth and the trip to find his mother’s family along the Horse Coast – while out of character for the Jorg portrayed in book one – seemed to hold out the promise of a maturing sociopath. But alas, I was mistaken, because by the end we discover that Jorg’s touch of humanity was all an illusion caused by a “magic” box, and now we are back to the same Superman Jorg who knows all, has all the luck, and has all the powers at just the right time with the same old, sociopathic outlook on everything. Zero growth. Same old same old.And that stupendous post-apocalyptic setting that Mr. Lawrence teased us with in the first book. Great idea. Very intriguing. Not developed at all in this novel. There is a short bit about a holographic projection of a long dead “Builder,” but even that doesn’t really add anything except a vague explanation of where magic came from. In fact, the main role of this mysterious “Builder” hologram in the story is to give Mr. Lawrence an excuse as to how Jorg finds two Builder toys to (drumroll please) SAVE HIS ASS YET AGAIN!Quite frankly, this great post-apocalyptic setting is going to waste, used more as a grab bag for weapons for Jorg than anything else. And since we are talking about this, why don’t we the reader know anything about the history of this place?This series is called “The Broken Empire,” right?Jorg Ancrath is trying to reunite it as emperor?Wouldn’t it be useful for a reader to actually know what Empire we are talking about, or maybe why it split apart? Perhaps some history about the last thousand years of human existence since the big apocalypse. I mean, we get lots of talk about ancient Greek legends or ancient philosophy but nothing about this world’s history at all.Are there no legends or stories about the last thousand years?Guess none of that is as important as watching a sociopath murder or maim someone else.I realize that as I published this criticism of the beloved sociopath Jorg that I will have offended the pride many of you have in this character. I’ll most likely get so much negative feedback that I could drown in it all and that my pride might suffer immensely.A time of negative comments might come. Bad times for me. The fanboy universe opens up and all the haters come out to get me. But the world holds worse things than pissed off fans, because I’m a hater too. So, the time of haters can come.It will be my time.If it – and my dislike of Jorg – offends you.STOP ME!Damn, I do love me some Jorg quotes though. :P",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12891107-king-of-thorns,King of Thorns.txt
The Fifth Season,"Re-Read 1/18/24:I finally convinced my buddy reader to read this trilogy, and while she's not an uber-fan like I am, I appreciate her willingness to try.As for me, I'm all for a bit of old anger and seismic activity. Father Earth is angry, after all, and people are shit. I guess things never really change.I'm enjoying the slow reveals and journeys all over again. I'll move on to book two shortly.Old Review:Edit, 10:52 pm, tonight. :) N.K. Jemisin is the WINNER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :) :) :) :) Was there any doubt?Old Review (from a few hours ago):Re-Read 8/20/16, the day the Hugo Awards Ceremony is to take place for the novel I voted for. :) Coincidentally, I'll be reading the sequel tomorrow. :)So was it as good as I remember? Actually, better. But that's mostly because I'm in on the trick and the secret of the MC is is laid bare and the whole novel then becomes a character exploration for me as well as a jaw-dropping mountain-load of quakeworthy World Building and awesome implications.Since I first read this, I read her trilogy and loved it, but what can I say? I still loved this one even more. It speaks to me right down to the absolutely horrible revelations, the personal impacts, the hopes, the fears, the successes... oh, especially the successes... and of course, the question of WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON. :)To say this book is full of questions is to say that a Jane Austen book is full of lace. It's kind of obvious. The question is: What the hell is the lace up to?Jemisin is fantastic for mythology and mythology building, but what is best about this book is the sense of long history and cycles and the deep feeling like it is all headed somewhere huge. And it is. Just let me ask you... What DID happen to the moon? ;)If you haven't read this yet, then you're a fool. :) It's deeply textured in all ways, and its not just the fact that the gods are chained or that we killed Father Earth's only child. It's pretty obvious that this is a deep time future Earth, too, and everything seems to seriously point toward a mind-blowing explanation beyond recurring extinction events. :) Which happen anyway, so yeah, let's get down to the real reasons, shall we?WHY. :) Oh so yummy. :)Looking forward to the awards ceremony tonight. Let's see if my top choice made it! :)Original Review:This is my first N. K. Jemisin, and I'm truly ashamed that I hadn't gotten around to her writing before now. I'm just putting that out right away, because this shame is all my own, and it is deep.Secondly, this feels like an intensely personal novel, to me, and for me, although maybe nobody will ever know why, except me. The way she treats the volcanoes and the earthquakes make me seethe with jealousy and rage, because it is just so damn good.And thirdly, I'm stuck straddling the line between how much I enjoyed the POV developments and how they eventually revealed something truly great by the end and how much I wish I had known the secret from the very start. It wouldn't have taken much. Just another line following each heading. There would have been no confusion, no mystery. But no, it is as it is, and I'm very likely going to have to reread the novel to pick up any possible failings of my inconsiderate attention span before I dive into the second novel that follows this.So what am I trying to say, here? That I'm a miserable failure who is taking this novel way too seriously and admits that he may have missed too much on the first read because the novel was too dense for his little brain? Possibly.But what I'm really saying is that this novel has skyrocketed to one of the topmost favorite novels that I've ever read, that I'm squeeing about it, and that I think I've just found my newest favorite author of all time.I like to think that I'm fairly well read. I like to think I have a fairly discriminate palate that shows in my reviews, even if they don't always show in something as simple as a star on a bar. I like to think that I can pick out works of deeply fine quality and works that have obviously been borne quite bloodily from an author's head, like Athena, only with much more gore. This is one of those damn fine novels that just REEKS of imagination, forethought, CRAFT, and one hell of a fine setup, a fine conclusion, and finally, a fantastic and sharp new setup.I remember the moon. I thought of it throughout this novel. Its having been missing throughout all these damn cataclysms caused me as much grief as the idea that the Fifth Seasons are actually huge diebacks on the Earth, recurring endlessly ever since we killed the moon in some mysterious and immense SF past. We have people with amazing powers, almost godlike in scope, having undergone so much social and historical upheavals, themselves, that no one even knows their history any longer, or why they chose to chain themselves.We have our main character and her shadow,seen semi-confusedly through different names and time periods, from childhood to adulthood to middle age; the last being the present, shown to us through the POV of her shadow in second-person.developing to a final convergence that is a truly wonderful reveal, while leaving us with even greater questions and a truly immense possible conflict. As if supervolcanoes and earthquakes and their control or release weren't enough conflict, right? We've the makings of one of the biggest revenge stories I've ever had the pleasure to read.It's almost as if I'm reading a quality SF novel that has been allowed the freedom to go Super Sayan on me.And so my jaw drops.Am I utterly amazed after reading this? Yes. Hell yes.Do I have any reservations with the author's writing, timing, storytelling, subject, characters, or reveals? No. Hell no.I do want so say one thing after reading the afterward, though. Thank you, Ms. Jemisin for not giving up on this amazing novel. All of your blood, sweat, and tears have brought forth something truly great. I am indebted to you, personally, for changing my life and my expectations about what can actually be pulled forth from a great novel. You did something Big. Thank you!Update 4/27/16And so now we learn that this novel has been nominated for both the 2016 Hugo and the Nebula!By my review above, I'm pretty certain I've expressed how much I love this book, and that has not changed one bit. If I was in a position to scream from my soapbox to say to the Nebulas that this is the clear winner, I would. As it *is*, I CAN scream from my soapbox to the Hugos and say it. :)I mentioned in my review forThe Aeronaut's Windlass, another book that also got the Hugo nomination for this year, that there really should be two separate categories for Standalone Novels and another for Novels in a Series, because most series novels have the luxury of taking things extremely slow and build character, setting, and plot in such long sweeping epics that when we look back on them, they fairly overwhelm us if they've done their job right.Standalone novels can do the same thing, of course, but they have to do so economically and usually with a great deal of panache and brilliance and editing that probably makes it an entirely different kind of beast from the series novels. At this point in the SF/F genres, we have amazing examples of both and we're getting crowded in one single category that more often than not has to artificially balance series novels 3 out of 5 in 2016, crowding out a plethora of brilliant standalone novels.I'm fairly naturally prejudiced to separate these two forms in my head, because I'm totally invested in the characters and settings in the series, while I'm learning everything new for the first time in the standalone.When I think of the Hugos, I generally think of standalone novels, but I *know* it isn't true. I've recently finished reading all the Hugo winners and a very significant portion of the nominations all the way back to the start of the award. Still, I feel a bit prejudiced. I want excellent standalone novels to be recognized as such, uncontaminated by preconceptions.BUT. I also have to make a decision based on just how F***ing Awesome a book is, too, andThe Fifth Season, even if it is the first in a new series, is F***ing Awesome.I'm sure a lot of people felt the same way aboutAncillary Justicewhen it came out, and I can't say that was the wrong choice for that year, either. :) Good is Good is Good is Good.So regardless of whether the category should be split up or not, out of all the choices we're presented, I thinkThe Fifth Seasonshould shake the whole ceremony up. :)",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19161852-the-fifth-season,The Fifth Season.txt
Mistborn: The Final Empire,"I have a Booktube channel now! Subscribe here:https://www.youtube.com/petrikleoHere it is, the beginning of the trilogy that sparked my love for reading fantasy novels.It’s been exactly one year ten months since I first joined Goodreads or started readingThe Final Empirefor the first time; it was on September 1st, 2016. There’s no doubt thatThe Final Empireis an extremely important book for me. It’s not easy for me to elaborate upon this; a cliché such as “I absolutely love this book” is not enough, and the reason behind the significance of this trilogy for me will have to be postponed until I’m done with rereadingThe Hero of Ages. The impact that this trilogy left on my life is immeasurable, and my life before and after I finished this trilogy for the first time is a different one from each other. I predict this will happen within a week or two from now, but for now, let’s talk aboutThe Final Empire, and why—even upon reread—it’s an absolutely incredible start to a trilogy.Picture:The Final Empireby breath-artThe Final Empireis the first book in Brandon Sanderson’s highly acclaimedMistborntrilogy. For a thousand years, the world has been ruled with an iron fist by the immortal emperor: Lord Ruler. The main plot of the book revolves around a rebellion to overthrow the lord ruler; this rebellion is built around a heist led by Kelsier, his team, and his newly found apprentice—Vin. I immensely enjoyed readingThe Final Empire; the first time I read this novel, I found the plot to be thoroughly engaging, relatable, and at times humorous due to the character’s camaraderie and banter. And I was also completely fascinated by the world-building and magic system that Sanderson has created here. On reread, all of these are still true, but there’s a new additional superb quality: all the foreshadowing and hints are now laid bare for me to see with the gift of hindsight.The Final Empire, on its own, works perfectly as a standalone, but trust me that there’s so much more to the story beyond this book. Everything you read here—even the mini details—played major parts in the upcoming sequels.""Plots behind plots, plans behind plans. There was always another secret.”Picture:Kelsier and Vinby GisAlmeidaWhere should I even begin with the wonderful characterizations? I guess I’ll start with Vin. I’ve read more than 200 books since the first time I finished reading this trilogy, and Vin—by the end of the trilogy—still stands strong as one of my favorite heroines of all time. This, of course, doesn’t mean that Vin was the only great character from the series; Kelsier, Sazed, Elend, and many other characters were so memorable as well. I can’t mention them all in this review because their greatness hasn’t occurred yet here. Ever since I read this book for the first time, I’ve heard from several readers that they found Vin to be incredibly emo and annoying; I disagree with this. Vin had a rough past. I think Sanderson did a great job in conveying Vin’s insecurity and emotions. Vin’s thoughts felt believable to me, and I found her character’s development to be amazing. She taught me that despite being betrayed and left behind countless times, it’s always okay—and better—to love and trust someone again rather than being alone. And then Kelsier taught me about the meaning of justice and hope; it’s not okay to stand still in the face of tyranny, oppression, and slavery.“Men rarely see their own actions as unjustified.”Sazed taught me that differences in faith can still lead to being respectful and kind towards each other’s beliefs.“Our belief is often strongest when it should be weakest. That is the nature of hope.”There were plenty of things to learn from the character’s actions in the book. But for now, I want to discuss the next highlight of the novel—and trilogy—itself: the magic system.The Final Empireintroduced us to Allomancy and Feruchemy. Honestly speaking, coming from a gaming and manga/anime background, I thought I would never encounter a magic system as good as the one often told in these two mediums within a novel format. However, I was proven wrong. Allomancy is amazing, and it’s still by far my favorite magic system in the entire fantasy genre. Yes, I think it’s even better than the one shown in Sanderson’s magnum opus—The Stormlight Archive—so far. The intricacy of the magic system that Sanderson has crafted inMistborn Saganever ceased to amaze me, and I’ve yet to encounter a more engaging, complex, and amazingly easy-to-understand magic system in any other fantasy novels. Plus, the actions spawned from the magic system resulted in some incredibly vivid and fast-paced battle sequences.This book was also my first encounter with Sanderson’s spectacular world-building. Accompanied with Sanderson’s accessible, vivid, and immersive prose, the world of Scadrial that’s clouded by ash and surrounded by mist felt extremely atmospheric to read. There was also a lot of well-built mystery and lore within this book; Sanderson used the epigraph at the beginning of each chapter masterfully. I’ve heard a lot of criticisms from several readers that Sanderson’s prose can be a bit too simple to their liking, and I can certainly agree that—not only this book—all of his books contain simplistic prose. However, that’s actually one of the things that I appreciate about his works. His writings never get in the way of the story, and he’s brilliantly capable of telling a story of epic proportion with his accessible writing style. And this doesn’t mean that the narrative is lacking in wisdom or impact. In my opinion, all of Sanderson’s books in theCosmereuniverse contained a lot of relatable wisdom easily applicable to our daily life. A few examples:“The right belief is like a good cloak, I think. If it fits you well, it keeps you warm and safe. The wrong fit however, can suffocate.”or this“You should try not to talk so much, friend. You'll sound far less stupid that way”And with that quote, I realized that it’s time for me to put an end to my review here. It’s safe to say that I still considerThe Final Empireas one of my favorite books and one of my favorite starts to a trilogy. My reread experience of this book has been better than I expected, and I can’t wait to see how the rest of the trilogy will hold up for me. Below here—just for fun, cringe, and nostalgia factors—is the first review I’ve ever written. Hopefully, I did a better job this time! :)You can order the book from:Book Depository (Free shipping)You can findthisand the rest of my reviews atNovel NotionsSpecial thanks to my Patrons onPatreonfor giving me extra support towards my passion for reading and reviewing!My Patrons: Alfred, Alya, Annabeth, Ben, Blaise, Devin, Diana, Dylan, Edward, Ellen, Gary, Hamad, Helen, Jimmy Nutts, Joie, Luis, Lufi, Melinda, Mike, Miracle, Nicholas, Sarah, Seth, Shaad, Summer, Wendy, Zoe.------------------------My first review on Goodreads and I'm really happy it's this book that I chose. The book have an amazing world-building, great characters development and most of all, very intricate magic system and actions. This is coming from someone who've seen plenty of magics (not real of course) from 20 years of gaming and watching anime/movie/television series. The amount of details Sanderson put into each words (not to mention it's really simple and easy to understand) is insane.I will definitely read the rest of the trilogy straight after this and more works by him!",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68428.Mistborn,Mistborn The Final Empire.txt
Daughter of the Moon Goddess,"Thank you to Netgalley for providing me an ARC!Ah yes, yet another ARC I read after it was released. In my defense, I did actually start it before it came out.I was so freaking excited about this book when I found out about it. First of all, Chang’e is one of my favorite Chinese myths (out of the admittedly small number that I know). Second of all, a female warrior protagonist? And an Ancient Chinese fantasy aesthetic setting? Yes.In reality, I wasa bit disappointed.I was expecting something so immersive and exciting, and while this book started out that way, it didn’t last and it wasn’t strong enough for me to really get that experience.Theplotfollows Xingyin, the daughter of Chang’e, the Moon Goddess. Her mother has been imprisoned by the Celestial Emperor for becoming an immortal, and when the Celestial Army threatens her mother, Xingyin is forced to flee from the palace of the moon.She lands herself - quite literally - in enemy territory, falling into the Celestial Kingdom itself. She earns a position as the Crown Prince Liwei’s companion, training alongside him in all things. From there, she struggles to find a path back to her mother while navigating the romance between herself and the Prince.I was honestly expecting more from the storyline. I wanted something more action-packed, more intense. I wanted to feel more emotions about the events of the book. But I just couldn’t.Too many things in the story were just too obviously rigged. It felt like they were there to keep things going without much real intrigue. There were so many time skips where Xingyin just says something like, “The next two years I spent by his side”, or, “I spent my time training and the months flew by.” I don’t want detailed depictions of every day, but this felt too much like the author trying to get to specific parts of the plot with minimal effort.The part where Xingyin enters the competition to become Liwei’s companion should have been so much more tense. A competition that, according to Xingyin, could change the course of her life - but it only took up a few pages?The events of the competition were so quick and way too easy that it was almost laughable. It was set up for Xingyin to win from the beginning, and that took away any excitement I as a reader had about that scene.“I was no longer a child willing to drift with the tide - I would steer against the current if I had to. And if I won, by some miraculous stroke of luck, I would never be helpless again.”Honestly, my main issue wasXingyin.Her decisions were what got her into this mess.“Oh, it’s the energy that my mother told me not to reach for! It can't be that bad, I’m going to reach for it!”I can understand her going into a ~rebellious teenager~ phase, but this one random instance just once again felt set up in order to advance the plot.Half of her problems were caused by her own stupid decisions.“Oh no, I have to join the Celestial Army now!”But technically she doesn’t because she could have just left at that point if she wanted to, and she only stayed out of a sense of obligation and because she was ~in love.~She as a character was very compelling, but her narrative wasn’t that exciting. I really enjoyed her development, and I loved the way she grew as a person through the book, but I didn’t feel a strong connection with her and therefore wasn’t as invested in her perspective.I liked that she was stubborn, and ambitious, and held herself to a high standard, but I feel like she as a person could have been developed so much more. I was fully prepared to enjoy her character and didn’t get to do that as much as I wanted to.“A glorious future beckoned on the horizon. Yet I still clung to a shred of my past, as a flowering peach blossom tree yearning for its fallen bloom.”Liweiwas an interesting character, but I liked him a lot better when he was first introduced compared to him later on. It felt like, instead of getting more fleshed out as Xingyin got to know him, he just gradually became more and more bland compared to his first impression.Honestly, he felt like a lot of other characters in a lot of other books. He was the Crown Prince who wasn’t interested in his responsibilities or betrothal arrangements, and all he wanted to do was paint and spend time training, but when it really came down to it he was invested in the good of his kingdom.“I do care,"" he ground out. ""Despite my sense, my judgement and honor - I cannot help but care.”Wenzhiwas very interesting but felt a little bit cliché as well. He was the famous army man who was known for his skill and had a distaste for the court he served. He was tough but understanding and had a very mentor vibe to him but then had a hidden romantic side. I thought he was interesting when he was introduced, being a powerful captain and seeming important to the story, but I stopped really paying attention after a few chapters.Theromancewas okay, but it just didn’t feel interesting. Xingyin and Liwei got along well and their banter was fine, but there wasn’t any of the “passionate romance” that the synopsis was promising.Also, the love triangle that developed about 40% into the book was completely unnecessary. It added nothing to the plot except for obliviousness on Xingyin’s part (“Why are these two attractive men competing for my attention and getting hostile toward each other whenever they’re in the same room”).Oh wait, I do know what this added. A healthy dose of not-like-other-girls™ to Xingyin’s character. I was not here for the“I’m not beautiful, why would these two men ever want me, I’m just average and plain - EVEN THOUGH I’M THE BEST ARCHER IN THE WORLD I HAVE THIS ONE TALENT”narrative.Xingyin was fine at first, but she gradually just became this stereotypical heroine. For example:“It was only later that I learned the Chamber of Lions was reserved for the army’s most skilled warriors. While most had taken months, a year even to master every trap, it took me a matter of weeks.”Wow she’s so strong and gifted, it doesn’t matter that she’s not pretty because she can do archery! And archery comes naturally to her!Honestly, a lot of this book just felt the same as other books I’ve read. The first-impression scene where Xingyin meets Liwei? They have an ~honest conversation™~ because he “just wants honest companionship” and “a break from court” and she doesn’t recognize him until someone calls him by his title. It was honestly the same as so many other stories that I’ve read and none of it felt special pertaining to either of the characters. I don’t see the appeal of this cliché anymore.What really saved this book for me was thewriting and the setting.The writing came across really nicely, and I liked the lyrical quality there was to the words. I’m a sucker for fantasy writing, and while this wasn’t the most flowery, gorgeous writing in existence, it really didn’t have to be. It melded with the story well and got across without an overuse of metaphors.“Some scars are carved into our bones - a part of who we are, shaping what we become.”The setting was beautiful, because I love ancient-Chinese mythology and I love the way mythological Asian settings come across. The intricacies of the world-building and descriptions of the environment were just so enjoyable.Overall,this book could have been so much better than it was for me. Maybe I just went in with too-high expectations, but can you really blame me?Yes. Yes you can.But still. I really wanted this to be more powerful, intense and immersive, and it just didn’t get there for me. It started out really strong and exciting, and something about it declined as I went.I enjoyed this book a lot, despite how salty I sound about it. It was beautiful and I liked the narrative, and while it wasn’t my favorite book ever, it was still a good one. I would absolutely recommend it. It just fell short of the hype for me.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57789637-daughter-of-the-moon-goddess,Daughter of the Moon Goddess.txt
The Way of Kings,"We have the freedom to express our opinions in beauty of subjectivity, and we should always fight and bite to keep that.But that's not the case I'm trying to make here with this review.I’m not trying to challenge anyone’s opinion or common sense when I say that by all measures of literature in history of mankind – and what paved the way for books, movies, songs we today call classics to be considered as such because of their unique quality – The Way of Kings(as well as its far worse sequel: Words of Radiance)is one of the worst books ever written.I tried as much as I could to share my thoughts in a thoughtful and respectful manner for all of you who love this book.And I believe that I do have an actual position (as an admirer of fantasy genre) that I feel obliged to argue.Especially when I see a problem.OK?OK.Onto the actual review, then.The only book I’ve read more times than this one wasLeo Tolstoy’s War and Peace.And the reason why I read War and Peace so many times was because upon each read I discovered something new that would grip me in Leo’s story; a new character and their perspectives I overlooked or experienced in a different way every other time I took the book in my hands.A true masterpiece and a classic that rightfully stands against the time, in spite being written well over a century ago.Am I actually trying to draw a comparison between War and Peace and The Way of Kings?God, no!The only similarity these two books have, luckily, is that both are just that – books.In everything else they fail in comparison.But, I have seen many people calling The Way of Kings both a masterpiece and an instant classic of the genre.I admit, on my first two reads, I was inclined to agree. I understand all of you who think and say that.Because I was one of you. I was enamored and infatuated by scope and magnitude of what I was reading.I never thought that someone could make a story where people are fighting over a heart of a giant crab and make it sound serious.I never thought that you could read about bunch of knights, dressed as medievalPower Rangers,wielding giant swords that were made out of pure essence, which would appear in their hands out of thin air(or morning mist)when they would call them with their minds – and not come out as a dork high on sugar.It was important to me because I was one of those dorks high on sugar.I thought – what most of you are right now quite unimaginatively repeating in unison – that this book was exclusively nothing but: amazing.Now?I’m deeply ashamed of myself for having such a high opinion of this book.So, what happened in-between my first two reads in 2011 and 2012 and this one at the end of 2017?Well, the answer is quite simple:I read better books than this one.Better books with richer worlds, more beautiful prose and far more developed characters.Better series with less inconsistencies in it, less plotholes and less… well, problems overall.Better authors that were more focused on quality of what they were writing about - where you can actually recognize their effort to make a book better;than quantity - when after first two reads and beginners infatuation by the scope and magnitude of what you were dealing with, few years later when you try to reread what you, in your ignorance, were believing was an‘instant classic’,is nothing more than a shallow, 800 pages far too long, rambling.So, the actual rating for this book is 2.25/5.How come exactly 2.25?Well, because of the chart. This one:And the long list of problems that prevented numbers on that chart from going higher.What problems?Let’s start with the biggest one for me.Characterization.The fun starts, with - what I will repeat is - probably one of the best described confusion of battle I have ever read. Anywhere.And whoever experienced a battle in real life, or at least playedCoDonline, or really, really carefully was trying to figure out what baseball is about, probably knows of confusion I’m talking about.(And if you’re wondering, yes, I experienced all three above – baseball is the worst. By far.)It’s a really great scene where you are put in this situation where you don’t have any knowledge of terrain, where you are depraved of‘bird’s perspective’in which you can'see'battle on the east flank, or what happens on the west side, so that you can act accordingly.No, here, all you can see are sweating bodies; hear yelling and cursing; and smell gore and piss.You’re a puppet, you know you’re a puppet, and like one, they move you all around.And in this chapter we are introduced to our main protagonist. OurJesus,ourSupermanof the story.With his almost omnipotent power he’s expressing, he tries to take care of those who can’t do that for themselves, and you can see in his saddened gaze – which is due to undoubtedly his equally sad and tragic past – weight of the entire world, threatening to crash him underneath.Yet he stands.Resolute.Until the next chapter where we see him in shackles, with broken spirit, strolling away as a slave toShattered Plains,where he will carry bridges into war across the chasms, towards revolution and freedom for all!(Now insert a petty sarcasm ""over 6000"" here):Nooo, I haveneverseen a character such as this!It never, ever, crossed my mind thatKaladin(our main protagonist) is a Jesus and Superman in one, withPeter Pan’s Tinkerbelle (Syl)on his shoulders as, not just as a moral compass, but a source of his powers to, let’s say, I don’t know, maybe even fly…And yes, I’m ashamed of this as well, because it took me two reads to realize similarities between Peter Pan and Tinkerbelle and Kaladin and Syl.So, now that we are on Shattered Plains… wow, wow, wow, wow… where are you going?You thought we were moving forward?No, no, no, no, this book doesn’t work like that. No…In order for us to move forward with characterization of our main protagonist, we have to go:back.Into the 800 pages long info-dumps.Oh yes.Oh no!Ramifications of this atrocity called:‘characterization through characters past’will be significant in future.First two books ofThe Stormlight Archiveseries are the most dangerous thing that happened to this genre.In 50 years, when historians will bang their heads in an effort to find roots of a downfall of epic fantasy as a genre, they’ll find its roots here. In this very book.It started already. Just this year alone I have read two books by an author who said he was inspired byBrandon Sanderson.And he did this exact same thing. He build a character by telling his past.And… do you know what some of you who read those books said about that approach of building a character?You called it an info-dump.It’s really interesting how you failed to recognize and you actually praised that same approach here, where that kind of fallacy practically came from. Oh well…Who knows how many of new, aspiring authors will be inspired by this kind of approach.All because none of us told Sanderson thatTHIS - DOESN'T - WORK.‘So what’,you’ll say.‘Surely there’s no a definitive answer what characterization is or isn’t.’Except, there is. There are books actually written about it. With carefully dissected examples of what throughout the history of literature and media all around us today, worked as a story, plot or characterization and, more importantly, what didn’t worked.And when I compared those examples of undoubted quality in long history with what Brandon tried here with, not just his characters but overall, in this book, it’s really not that much of a surprise that The Way of Kings doesn’t stand to a test of time.Not even three years passed when I noticed first problems, when I read more than 100 books of this genre and realized:‘Oh my God, there are far better books than this one.’.In essence, my problem with Kaladin’s characterization is this.You can show a character going through many changes in a story, but not all of them represent character change.True character change involves a challenging and changing of basic beliefs, leading tonewmoral action by the hero.What happens when we exclude stories about his past(those infamous info-dumps),stories that tells us how Kaladin’s character was shaped and came to be to the point where we meet him in his first chapter?Let's ask ourselves a question:Who exactly is Kaladin when we meet him for the first time?A capable young man who cares deeply about people in his unit, people he feels responsible for due to his tragic past. And he is willing to negotiate and work with people with whom he fundamentally disagrees. Lighteyes.Who is Kaladin at the end of the book?A capable young man who cares deeply about people in his unit, people he feels responsible for due to his tragic past. And he is willing to negotiate and work with people with whom he fundamentally disagrees. Lighteyes.Spot the differences there?No?Didn't think so.Let’s say I’m a potter. And I have a vase I want to reshape into something else. I start turning the wheel, reshaping and reshaping it – only to end up with a same vase again.Question is: why? Why spending my time, my efforts and my resources reshaping something into exactly the same thing itwasin the first place?And one can maybe argue:‘Well, it’s the journey, not the destination.’If the entirety of a journey is simply running in circles, then I’ll accept that. Because that’s exactly what happened here.Kaladin started from point 'A', went into journey of self-doubt and self-preservation, only to end up back at the same point 'A' he begin with.And that’s absolutely fine. Those are all changes.But that’s not characterization.Brandon keeps repeating this same mistake throughout this entire series.And do you know why I gave characterization of this book 2 and not 1?Apply all of which I've said about building Kalladin's character to a character ofAdolin Kholin.Who he is at the beginning and the end, moral conflicts that shaped his character inside of one cohesive story etc...Vast improvement.And do you know whose character is one constantly good thing throughout these five reads?Adolin Kholin, yes.Wonder why is that...About female characters I'll say only this: When you insist on copying female characters you created inElantrisandWarbreaker,and simply paste them from next series to next - I will call you on it.Sarene, Siri, Vivenna, ShallanandJasnahare all one and the same character.You make me miss thatMistborn'svery own Mary Sue:Vin.And just to be clear, female characters are not the only ones that get this unimaginative treatment.We have this reminiscent sidekicks:Teft.A blindly devoted, desperate in need of worshiping someoneGalladonfrom Elantris knock-off.Yes, Teft from The Way of Kings serves exactly the same purpose for main character in this book as did Galladon for main character of Elantris.Now, we only need someone who'll, like Galladon in Elantris, constantly repeat nonsense in a local dialect... something likesuleorkolo...Ah,Lopen,there you are! Yes,gancho,you, get over here,gon!I swear I see a pattern here...Worbuilding.I want to express gratitude for immense amount of effort Brandon’s team put up into creating artwork for this book. It’s really amazing, from cover itself, through maps to interior art.Just look at this map:Just look at it. Such beauty to look upon.Only to look upon, because, sadly, out of all of that, for almost two entire books we’ll spend time only on eastern barren cliffs.So, this glorious, beautiful map? You don’t need it. For two books you’ll experience three percent of it.(Red X marks the spot)Cliffs. Chasms and giant crabs.1100 pages long behemoth of a book and we’re left wondering not just how 97% of the world looks like, but also how society works on some basic levels.But I guess it was far more important to tell us that alcohol comes in variety of colors.And tease some cameo appearances in interludes that, as of yet, don’t serves to the main story.Prose.I passionately disagree with this logic how“If you’re not a writer and if you’re not eloquent enough in writing your own reviews”you shouldn’t criticize author’s prose.Do I need to be a mechanic to say that my wheel has fallen off?Do I need to be a firefighter to say that my house is burning?No?So why do I need to be a writer myself to recognize and say that author of this book is preposterously bad at writing.It’s either that, or he considers me an idiot. I do have self-respect, so I’ll go with the first one.Brandon Sanderson is lightyears behind those authors I consider decent ones.And mind you, English is not my first, nor second language, but still I’m able to recognize vastness in differences between authors prose. It’s not really science.And if we combine his fetish of constant repeating and reminding us thatJasnah(written with a J but spoken with a Y – as I said, illiteracy cuts deep in this one) is a heretic and thatSadeaslacksShardblade,at least three times per chapter with boring, witless and cringeworthily dialogues - novel is unbearably bleak and blatantly ridiculous.Just a few examples:Sadeas and his far too many times now mentioned Shardblade:""Sadeas's hand had gone to his sword. Not a Shardblade, for Sadeas didn't have one.""""The highprince hated that Adolin had a blade while Sadeas had none""""Sadeas was calling for his grandbow.""Remember, this is all within a single 15 pages long chapter.Second - dialogues. Those awful, awful dialogues:“I can see you are a woman of discriminating taste.”“I am. I do like my meals prepared very carefully, as my palate is quite delicate.”“Pardon. I meant that you have discriminating taste in books.”“I’ve never eaten one, actually.”As well as pitiful attempts at witty banters and humor:""Each man has his place. Mine is to make insults. Yours is to be: in-sluts.""Barum tssss....And my favourite, Sanderson's signature over-the-top bullshit:""Today I went fishing and I caught one. Very lucky fish other fisherman said.Cures aching joints for a good month after you eat it, and sometimes let you see when friends were going to visit by letting you read the shapes of the sound.""I mean, at this point, why the hell not?Allegory.Nonexistent.OK, Sanderson fans, what is this book about? What is the meaning, what is he trying to say, what’s the message?Is this book about racism? Criticizing it? I hope so. Because in this book, everyone is racist. Including Kaladin, our main protagonist.What?And how would you call a person who because of actions of two people with distinctive physical characteristics now hates everyone with those same physical characteristic?That's a definition of racist. And that's also Kaladin's POV.But, he's not the only one, no.Lighteyes people are basically Nazis. They hate anyone non-lighteye.Darkeyes people, or a common folk, of course, hate lighteyes and, because society thought them that way, they hate these slaves, these Parsh people.Parshendi, which are equivalent to Native American people... well, they hate everyone. Including themselves.And since everyone, Lighteyes, Darkeyes and Parshendi hate Parsh people, people who did no harm to anyone else, and who literally serve as slaves in this book - it only fits to make them as main villains, right?I told you this book is filled with Sanderson's over the top bullshit, didn't I?It’s a paradox how the only compliant and peaceful in collective discrimination of their race are mute, blackParshslaves which aren’t even consider as humans. But like that wasn’t enough in this, ocean of ridiculousness, by the end of this book they are proclaimed as story’s main antagonists.Empty vessels that could be filled with nothing but evil spirits.And on top of that, you'll add Shallan, our female lead, who'll say something along these lines:""Oh, but maybe they don't actually want to be free.""Thank you and goodnight.All in all, I understand everyone who likes this book and this series. It's just that I have read better books in my life, since my first read of this one. And the way I'm looking at reading books and what I seek in them - The Way of Kings simply doesn't provide anymore.It's a shame he got lazy in creating these worlds. But given how his readers will glorify everything he does, he would be crazy not to exploit that.Oh well...",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7235533-the-way-of-kings,The Way of Kings.txt
The Name of the Wind,"I tried very hard to like this book. I wanted to like it. Critics liked it. Authors I enjoy liked it. But, try as I might, I did not agree with them.Before I get into what I didn't like, I will take a moment to acknowledge what I thought Rothfuss did well.GOOD STUFF1. The structure of the book was neat: a renowned hero recounting his life and demystifying the stories surrounding him.I like the idea of an adult criticizing the actions and beliefs of his younger self (Jacqueline Carey does this nicely in Kushiel's Dart). And I like the idea of the narrator's story being recorded as he tells it.2. The University setting was fun, even if it did feel too 20th century.I was excited to see a character attend school and slowly gain rank. (Unfortunately, Kvothe was promoted to graduate studies after about three days. Sorry, I'll save that for later; this section is supposed to be for Good Stuff.)3. Elodin was the one character I really liked, even if he was peripheral.He was one of the few that stood out as an individual. Then again, he got Kvothe to jump off a building, which is always a plus in my book.4. While Kvothe was not believable as a child when on the road with his parents or at the University (see Bad Stuff), he was believably young while living in Tarbean.I enjoyed this section of the book the most because it displayed his intelligence and resourcefulness through believable actions.And that's all I have for Good Stuff. Sorry.BAD STUFF1. The gaudy plastic star at the top of this fake Christmas tree of a list of grievances is Kvothe himself.It would be an understatement to say that I did not like his character. I found him unbelievable and derivative and written. I felt no emotional investment in him. At no point in the story did I worry he would make it out okay. At no point did he surprise me.One of my biggest problems with Kvothe was his age. He did not sound or act like a believable child (with the exception of Tarbean, as mentioned.) Moreover, he had to be a genius.Why?I am genuinely asking this. If you have an answer, let me know. So far, I have found no reason for Kvothe to be a child genius. It did not add anything to the story. There was no reason for him to learn so much adult material at age ten other than that it was a convenient time for him to do so. There was no reason for him to enter University at age fifteen other than that it was impressive. He didn't even act like a child or young teen. Why not age him so his thoughts and actions would make sense?Even his perceptions of the world as a child were remarkably adult. For example, his descriptions of his parents focus on what a great couple they were, snippets of their sexual banter, how attractive his mother was, and his hoping that they had a good sex life. These are not the thoughts of a ten-year-old child. Nor were these thoughts filtered in the narration as the reminiscences of Adult Kvothe. Child Kvothe seemed to regard his parents as a romantic couple, rather than mom and dad, who love him but also cramp his style from time to time.Kvothe's dialogue was far too adult and ""witty"" for his age. Show of hands, guys. How many of you gave perfectly polished speeches and witty retorts and spoke in well-received metaphors at age fifteen? I know I didn't. I could have forgiven a lot of this if Kvothe was portrayed as having a quick mouth but an immature mind, but even his moments of pride or stupidity still felt like the actions of an adult.And, of course, he had to be a genius. Advanced medical and magical knowledge at age ten? No problem! He can't afford to pay tuition at University? That's okay, because Kvothe is just so gosh-darned impressive that the school pays him to attend. A teacher attempts to humiliate him in class? Not only does Kvothe teach the teacher a lesson, but he is allowed to skip his entire undergrad education, because he is just that smart. Kvothe participates in the city's most difficult musical challenge that takes talented musicians years to pass? He's so amazing that he succeeds on the first try, and the audience is literally crying at the beauty of his music.Need I go on?Yes, I do, because in addition to Kvothe's never having to struggle with learning something or mastering a concept, there are all sorts of horrible retcons explaining his talents. For example, at one point Kvothe (age ten or eleven) needs to survive alone in the wild for a few months. Ideally, this could be a good learning experience of trial and error, but then we get a few paragraphs explaining that, by the way, one time this dude traveled with Kvothe's family and taught him all about trapping and skinning animals, how to build a shelter, how to start a fire, and what plants are good to eat. And we learn this just a few paragraphs before Kvothe's survival.How convenient.This challenge is no longer a challenge because Kvothe knows exactly what to do.Another example: Kvothe skips town to travel somewhere for plot reasons. He chooses to do this by traveling 70 miles on horseback in one day. (Yes, 70 miles in one day and ononehorse. But that's not even the bad part.) Again, at this point in the story, I thought this could be a good challenge: struggling to ride through the elements, learning how to work with the horse, and facing obstacles along the way. But again, we get a neat aside about how, by the way, Kvothe is a master horseman, because he grew up with horses, and so he knows how to ride and care for them, and how to pick out a good horse for this kind of journey. And again, we learn this about a paragraph before he mounts the horse and rides off.My problem with the above two examples is that Kvothe's ""learned"" skills become tidy deus ex machinas for the situations he has to overcome. Instead of learning how to survive in the wild, we are told that he already knows how to do that, so what was the point of making this a challenge? Instead of struggling to travel 70 miles with or without the constant demands of a horse, we are told that he is good at that too and he succeeds with little difficulty, taking all suspense and interest out of the scene. It would be one thing if, earlier and throughout the story, we saw him snaring rabbits or caring for his parents' horses (a.k.a. demonstrating his skills before they became necessary for the plot). The way these skills were presented felt cheap.(Never mind that, even if he was a master horseman, riding 70 miles in one day would be hell on his body. Particularly after not riding for five years. And Kvothe was ""sore"" the next day? He should not have been able to walk.)Not only is Kvothe a genius and talented at everything, but nothing in his narrative voice suggests that we are listening to the brain of a genius. Nothing in his diction, rhythm, or tone indicates this. I could accept a genius character if his voice reflected an unusual mind, but Kvothe pretty much just sounded like an everyman.I became so tired of Kvothe's perfection, of how impressive and smart he was, of how he breezed past obstacles that could have been character-building. He is one of the clearest examples of a Gary Stu I have ever read.2. I was going to call this category ""portrayal of women,"" but women are not really a part of this story.They exist to give birth (Kvothe's mom), be rescued (Fela), or fawn over Kvothe in wonder (pretty much every woman in the book). The only female character we spend much time with is Denna, so this category is for her.I found Denna to be spectacularly dull. I did not understand what Kvothe saw in her other than that she was hot. Attempts to make her mysterious and intriguing did not work for me. She is a pretty face hopping from man to man for money. (And, supposedly, she's really smart, so why doesn't she go to University too? Or get a job?)The passages devoted to Kvothe and Denna alone together were the most boring parts of the book. For being a couple of fifteen-year-olds, their dialogue was crammed with big metaphors and polished, ""witty"" one-liners.I was going to make suggestions on improving her character, but at this point, I don't care. She could have a dark backstory and I wouldn't care. She could be one of the freaking Chandrian and I wouldn't care. I cannot stress enough how much I didn't care about this character, and that's probably one of the worst things I could say about a work of fiction.3. While I did like the structure of the book (opening in third-person present day, switching to Kvothe's first-person narrative of his past), it did have its problems.Namely, the characters in the present day were poorly developed. I would have liked to know more about Bast and the Chronicler; hell, from their few interactions, I'd like to read a book just about them.Throughout the book, the narrative returns to Bast and the Chronicler. At these points, Kvothe clears up misconceptions and foreshadows later events, which was fun, even if his dialogue was plagued with too many permutations of ""If this was a story, XYZ would happen, but this is not a story."" The narrative usually returned to Bast and the Chronicler after dramatic things were recounted from Kvothe's life, and we saw their reactions.Did Kvothe just tell them something funny? Then Bast and the Chronicler are roaring with laughter. Did Kvothe relay how he did something amazing and clever? Then his listeners are wide-eyed in awe. Did Kvothe reveal something sad? Then they are crying huge tears of sorrow, and the Chronicler is wiping his eyes on the back of his hand, and Bast is croaking, ""I never knew!"" on repeat.The lampshading in this book was pretty bad.I do not like the author telling me how to feel, thanks. If an event in the book is truly sad and written well, then I will touch on my own sad experiences and bond with the characters. But being shown how Kvothe's audience laughed and cried at everything he shared with them felt a lot like watching a sitcom with a laugh track. This was made even worse when Bast would exclaim how sad an event in Kvothe's life was, and then Kvothe would say something along the lines of, ""Yes, it was terrible, but I still did not know real sorrow because even worse was yet to come.""Stop. Readers engage with emotions eagerly. You do not need to tell us how we should be reacting.4. This book felt largely plotless.Yes, it is the first installment of a trilogy and thus an incomplete fraction of Kvothe's life. But a good book can stand alone, even if it is part of a larger work. In a well written and well plotted series, one book will contribute to the overarching plot, but also resolve its own.There was no definable plot here. ""Kvothe grows up in a few different places and goes to school"" is not a plot. ""Kvothe wants to learn the truth about the Chandrian but learns pretty much nothing about them"" is not a plot.Arguably, since this trilogy is a recording of Kvothe's life, it doesn't need a plot. After all, my life doesn't have a definable plot. But I think that argument can only extend so far in fiction. A book is not real life. The story needs to have a shape.Kvothe's accumulation of skills and knowledge did not equip him to handle a major threat at the end of the book. His time at the University did not culminate in a big struggle for him to come out on top of (only minor incidents). He didn't learn much about the Chandrian. We still know nothing about Denna and things between her and Kvothe haven't changed. Kvothe did come to terms with his grief, but that happened about halfway through the book.Moreover, his struggles were mostly comprised of outside forces, such as being poor or bullies being mean to him. With a few exceptions, I did not feel that he grew as a character from overcoming these obstacles. Some of this is due to the aforementioned retcons (by the way, Kvothe is a master horseman, despite us never seeing evidence of this in the previous 500 pages.) And some of this is due to how he overcomes his external obstacles in external ways.Crisis! Kvothe is so poor that he cannot afford room and board at University. Good thing he succeeds at that super difficult music competition on the first try, thus giving him bragging rights and the ability to play for money pretty much anywhere in the city.Crisis! A giant, vegetarian dragon is chasing him down. Good thing Kvothe literally stumbled upon barrels and barrels of a lethal drug to knock the beast out.Crisis! Kvothe is banned from the University Archives. Good thing he happens to meet this weird woman who lives in the underbelly of the school, and who can show him a secret entrance to he Archives.And the like.There's nothingnecessarilywrong with these struggles--except that they happen over and over and over again. Very rarely does Kvothe face problems brought on by his own arrogance/stupidity/etc.; it's just the World hurling problems at him. And I, for one, appreciate characters who have agency--both to get themselves out of trouble, but into more plot. I am even more appreciative of characters who breathe, make mistakes, and change.I did not get this from Kvothe. The Kvothe I met at the start of the book (for either timeline) was the same as the Kvothe I ran away from on the last page. When I stood Beginning Kvothe and Ending Kvothe side by side, I couldn't tell the difference.The character did not have enough agency to shape a gripping plot, and the plot did not shape a gripping character.This book did not have enough of a shape for me.ULTIMATELY...While I did not like this book, at the very least, I can credit it for demonstrating errors to avoid in my own writing.I know a lot of people loved this book, and I would like to know why. Genuinely. Tell me what I'm missing.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/186074.The_Name_of_the_Wind,The Name of the Wind.txt
Emily Wilde's Encyclopaedia of Faeries,"In a Nutshell:An entertaining and quirky read that will work well for fantasy readers. Well-carved characters, interesting writing. Gets a bit dark at times.Story Synopsis:1909. Thirty-year-old Cambridge Professor Dr. Emily Wilde lives life with a single-minded purpose – she wishes to complete her encyclopaedia of Faerie Folk and does all she can to complete this goal, even if it means suffering the company of other people, the most irritating of whom is her colleague and rival Wendell Bambleby.When she arrives in the remote village of Hrafnsvik, she has no desire to mingle with its denizens. However, soon she realises that Hrafnsvik is full of Fae mysteries and to unlock them, she needs the support of its residents. When the ever-charming Bambleby also turns up at the village, Emily knows she has to make some tough choices.The story comes to use through Emily’s (first person) entries in the journal she maintains as a part of her research.Where the book worked for me:😍 The story has appealing characters who are detailed out really well. Emily might be tough for some to like, but her introverted nature and her passion for organising and planning her work list made me feel rather close to her. Wendell is beyond description – he starts off as a self-obsessed snoot but his character starts peeling off its layers quite interestingly as the story progresses. Many of the village folk, while in small roles, have equally interesting character arcs. Can’t forget Emily’s pet canine Shadow – he’s adorable!😍 Emily is a stubborn and demanding social recluse while Wendell is her exact opposite. Yet the two of them have a connection that is tough to resist. I loved their repartee and their easy camaraderie despite resistance from Emily’s side. I hope the next book in the series takes their arc ahead well without becoming clichéd.😍 There are also plenty of lore characters in the story, not all of whom are commonly seen in this genre. They add a fabulous touch of magic to the proceedings. Mind you, things do get dark at times but not so much as would creep you out.😍 I appreciate Emily’s journals being used as a narrative device. While this approach leads to some foreshadowing of what happened that day, it also ensures a focussed narration due to Emily’s very nature. There is not much focus on descriptions, but there is enough of it to make the little village come alive in our minds.😍 As the first of a series, the book ends really well. The important arcs are closed, and yet we have an inclination of where the story might go next. No cliffhangers.😍 Some plot developments caught me unawares but the author handled the unexpected nicely. It feels nice to be surprised when you aren’t expecting any deviations from the norm.😍 The book is somewhat slow-paced, but the plot was such that I didn’t even feel like speed-reading. Every scene contributes to the story in some way or another.Where the book could have worked better for me:😑 There are a couple of folktales in between and at the end. These took away from the tempo of the main plot. (I did love the stories; I just wish they weren’t bang in the middle of the story we were invested in.)😑 This is a complaint you will hardly ever hear me make. I wanted more of the romance! (Okay, okay, I know this isn’t marketed as a romance, but c’mon! It was like being offered a scrumptious cake but getting only one lick of it. I am hungry for more!)All in all, despite the somewhat roundabout pacing, I loved the story for its characters and its writing approach. I’m definitely on board for the next in the series. Can’t wait to see where the author leads Emily and Wendell!4.25 stars.My thanks to Little, Brown Book Group UK and NetGalley for the DRC of “Emily Wilde's Encyclopaedia of Faeries”.

The Will of the Many,"ARC provided by the publisher—Saga Press—in exchange for an honest review.This is not an exaggeration.The Will of the Manyby James Islington is the best fantasy book with a magical school trope I’ve ever read sinceThe Name of the Windby Patrick Rothfuss.“The power to protect is the highest of responsibilities… When a man is given it, his duty is not only to the people he thinks are worthy.”James Islington instantly became one of my favorite authors withThe Licanius Trilogy. Since then, I knew I would need to read every new book written by him, and that's whyThe Will of the Many, together withLight Bringerby Pierce Brown and the four secret novels by Brandon Sanderson, reached the top of my most anticipated releases of this year. It's not a good habit to have high expectations toward any book as that makes us prone to disappointment. But I couldn't resist it here. I didn't know what the story inThe Will of the Manywould be, and I still entered it with very high expectations because I loved how satisfying Islington completed the complexity ofThe Licanius Trilogy. And luckily, Islington managed to exceed my unreasonably high expectations withThe Will of the Many, the first book in theHierarchyseries. As far as the first book of a series goes, this one tops overThe Shadow of What Was Lostin every possible way, and I think many of you know how much I enjoyedThe Licanius Trilogyby now. To be more precise,The Will of the Manyis Islington's best novel so far in his career. It is, at the very least, even though it is a different kind of book, up there with the quality produced inThe Light of All That Falls. This is a contender for the best book of 2023. By the end of this year, the competition is fierce, but I will be shocked ifThe Will of the Manydid not—at least—end up in my top 5 books of the year. And I will tell you why in this review.The Catenan Republic—the Hierarchy—may rule the world now, but they do not know everything. He tells them his name is Vis Telimus. He tells them he was orphaned after a tragic accident three years ago, and good fortune alone gives him a chance to enter their most prestigious school: The Catenan Academy. He tells them that once he graduates, he will gladly join the rest of civilized society in allowing his strength, drive, and focus—what they call Will—to be leeched away and added to the power of those above him, as millions already do. As all must eventually do. Vis tells them that he belongs, and they believe him. But the truth is that Vis has been sent to enter the Catenan Academy to find answers. To solve a murder. To search for an ancient weapon. To uncover secrets that may tear the Republic apart. And that he will never, ever cede his Will to the empire that executed his family. To survive, though, Vis will have to rise through the Academy’s ranks. He will have to smile, make friends, pretend to be one of them and win. If he fails, then those who want to control him, who know his real name, will no longer have any use for him. And if the Hierarchy ever finds out who Vis truly is, they will kill him.This is the blurb forThe Will of the Many. If you’re familiar with Pierce Brown’s sci-fi seriesRed Rising Saga, you might notice the similarities in the premise. For context, inRed Rising, Darrow is a Red, the lowest rank in the hierarchy of labor within the color-coded society of the series. The Gold is the ruler of humanity, and they have done irrevocable actions to Darrow and the Red for many years. So Darrow has to masquerade as a Gold and increase his fame and prestige through the rank of Gold to fulfill his revenge.Red Rising Sagais one of my favorite series of all time, and yes, the similarities withRed Risingcan definitely be spotted inThe Will of the Many. Even more so because Vis has a personality that is quick to anger like Darrow, and the world-building of these two series is heavily Roman-inspired as well; more on this later. But more importantly, the premise and the Roman-inspired world-building are where the similarities end.“A man is nothing if he does not honour his debts.”The Will of the Manyis a different kind of book compared toRed Rising. This is not like the controversial case thatThe First Bindingby R. R. Virdi has withThe Name of the Windby Patrick Rothfuss. This 240,000 words long novel never felt derivative to me. It's the other way around; with more pages read inThe Will of the Many, especially after the insane ending, the more I feelThe Will of the Manyas a whole package, as expected of Islington, is another incredibly distinct, ambitious, and mind-blowing work of art. From my assessment, it would be more exact to say if you love the premise and world-building portrayed inRed Rising Saga, it's very possible you will end up lovingThe Will of the Many. Especially if you love the magical school or academy setting and trope too.If you’ve readThe Licanius Trilogy, you will know that plotting is one of the finest aspects of the trilogy. I’m pleased to mention Islington’s strength as a mostly planner storyteller (I believe every writer is a mix of both) returns powerfully inThe Will of the Many. My mind is still reeling as I write this review. I cannot stop thinking about all the events that transpired in this novel and their crazy implications for the rest of the series. Only a special fantasy series can make me feel this effect right after reading the first—out of the planned three or four—installments. I predictThe Hierarchywill be more than a trilogy, but that remains to be seen. I am not comparing which is better here as a storyteller: a pantser or a planner. Both have their merits. However, I believe Islington has showcased the best aspects of being a—mostly—planner type of storyteller inThe Licanius Trilogywith his meticulous story structure and well-placed revelations, and I can already see these factors being implemented magnificently here. This is all splendidly realized without any sacrifice in pacing. The pacing was engrossing from cover to cover for me.The blurb and I have mentioned the enrollment into the prestigious Catenan Academy. I do not think of this as a spoiler; similar to readers talking about Kvothe entering The University inThe Kingkiller Chronicleor Harry Potter entering Hogwarts, just a few examples. Both series take place in a magical school setting, the same asThe Will of the Many. But to set expectations accordingly, let me be clear that Vis' tale in the Catenan Academy did not start until we reached Part II of the book: Deus Nolens Exituus. (Get Results Whether God likes it or not.) That's 35% into the book, and by approximation, I think about 50% of the story actually takes place in The Catenan Academy. Part I of the story, Imperium Sine Fine (An Empire without an End), was the setup and foundation. This is the introductory section, and it depicts Vis’ merciless training montage and preparation under the tutelage of Lanistia before he enters the Academy. Additionally, the foundational stage and the training montage were never uneventful. Islington efficaciously made the three parts of the narrative here have their own overarching story arc (beginning, middle section, and concluding chapters) while being seamlessly connected to one another. If you already have a great time reading Part I, you will be gripped with the rest of the book. This, of course, comes with a caveat that the magical school or academy trope and setting is one of your favorites.The Will of the Manyis a book about ambition, justice, greed, vengeance, friendship, leadership, loyalty, knowledge, and family. And although these were on some level established since Part I, they were extensively integrated into the narrative in Part II and Part III: In Cauda Venenum (The Poison is in the Tail); once Vis is in The Catenan Academy, an academy that rewards greed and victory above all else. A magic school setting in fantasy is constantly irresistible to me. I have no idea when I will be over this trope, but it is not anytime soon. I am confident in that. I cannot help it, okay? Whether in novels, manga, or video games, I have many of my favorite adult fantasy stories centers or starts in a magical or battle school setting. It is one of my favorite tropes of all time. There is something about training montages, learning new abilities and skills, overcoming challenges, and defeating bullies or horrible teachers while forming friendships that always feel satisfying and relatable. These factors in fantasy novels, paired with the magical school trope, and a main character that earned my investment, have a good chance of becoming one of my favorite books. They are some of my favorite escapism. Assuming they are done right, of course, andThe Will of the Manyis a good example where all of these were infused incredibly well.A few comments have stated they did not feel connected to the main characters ofThe Licanius Trilogydue to its heavily plot-focused storyline, except for Caeden. Although I do not fully agree with this notion, because I liked Davian, Wirr, Asha, and many characters in the trilogy enough, I certainly agree Caeden is the best character inThe Licanius Trilogy; Caeden IS one of my favorite characters in the fantasy genre. It is with a heart full of happiness I say it is very likely Vis will become a character I love as much as Caeden in the future. Try not to misinterpret what I said as a criticism towardThe Licanius Trilogy.The Licanius Trilogyis one of my favorite trilogies. My point is that Islington has developed further as a storyteller; with more books in the series available in the future, the potential forHierarchyseries to be better thanThe Licanius Trilogyis strongly evident. If I am already this compelled and invested in Vis and his story just from readingThe Will of the Many, what would be the outcome after reading the sequels? I am excited to find out.“Whether the obstacles to our advancement arise from our ties or our actions, we need to learn to overcome them ourselves. It’s not fair, but nor is the world.”I found Vis to be a character reminiscent of Kvothe or Darrow. Forged by his brutal past, the rigorous physical and mental training he partakes from a young age has acted as an eternal fire of motivation that transformed him into a skillful fighter, intelligent, resourceful, a quick learner, and a jack of all trades. In other words, Vis is great at many things. However, he is not flawless. Vis lies a lot for survival and is often blinded by rage. This uncontrollable crimson veil of wrath often leads him toward conflicts or iconic moments, depending on how you look at the situation. His capacity for violence and fury is a weakness he needs to tame, and he soon realizes he cannot do everything by himself. This is why the unlikely friendship he forms in the Academy, especially with Callidus and Eidhin, gives him solace and hope amidst all the loneliness, dangers, and life-threatening allegiances he's juggling. Moments of virtue, loyalty, and solidarity were relatively rare and hard-earned, but the warmth of each one of these occurrences felt palpable; they radiated from the pages. All of these, along with Vis' inspiring courage, determination, and compassion, reinforce the unputdownable narrative for me.Islington's improved prose was responsible for my immersion and connection with the novel. Islington successfully nailed Vis' personality and voice so damn well. In science fiction & fantasy novels, it is frequently crucial for me to truly feel like the POV character is telling their story, not the author. The narrative has to completely enthrall me in the POV character's narration and inner thoughts. The best kind of SFF authors can do this. Here are some examples of an SFF series with excellent first-person POV narration. Fitz inThe Realm of the Elderlingsby Robin Hobb, Kvothe inThe Kingkiller Chronicleby Patrick Rothfuss, Darrow inRed Rising Sagaby Pierce Brown, and Tomas Piety inWar for the Rose Throneby Peter McLean with Tomas Piety. These four characters' narration felt like the author became the messenger with a mission to write and deliver their tales. And that, precisely, is what has been accomplished inThe Will of the Many. Islington’s writing style has the ability to conjure vivid imagery in my mind and an engaging reading experience effectively. And these praises are not exclusive to Vis. The entire story is told from the first-person POV narration (in present tense) of Vis, and yet, I still feel like I got to know the supporting characters' motivations and personalities almost as well as Vis. They are all unique with their own qualities.“You would be surprised at how far a combination of coin and favour can go toward silencing whole families.”Finally, before I close this long-enough review, I want to elaborate on the world-building of the series. When I readThe Will of the Many, it hit me that I haven’t read as much Roman-inspired epic fantasy series as I thought. I think this is a factor that increased my reading enjoyment. There isCodex Aleraby Jim Butcher, a popular Roman-inspired fantasy series. But, in my opinion,The Will of the Manyis multiple times superior. The world-building feels relatively fresh. Many aspects of the world-building inThe Will of the Manyare deeply rooted in its Roman inspiration. The names, clothing, beautiful vistas, settings, in-world game, and more. Every aspect of the Roman-inspired world and Islington's crafted fantasy lore were delivered in detail gradually. I did not feel overwhelmed by the terminologies, there is a character list and glossary at the back of the book every time I need to remind myself of something, and it did not take long for me to feel immersed in this Roman-inspired epic fantasy series. And I loved it. The gladiatorial bouts, the naumachia, the Catenan rankings, and how the magic system (Will, which I'm sure we will see even more of its usage in future sequels) is interweaved into the story. Everything felt so natural to the plotlines. Plus, there is, of course, Islington's own creation in the manifestation of the mystery of the ancient weaponry and Cataclysm, a world-spanning disaster three centuries ago that left less than five people in every hundred alive. Maybe it is more accurate to callThe Will of the Many, and the series, an epic science fantasy series due to how the high fantasy aspect and scientific technologies merged and enhanced the narrative. And I, as a fan of having more sci-fi elements in epic fantasy, am totally pleased by all of these combinations.The characters' development, in-depth lore, technologies, and history established inThe Will of the Manyhave provided possibilities for the Will and mysteries of the Cataclysm and more to be explored further in the next installments. This is also a darker novel than I expected. Explosions, massacres, shredded flesh and blood, and obsidian eyes and blades; the action scenes—the big action sequences, Labyrinth runs, or duels—were all tension-packed. Islington displayed the immense terror every second can bring in the lurking presence of disintegration and chaos. Violence begets grief, and grief begets violence. Is it a mistake, or is it righteous, to repay the sorrow caused by the heinous sins of the past with more violence of the present?The Will of the Manyclosed the magical/battle school/dark academia portion of the series, and that alone was already super satisfying. But oh my god... the mysteries and implications raised after the final chapters were groundbreaking, to say the least. Without spoilers, what Islington did in the epilogue, Ex Uno Plures (Out of One, Many), was nothing short of outstanding. In one chapter, Islington escalated the scintillating novel into something even more extraordinary.My emotional attachment to the characters and events of this book is undeniable.The Will of the Manyby James Islington is a phenomenal achievement. Islington has flourishingly crafted a Roman-inspired science fantasy world with brilliant plotlines that feel believable through the perspective of a talented and flawed main character imbued with a superbly distinct voice. I absolutely loved it. It IS one of the best books I've ever read, and it is also one of the rare books where, upon finishing it, I immediately wanted to reread from the beginning. And I know I will do that when the sequel,The Strength of the Few, is near. The waiting time for the sequel will be one of the worst waiting times I need to endure. How could it not be after the intense and insane culmination of the book? But until then... I will be patient. Audi (Hear). Vide (See). Tace (Be Silent). And readThe Will of the Manyas soon as possible. A new exceptional science fantasy series destined to become a classic is here.The Will of the Manyhas everything I love in an epic science fantasy novel, and many scenes here will become eternal moments in my mind.You can pre-order this book from:Amazon|Blackwells (Free International shipping)Most of the quotes I wanted to use in this review were taken out on Goodreads because I ran out of allowed characters.You can findthisand the rest of my reviews atNovel Notions| I also have aBooktube channelSpecial thanks to my Patrons onPatreonfor giving me extra support towards my passion for reading and reviewing!My Patrons: Alfred, Aliysa, Anastasia, Andrew, Andrew W, Annabeth, Arliss, Barbara, Brad, Cade, Casey, Chris, Diana, Dylan, Edward, Elias, Ellen, Gary, Hamad, Helen, Jenn, Jesse, Jimmy Nutts, Joie, Kristina, Luis, Lufi, Melinda, Meryl, Michael, Michael, Miracle, Nicholas, Radiah, Samuel, Sarah, Sarah, Scott, Shawn, Shawna, Teri, Tori, Tracy, Wendy, Wick, Xero, Yuri, Zoe.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58416952-the-will-of-the-many,The Will of the Many.txt
Uprooted,"This book is underwhelming AS FUCK.I'll probably be damned for saying this but screw sugar-coating. This book makes me so angry.Uprootedis one of those books with a pretty outside look full of sweet promises. Yes, sweet and yet they're EMPTY promises. The book covers scream 'BUY ME NOW OR REGRET IT FOR ALL ETERNITY' and the synopsis is so vague to the point of mystery. It lead me in to having such sky high expectations only later that I have those expectations thrown back into my fucking face.The beginning of the story started out really nicely in a whimsical fairytale sort of way. I thought this will be the next best thing to add into my Favourites shelf. But by the time I reached past 5 - 8% I had already lose my interest and started to wish that I had never, ever bothered with this.How I pretty much sum up the book:ONE STAR to character developments.I cannot stand any of them. Nearly all of them are as flat as a cardboard cutout. None experienced huge break throughs and if they did, it did not show in the book. The characters are none I can connect with and none I could care less about.My biggest pet peeves is thatAgnieszka suffers a huge case of Special Snowflake Syndrome.She's been picked by The Dragon (who isn't an actual dragon or even a shapeshifter, to my disappointment) out of the blue because she has magical powers. Oh and somehow out of other people, she can survive longer in the Woods.""You’ve been inexpressibly lucky,” he [The Dragon/Sarkan] said finally. “And inexpressibly mad, although in your case the two seem to be the same thing.No one has gone into the Wood as deep as you and come out whole:not since—” He halted, and I somehow knew without his saying her name that it was Jaga: that Jaga had walked in the Wood, and come out again.'*exasperated sigh*ONE STAR to the ridiculous magic system.Not only is it ridiculous but it is FLAWED. This is probably just my personal preference but Magic comes with a price and in this case, once you magick something it only drains you bit by bit. It's hardly any price to pay. Some of the characters in the book are sorcerers/witches and they cast spells to make magic. Magic spells with IMPOSSIBLE ways to pronounce.""Zokinen valisu, akenezh hinisu, kozhonen valisu.”""Ulozishtus sovjenta, megiot kozhor, ulozishtus megiot,”..... I dont know about you but that all goes 'agskdfsfvslmvdgwddnlkgsljkl' in my head. I refuse to even read the spells properly. I legit have no idea just how Novik expected her readers to read that.ONE STAR for the writingthat is so messy, mediocre and tedious to read. Yes, tedious. It's all tilted to TELLING instead of SHOWING. I also have to endure paragraphs upon paragraphs of useless, unnecessary descriptions. I got so fucking bored I nearly fall dead asleep. There was nothing spectacular about the way Novik writes.ONE STAR to the non-existent chemistrybetween the Dragon and Agnieszka. It was bullshit.ZERO STAR to the love interest.If there's one thing I really hate, it's romance revolving around verbal and physical abuses. I swear, verbal abusing Agnieszka is the only language the Dragon knows how to speak in.First of all, he insulted her appearances.""The dirtiest thing in this tower isyou,""he said - true but unkind anyway.annnnd another jab of insult...""I do recall the girl neither horse-faced nor a slovenly mess.""Yes, he just described her as 'horse-faced' to which Agnieszka retorted....""Then you needn't keep me!"" I flared,angry and wounded -horse-facedstung.Yet she still fucking fall for him anyway :-))Oh wait, there's more.The Dragon also insulted her by calling her an idiot every steps of the way.About more than THREE times in the book.More cases of abuse he showed the MC:'He was irritated with me every time I came into his library, even on the few days that I managed to keep myself in good order: as though I were coming to annoy and interrupt him, instead of him tormenting and using me.And when he had finished working his magic through me and left me crumpled on the floor, he would scowl down at me and call me useless'He insulted her plain ways of dressing and forced her to re-dress for HIM in fancy gowns by using magic (which wears out Agnieszka a lot). In the end, she had to crawl on her knees and hands. Yes, he made her CRAWL back up to her own tower, exhausted.Why the fuck would you bother with the way she dressed up herself?Sarkan, you motherfucking creep.He called her intolerable and crazy in one sentence and then he kissed her. This is only the first kiss.""You intolerable lunatic,” he snarled at me, and then he caught my face between his hands and kissed me.AWWW. ISN'T THAT JUST SO SWEET, AND SO FUCKING ROMANTIC?!?!?! WOW. I THINK I JUST DIED FROM SWOONING MY SOCKS OFF OVER THIS INSUFFERABLE JACKASS.The sex scene between them both happened out of nowhere and it was sooooo fucking unnecessary. It was like the book decided to throw in a little spice to their almost non-existent relationship. I got so baffled that Agnieszka would throw away her maidenhood over Sarkan whose behaviour do not even fucking improve afterwards.The fact that many gushed over The Dragon disturbed me. This dude is abusive.ABUSE IS NOT ROMANTIC.Verbal or physical otherwise. STOP THIS SHIT, AUTHORS. Place yourself in Agnieszka's shoes. Put more imaginations on how YOU would feel if you were being treated like all those ways I pointed out.This one treatment to Agnieszka is particularly the most terrible Sarkan had pulled out of his sleeve.'He was on me in an instant, thrusting me flat down against my pillows. ""So,"" he said, silkily, his hand pressed down upon my collarbone, pinning me easily to the bed . . . I was terrified . . . He shoved me hard against the bed and bent low.""Don't dare lie to me!"" he hissed. ""I will tear the truth out of your throat-"" his fingers were resting on my neck; his leg was on the bed, between mine.'How about you go fuck yourself, Sarkan?20 August 2020I wrote this review 5 years ago at the age of 17. I don't think my opinion of this book has ever changed. I still do maintain my stance as to why I thoroughly disliked reading this book, but now that I'm at a much older age than I was before, I'd like to give a disclaimer to not let the extreme profanities my 17-year-old self had wrote to translate through your opinion of the story, characters, etc.I do plan to edit this review some time later in the near future (hopefully whenever I get into the critical reviewing headspace) rewriting it into a more coherent and concise review. But for now, I'll just leave this little note.Stay safe during this pandemic, everyone. Keep reading magical stuffs.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22544764-uprooted,Uprooted.txt
Vespertine,"4.5/5 starsArtemisia is a young woman whose hands are covered in scars. She lives with the Gray Sisters, devotees to the goddess named the Gray Lady, living day by day the tasks of a novice. Like all the Gray Sisters, she possesses the sight, the ability to see the numerous types of undead spirits. But then a confessor named Leandor comes to the convent, searching for a very specific girl. Aretmisia turns out to be that girl and against her will, Leandor tries to take her away. An attack by soldiers possessed by spirits throws a wrench into everyone's plans. During the attack, Artemisia travels to the convent's crypt to keep the relic of Saint Eugenia safe--but something else goes wrong. The revenant, an all-powerful undead spirit confined to the relic takes possession of Artemisia but is able to defeat the possessed soldiers. From there, Artemisia is thrown into a world of even more spirits, wondering what the Lady has in store for her, and a volatile relationship with the revenant. She must defeat the amassing undead before she exhausts herself to death, or something worse happens.Inspired by one of my favorite subject matters, medieval nuns, and containing echoes ofThe Locked Tombseries,Vespertineis a refreshing drop in the otherwise predictable and unremarkable lake of YA fantasy. There is so much to love here from the prose, to Artemisia's character arc, and to how Margaret Rogerson handles certain themes. Rogerson has really done her research here regarding nuns and the lives and activities of medieval women saints and handles the subject matter seriously and maturely. What I appreciated the most aboutVespertineis how differently it handles the issues of faith and religion, not only from other YA fantasy, but from other fantasy books covering the topic in general. In a lot (but certainly not all) of recent books, it's usually discovered that the god(s), or whatever the central figure of worship is, aren't there and the whole religion is a lie. I understand why this is done, but it gets predictable quite quick. While some of the religious authorities of figures inVespertinehave suspicious goals and motives and Artemisia even questions if her prayers will reach the Lady though she does believe in her, Rogerson avoids most of these tropes. She takes the religion and Artemisia's concerns and doubts seriously. There is a nuance and no beating over of your head.Speaking of avoiding of tropes and stereotypes, I praise Rogerson for avoiding so many of the YA clichés with Artemisia. In the beginning, Artemisia is a somewhat cold and closed off figure. Some of the other girls are afraid of her because of both her attitude and of the reasons she came to the convent in the first place. Artemisia doesn't put much faith in a lot of people and she's a bit of a grump, but Rogerson avoids the ""Not like the other girls"" and ""girlboss"" pitfalls. Artemisia doesn't think she's better than the other girls, nor anyone else, nor does she feel herself entirely and overtly special despite being possessed by the revenant and endowed with its powers. She is a loner and tries to act this way throughout the majority of the book and thinks nobody can do anything to help her, but Marguerite, another girl from the convent, calls her out on this.Thank you, Rogerson, for being the exception not the rule.The most interesting part about Artemisia is how closely she resembles actual medieval holy women and saints, particularly with regards to her own denial as to being a saint and how she treats her body through the book. Many real-life medieval holy women and saints did not come forward to their confessors or other Church officials with their visions or miracles because they feared as being branded as heretics, witches, fakers, or even insane. The ecclesiastical process for determining whether one was actually experiencing visions from God and having miraculous abilities--especially for women--was a long and arduous one. Not everyone who came forward, whether willingly or unwillingly, was exalted as a holy person. Artemisia's denial seems to extend from her reluctance to engage with other people and her fear of the power of the undead. Also like Artemisia, many medieval holy women and saints often neglected their bodies. They often starved themselves or beat themselves to atone for their own sins and/or the sins of the world. Artemisia is often indifferent to the exhaustion and scars her body receives; it possibly extends from when the fire spirit first burned her hands a child, but also because she believes there are more important matters at hand.Artemisia denies her sainthood, though most saints did too. In fact, there is a subtext peppered throughout the book about how the Lady often chooses and moves people who don't want to do Her tasks to begin with but have to anyway. Through these themes and concerns, Artemisia's arc is one of gradual and genuine change that is done very well. She has changed somewhat from who she is in the beginning and has the potential to change even more. I am very satisfied with it all. Special attention deserves to be focused on Artemisia's desire for self-sacrifice. Her reasons for it feel legitimate and her dedication for it, if it should happen, are not anything I've ever seen in a YA book before. Usually self-sacrifice is avoided because an author believes it shouldn't happen or it because it skirts too closely to being religious (usually depends on how the situation is presented honestly). However, when you really think about it, Artemisia's desire for self-sacrifice comes form an altruistic place, To echo my friend carol., when it's done for greater good self-sacrifice can be portrayed well.The magic system regarding the order of spirits and how they work is solid to me. There's a few confusing points at times though, but nothing that prevented me from enjoying the rest of the story. The world-building is even more solid; Rogerson is able to describe ecclesiastical politics of the world and what the world looks like without info-dumping and in readable prose. The prose in general is amazing! It's pretty without being too pretentious and is still able to be approachable to YA audiences, in my opinion at least. It definitely feels like genuine fantasy prose, but I couldn't help but feel a Gothic-esque tone to it all.The pacing is a bit slow in the beginning, but it picks up as it goes on. Again, the prose really aids here. I don't recall much info-dumping, or at least it isn't very heavy. I also enjoyed most of the other characters, particularly the revenant. The revenant was one of the sassiest undead spirits I have ever had the pleasure of encountering. It made a great foil to Artemisia and it changed too over the course of the book. Like Artemisia, the revenant has a hidden side to it that comes to the surface over the course of the novel. I genuinely cared for the both of them.I am happy with what happened in this book and how it was portrayed. It feels like an actual story and that things were accomplished in this book. Apparently, Rogerson is writing a sequel so I am interested to see where Artemisia and the revenant will go from here.This was such a hidden gem among YA fantasy. I've heardRaybeareris like this as well, I can't wait to get to it.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56980403-vespertine,Vespertine.txt
Babel,"“Babel, Or the Necessity of Trauma Porn”I can talk about the many problems I had with this book in terms of its length, its structure, its utterly paper-thin characters, and how goddamnedcondescendingit is, and you can find that discussion below. But I feel that I should start with the part of this book that broke me.There’s a concept often floated around when people talk about how to portray bigotry and prejudice in fiction, and it’s the concept that in portraying racist (or queerphobic, ableist, etc.) violence, authors should take care not to do so in a way that is traumatic to the audience who might share that identity. Otherwise, such a portrayal begins to feel like trauma porn for the majority, not an empowering or cathartic narrative for the marginalized.Babelfeels like trauma porn. It is an unceasing stream of racism and racist violence against its characters of color.Kuang’s commitment to showing racism is so intense that she even throws consistency out the window for the sake of it. In one chapter, Robin is described as having the same eye shape as his white father. Inliterally the next chapter, he’s made fun of for having narrow East Asian eyes.Kuang. What is the truth here? They can’tbothbe correct.I’m 100% sure the rejoinder here would be “well, the racism is historically accurate.” I haven’t studied this time period, so I’m not going to engage in any discussions about historical accuracy. But I will point out that “historical accuracy” is not an unassailable argument because historical accounts are never neutral, because the writer chose what to record and what to omit. And—aside from the fact that this book is historicalfantasy, anyways—any work of fiction is composed of a series of intentional choices on the part of the author.(Tangentially, I would also like to point out that RF Kuang has no experiences with anti-Blackness or the racism a brown Indian Muslim would face, so I’m not sure what gives her the confidence to delve so deeply into those descriptions.)So I ask: What is the purpose of this book? The people who don’t understand that Racism Is Bad are not going to be reading this book. The people who already agree that racism and colonization are bad are just going to have this message beaten into their heads by RF Kuang’s literary equivalent of a sledgehammer, because RF Kuang treats her audience as idiots who are incapable of understanding anything for themselves.I’m speaking as an Asian American who does not usually consider anti-Asian racism a personal trigger. I’m speaking as someone who has loved plenty of books that have racism as their central theme:Ace of Spadesby Faridah Abike-Iyimide,Legendbornby Tracy Deonn,Disorientationby Elaine Hsieh Chou.But I foundBabelsimply too exhausting and too depressing to read past the 55% mark. After reading “Chinese people are inherently dirty and lazy and inferior” for the dozenth time, I did not feel enlightened or filled with righteous anger against anti-Asian racism.I felt that RF Kuang had done the literary equivalent of beating me black and blue with a hammer, and I gave up, because my mental health is worth far more than this book.*I have plenty of criticisms ofBabelon a craft level, enough that I’m honestly astonished that it has been so well received when it, in many ways, feels like a massive step back from The Poppy War trilogy.Longer is not always better; or, the pacing of this book was all over the place and the characters are flatter than paper cutouts.Fantasy authors who have just written their first book are discouraged from throwing every single cool idea they have into one manuscript and ending up with a 200K+ word behemoth that they swear they cannot cut down. “Kill your darlings,” and all that. But despite not being a debut,Babelfeels so excessively long and self-indulgent. It felt like Kuang showing off every 1830s reference she could possibly cram into the book to shove her research in the reader’s face. Kuang crams in references to historical events and narrates them with the style of the driest history textbook imaginable. This book was just soexhausting, not just to read, but even to listen to on audiobook (despite the narrator’s fantastic performance).Simultaneously, none of the length is spent on what actuallymatters. The characters are so one-dimensional, as if they mainly exist as canvases for racist violence to be done to them (or for spouting racism, in the case of Letty). Robin doesn’t have any emotional reaction to meeting another Chinese person for the first time in six years—someone who is also hisfamily member—for example.In general, I don’t understand why Robin Swift was the protagonist of this book. He had virtually no personality; he feels more like a puppet than a real person. The motivations he has for going either with or against the Hermes Society (the group that is opposed to Babel and the British Empire) feel so incredibly weak. He is never given the opportunity to come to the conclusion that Babel is bad on his own; no, he has to betold, after a mereone dayat Oxford, by the Hermes Society that Babel is evil and therefore Robin should join the rebellion. In her haste to make sure the readers all know Racism And Colonization Are Bad, RF Kuang robs Robin of the ability to drive the plot of this book. Instead, he’s swept along by the convictions of others, and his character suffers as a result.This same creative choice also destroys what seemed to be RF Kuang’s original intention: trying to portray academia as an alluring, magical world that students want to be a part of, only to eventually realize its rotten underpinnings. Robin doesn’t have any time to fall in love with Oxford after asingleday (no, I’m not counting the three or so days he spent with Ramy before classes started, because you can’t love academia if you haven’t even taken a single class?) before the Hermes Society comes along and tells him Babel Is Evil.A more compelling narrative choice would have been to have the Hermes Society prompt Robin to investigate Babel and come to the realization himself that the institution he loves is supported by colonization and racism—which also would have given Robin some sorely needed agency and character development. Not to mention it would have added tension and propulsion to the plot, which often feels like it’s plodding along without anything to move it forward other than Robin’s need to graduate, until the Hermes Society pops up again at random. As it is, there is so little tension in this book; RF Kuang never withholds information when she has the chance to remind us that Racism Is Bad.Speaking of Robin, I’m not convinced his representation as a biracial person is all that good. This isn’t my lane, so I don’t want to harp on it too much (and would welcome ownvoices perspectives), but it didn’t strike me as plausible that he could pass both for a white person and for a non-biracial Chinese person.There’s a reason “show don’t tell” is taught to amateur writers; or, the book treats readers as idiots.I absolutelycould not stand how condescending RF Kuang was in this book.From her author’s note at the start, I had a bad feeling. It comes off as aggressive, “don’t you dare question my portrayal of Oxford.” And look, if it had been written as a neutral explanation instead of a manifesto—“Here are the places I deviated from exact history and these are my reasons why”—it would have been fine. Interesting, even.But as it is, it really sets the tone for the rest of the book.There is so. Much. Telling. Kuang doesn’t trust any of her readers to understand what she’s saying; no, she has to follow up with an explicit explanation that This Is Bad. Imagine a movie adaptation of this book showing Robin physically beaten by his guardian and then immediately having a voice-over explaining that this behavior was Abusive And Bad. That’s exactly what RF Kuang does with narration.Because apparently we are all idiots, since none of us have two master’s degrees and a PhD from Yale.(I also have to point out that RF Kuang explaining that she wanted to portray oysters as delicacies inBabel, despite that being historically inaccurate, simply because oysters were a delicacy to her when she was as Oxford, not only smacks of the highest degree of self-centeredness but also makes me question her integrity as a historian. Theinterestingpart about writing historical fiction is trying to understand what is the same and what is different from the modern day, not assuming people lived the same way back then as they do now.)RF Kuang wants us to believe that Robin loves his cohort (Ramy, Letty, and Victoire), but she justtellsus this instead of showing us. The “found family” aspect felt incredibly weak, especially since Letty feels like a stock “racist white girl” stand-in. I could not buy the idea that the four of them viewed each other as family when three of them are people of color and Letty kept saying racist things to the rest of them. I nearly laughed at the part where Letty was supposed to be in love with Ramy, the brown Indian Muslim man who is constantly mad at her for saying things like the British had the right to be in India.Speaking of romance, at least in the first 55% of this book, Robin and Ramy’s relationship is soweak, with absolutely zero chemistry, that I would flat-outforgetthat Robin and Ramy were anything other than classmates for a hundred pages at a time until the book hit me over the head with a scene in neon lightstellingme “these two have Romantic Feelings for each other!” I don’t know if it improves later on, but I am disinclined to ever read a romance by RF Kuang when this one was so poorly written. (And I feel the need to point out that this isn’t the first time RF Kuang has shoved a poorly written gay romance into her books.)(I am once again begging people who are looking for queer romances to read the plenty of queer genre romances, in either traditional or indie publishing.)To quote another review—fuck the footnotes. They were either pieces of information that were critical to the story and therefore should not have even been footnotes, or extraneous pieces of backstory that should have been cut but RF Kuang just could not help herself from making this book as long as possible, or condescending “IN CASE YOU DIDN’T REALIZE, THIS PERSON IS RACIST” diatribes. RF Kuang writes as though she thinks her readers are children who can’t tell that she’s writing purposefully racist dialogue so she needs a footnote to explain.And yet, despite Kuang hammering in most of her messages with a sledgehammer to the reader’s skull, her portrayal of Letty is weirdly ambiguous. Despite the fact that Letty often says racist things (see: her opinion on the British in India above), her friends, who are all people of color, frequently defend her, so…what is the intent here?(I was especially dying when Victoire claimed solidarity with Letty because they were both women, while talking to Ramy,a brown man, and Robin. As if the misogyny experienced by white versus Black women isanythingalike. I’m sorry, but why has no one commented on this?)Superficial complexity, underlying plot holes; or, parts of the plot feels like it came out of a YA dystopian story.The most compelling part of the book, for me, was the fantasy element. Even then, there is a huge plot hole in the story. If silverworking only works for people who can “dream” in multiple languages,youcannotconvince me that both Professor Lovell and Professor Chakravarty, who learned Mandarin as a second language, are capable of dreaming in Mandarin when Griffin (Robin’s half-brother) can’t? If they could both learn Mandarin and become fluent enough to dream in it, why couldn’t they train Griffin to do the same? This is never explained.But the part that killed me the most was everything having to do with the Hermes Society.I cannot get over Robin being told that the Hermes Society has to be so careful because they’ll get tortured to death if Babel ever catches them, blah blah blah, while at the same time Hermes is hiring the literalworstcandidates to help them. Robin and his friends cannot lie to save their lives and get caught stealing from Babel, not once, but multiple times. And yet the Hermes Society was so keen to recruit them?At one point, Robin tells the Hermes Society he’s concerned that Babel’s security measures have been upgraded. Guess how they respond?A) “Oh damn, guess we’re going to have to reassess our plan since none of us want to get caught and tortured to death, like we told you we were afraid of before!”B) “Whatever. Everything will be fine. You’re being overly paranoid, Robin.”If you chose B, you were correct.I’m just. I’m lying on the floor here, staring at the ceiling and questioning my entire view of reality if this is the Adult fantasy that’s being called a “masterpiece.” I’ve seen far less ridiculous Adult fantasy books get ripped to shreds for being “too YA,” yet somehowBabelisn’t?ConclusionI tried, I really did, to reach the ending of this book, because I saw some spoilers in other reviews that I wanted to be able to discuss myself.I don’t agree that translation is inherently an act of violence. And I would have hadplentyto say about most of the characters of color dying in the end, including the two queer men of color.But I couldn’t. Because it’s not worth wasting any more of my time on this.As a work of fiction,Babellacks a compelling narrative due to its poor pacing and unbelievably flat characters. As a work of history,Babelcannot be considered as even anattemptat objectivity. Not when the text and the footnotes feel, as others have pointed out, like RF Kuang is breathing down your neck, telling you exactly what you’re supposed to think about the book instead of being a professor guiding students to form their own conclusions. (And because I have no chill anymore about this book, I’d like to state for the record that there is at least one instance of RF Kuang misconstruing real historical events in order to suit her narrative.)Do you know how much it takes to cancel an author for me personally? An author has to be a TERF or a racist or a queerphobe, basically.And yet, I never want to read an RF Kuang book again.If I wanted to be lectured at, I would go back to college/grad school. Except even most of my professors from law school didn’t treat their students like idiots who were incapable of understanding what they had to say.*mic drop*",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57945316-babel,Babel.txt

Though the first half of the book is slow because of all the world building and characters introduction but the second half had me in a chokehold. Because so many things were happening and all the pain that Max and Tisaanah went through was too much 💔😭“It begins with two souls who find themselves suddenly, utterly alone.”╰┈➤ Read this if you like➛ Amazing world building➛ Thrilling action sequences➛ Power and Magic wielders➛ Strong, resilient and powerful MCs➛ A very slow burn and tender romanceThis book is more about Tisaanah's journey and how she survived in Threll when she was a slave for Esmarisand how she tried to bought her freedom from him and how it led her to realise what her powers are. I hated how he treated her when she always treated Esmaris as her family even though he is the one of those people who were responsible for what happened to her homeland and her family. Later Ti arrived at Ara, a land where no one knew her, a language she never knew, just read in some Ara books.It was beautiful to see her language journey, her power wielding journey and everthing in Ara and how she thrived in Ara all on her own and also with Max's help.Romance is a very small part of this book but it still was mesmerisingly beautiful.“Our bodies asked and answered, ceded to each other, moved with unhindered intuition. Together, we burned.”“It’s easy to die for someone,” I said, “but it is so much more valuable to live. I do not give you permission to fail if I fail. Do you understand me?”When he didn’t answer, I pressed, “Do you understand?”“Yes,” he whispered.I've always loved Carissa's intricate and exquisite writing and her storytelling is incredible. Its just flows that you can't help but read more and more. Also this one is action packed and I enjoyed all those thrilling fighting scenes and they were written so well and perfect intricate details that kept me on edge. The way Carissa described Ti's powers and those butterflies of hers, it was incredible and the last fighting scene of Max and Tisaanah had me crying but it was just 🔥“I was too young to know the truth then. That victory meant another’s defeat, and sometimes our own defeat. That winning meant sacrifices, and sometimes ones that even our own people were not willing to make. That in war, someone always paid.”“Every moment in life was a coin with one dark side and one light. They fell on the ground with one side facing up, but the other always lay beneath it, there, but hidden.”✦ Tisaanah VytezicʻThe daughter of no and all worldsʼA fragmented girl who has no home and no family except a friend Serel in threll and she is determined to set all the slaves free from the cruelty of the world she lived in and where she gave all of herself to the men who never knew how incredible she is. She is intelligent and a badass with relentless determination who always fights for whats better no matter what. I loved her so much and her character development in this was amazingly written. I hope she kills all the people who gave her those battle scars and ahe deserves all the happiness in this world and Max ❤️‍🩹“I never allowed myself to be seen as a threat. There was power in being underestimated.”✦ Maxantarius FarlioneNo matter how handsome and hot he was in the beginning I just couldn't like him then. Because when Nura took Ti to Max for his help he denied and was behaving like a cocky and a self centered asshole. It took me some time to love him but honestly he is the best and tge way he cared for Ti and helped her with everything was just beautiful 💘Also he is the softest and sweetest grumpy MMC Carissa has ever written which made me love him more.He is grumpy, intelligent and strong and loves to being left alone. And the moment I learned about his dark past and what that monster Reshaye made him do that I was sobbing for him. He deserves so much better and I'll protect with everything 🥺“If this wasn’t the end, then I was ready to write a better fucking conclusion this time. Whatever it took.”➙ Tisaanah and Max's RelationshipAt first they both disliked each other so much but the more they spent time together, the more they tried to know each other and they tried to understand their choices and their behaviour. I loved how their friendship developed from a trainer-trainee relationship to friends and then to lovers. They both always helped each other no matter what situation is andMax gave Ti a home. A home she never knew she needed. Everything about them is comfort ❤️‍🩹“Still, I didn’t realize. Not when I agreed to let her into my house, or my mind, or my past. Not even when I realized that every time I was without her, I found myself collecting little stories and oddities to tell her about when I saw her again, like stones that I slipped into my pockets.”“I have nothing else.” And there was no hesitation, no pause, as he stepped closer and said, “You have me.”He tipped my chin with his finger, turning my face toward him, and said it again.“Are you hurt, Tisaanah?”They bantered and teased a lot each other but somehow it was all tender, sweet and comforting. There was palpable tension and forced proximity between them which just made all the slow burn in the end worth it! This is the slowest slow burn so be prepared to be burn with them in the end ❤️‍🔥“I was no longer looking at a woman. I was looking at a fucking goddess. A goddess of death and vengeance and utter, indiscriminate destruction.”“Honestly? I thought he was breathtakingly functional too. He was the most breathtakingly functional thing I had ever seen.”And I loved how slowly their friendship developed into love. It was such a beautiful thing because they never forced their feelings on each other but were just going with the flow until they both realised they were in love. I love them so much 💘“I figured you should have something both beautiful and functional, like you.”He said it so quickly that it almost didn’t register.I whipped my head around to look at him. “Max,” I breathed, touching my heart with exaggerated awe,“you think I’m functional?” A dancing smile glinted in his eyes.“I think,” he said, “that you are breathtakingly functional.”✦ NuraFor me she is the most difficult character to understand and interpret. Like one minute she was cruel and cold and the other she had been so gentle with Ti. She had also helped Max a little before but I still don't like her work tactics and how she is working with Zeryth. Hope we get her redemption arc or something in the next books.✦ SammerinI loved his character so much and how he is caring and helpful to Ti and Max 🥺💘 he is one of the best character in this and Carissa you better not do anything to him or I'll bring chaos 🥰✦ Zeryth AldrisHe can die and rot in hell for all I care. Actually no I want Tisaanah to kill him rot his flesh the way he deserved for what he did to her and Max.✦ ReshayeWhat is it? A presence, a monter or something else?We got no answers but I have a feeling it is going to create much bigger problems in the future especially for Max considering its creepy obsession with him.The ending.No that was a lot and I was so scared for Max and Tisaanah what they had to do 😭 they still have wars to fight and so much more and the upcoming plot is going to be very interesting. I really hope so because Carissa left it such a perfect cliffhanger ending 👀“My name is Tisaanah. I am a free woman and yet still a slave. I am fragments of many things but a whole of only myself. I am a daughter of no worlds, and all worlds. And I am not done yet.”To bestie Krys💗 my best buddy, conspiracy and screaming partner 🫂 you are amazing and I loved reading this book with you sm and making all those murder plans 😌 I'm ready to kill them if you want to!! I'm so excited to continue this series with you and start our fangirling over Max again 🤭💘————————————————————————Guess who is obsessed with Carissa's books?

The Sword of Kaigen,"I have a Booktube channel now! Subscribehere!ARC provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.5 stars from start to finish for this exceptional Japanese-inspired military fantasy standalone.As of this moment,The Sword of Kaigenhas become not only one of the four best self-published books I’ve ever read but alsomy personal number one favorite self-published book.It is a true masterpiece.This is one of those books where I just want to write “Please buy it and read it. It’s fucking amazing!” as my entire review. This book came out of nowhere, and it totally stole my heart. If you’ve been following my reviewing progress, you probably know that I like to keep and show my personal stats and facts on books I’ve read and reviewed. AfterThe Mirror’s Truthby Michael R. Fletcher,We Ride the Stormby Devin Madson, andNever Dieby Rob J. Hayes,The Sword of Kaigenby M.L. Wang became the fourth self-published book that I’ve rated with a full 5 stars.I honestly didn’t expect to love this book that much, but I was madly engrossed by every page. Trust me, you’ll want to pre-order this book right now. I already did; it’s only $0.99 at the moment on Amazon for god sake! (More info on the amazing bonuses that come with the pre-order at the bottom of this review.)“A life of dangerous adventures might seem worth it now, when you are young and seemingly invincible, but one day, you will have children, and you will not want that life for them.”The Sword of Kaigenis M.L. Wang’s first adult high fantasy book, a standalone companion prequel to herTheoniteseries, and this was absolutely incredible. It’s an Eastern Asian (mostly Japanese) inspired military fantasy, and I loved this book deeply from cover to cover. The official blurb on Goodreads and Amazon did a great job explaining the premise of the book without spoiling anything, so please feel free to check there if you want to know more. Let’s begin with what I loved about this book. I’ll start by saying I seriously flipped (or swiped) through this book insanely fast.The Sword of Kaigenis brimming with seductive pacing and it was truly unputdownable. Every moment I wasn’t reading it, I couldn’t stop thinking about what would happen next. From deadly propaganda to non-stop escalating suspense and superb character developments, Wang did a fantastic job in making sure that every chapter has something important happening. No pages were wasted; the book was utterly tension-packed and contained a very endearing cast.“Listen, son… when I was your age, I had to face truths that seemed to break the world. That’s what happens when you come into contact with people who aren’t quite like you. You learn over time that the world isn’t broken. It’s just… got more pieces to it than you thought. They all fit together, just maybe not the way you pictured when you were young.”I’m serious here. I’ve said countless times before that I prioritize characterization over everything else, and a crystal clear talent for characterization has been displayed since the first chapter. The two main characters, Mamoru and Misaki, were extremely well-written; but what amazed me further was how in-depth the characterizations were for EVERY character in this book. The characters are flawed, and none of them stay the same as they were at the beginning of the story.Picture:Mamoruby Tara Spruit (@taratjah)Mamoru’s development in the face of the harsh revelation regarding everything he believed was astounding. Reading about his growth, struggle, and determination in living up to his name (Mamoru is Japanese for ‘protect’) was something I immensely enjoyed. But as much as I loved Mamoru, I have to give my biggest praises to Wang for her stunning achievement in writing Misaki.Picture:Misakiby Tara Spruit (@taratjah)The natural and gradual development in her characterization and relationship with her family compelled me to be heavily invested in her storyline. She has become one of my favorite heroines in fantasy, and I was also thoroughly impressed by the awesome and wholesome female friendship nurtured in this book. The characters in this novel taught me the meaning of facing hardships together, and how crucial family, friendship, love, adulthood, and parenthood are in the face of disaster. These and the terror of war were the main themes ofThe Sword of Kaigen, and they were expertly delivered to the reader with finesse.“I’ve never needed a sword to protect you—to raise you the way your father wanted. Caring for my family meant putting away the fighter, so I did.”The world-building was intricately crafted; the clothing, honorifics, attitudes, older Japanese customs, and languages used were all spot-on. I found the world-building and setting to be quite unique. It’s like an alternate Earth imbued with high fantasy elements rather than a totally new world. Planes and technologies were in the book. The languages that the characters spoke were literally Japanese and Mandarin in our world. I may be wrong here, but the name of the Planet, Duna, may have come from the Indonesian word for ‘planet’: Dunia. Although a different kind of book, this book also serves really well as a rival opposite toThe Poppy Warin world-building. InThe Poppy War, the Nikara Empire (Chinese) was invaded by the Federation of Mugen (Japanese), and the main character there employed fire magic. InThe Sword of Kaigen, the Kaigenese Empire (Japanese) was invaded by the Ranganese (Chinese), and the main character here used water/ice magic. As a Chinese person who devours Japanese culture and media on a daily basis, I’m totally satisfied by the evident amount of research Wang has done for her world-building, and I thank her for it.Picture:Planet Dunaby Charis LokeTo say that this book was thrilling is an understatement. I’m not joking.The Sword of Kaigenis one of the most intense books I’ve ever read. I gritted my teeth, I clenched my fist, and I was constantly breathless. Wang knows how to write catastrophic elemental magic and implement extraordinary heart-hammering scenes very effectively. If you loveThe Poppy War, shonen anime/manga, or elemental magic battles—Avatar: The Last Airbender, for example—you seriously have to read this book. Ice magic, wind magic, blood manipulation, and terrific duels; without writing skills of a certain caliber, the battles in this book could’ve been really frantic and too hard to follow. However, that wasn’t the case with this novel because Wang’s prose was easy and delightful to read. Her prose may not be poetic, but it is vivid, simple, and flows without any obstruction.Picture:The Sword of Kaigenby Felix OrtizFrankly, sometimes it even felt like I was reading Brandon Sanderson’s magical battles, and that’s one of the biggest praises I can ever give to any high fantasy author. Wang provided not only one but two climax sequences inThe Sword of Kaigen; the first one began at approximately 35%, and the second one at the 75% mark of the book. I can say with certainty that both of them were stupendous in quality. Showing the raw and violent power of the magic systems, the calamity that appeared when the bloodline of the gods clashed was bloody destructive. I need to also mention that the book features one of the most memorable duels I’ve ever read in a fantasy novel. Not only was the duel itself magnificent in execution, but it was also so emotionally impactful that it formed unforgettably vivid images in my head.The Sword of Kaigenis a war story, a brutally pulse-pounding one. The great characterizations enhanced the sense of danger and impending loss the characters felt during and after the war. Bad things happen to good people and you WILL feel their palpable pain and tragedy. The piercing blade of ice will stab at your empathy, white snow will turn crimson, the summoning of the Whispering Blade will break your heart, and you will beg for more because you won’t be able to stop reading the book until you’ve reached the satisfying conclusion.“But if I learned one thing from Firebird, it’s that a person’s tragedy doesn’t define them or cancel all the good in their life.”The Sword of Kaigenis an excellent Japanese-inspired military fantasy in all its glory. Written with words sharpened to fatal edges that cut straight to the heart with merciless precision; full of colossal frigid blasts that freeze its suspenseful familial drama and outstanding action scenes into the reader’s memory; emotionally demonstrating the terrifying truth of the atrocity of a devastating war that left incurable scars to the fictional characters who have become real to me. All of these components combined to make this book my first 5—and 6—out of 5-star read of the year. I’m only five days into January at the time of writing this review, and I already know that this superlative book will not only be in my ‘best books of the year’ list by the end of the year but it will also be listed asone of the best books I’ve ever read. In my list of brilliant and favorite self-published books,The Sword of Kaigenstands tall at the top of the mountain, and I honestly have no idea when or if another self-published novel will steal its rightful spot. Without any shred of doubt, this was a phenomenal read, and I will recommend this glistening jewel of a novel to every adult fantasy reader from now on. If you’re a fan ofThe Poppy War, read it. If you’re a fan of military fantasy, read it. If you’re a fan of high fantasy, read it!“Wholeness, she had learned, was not the absence of pain but the ability to hold it.”Sidenote regarding Pre-Order bonus:This pre-order currently is priced at$0.99and ALL entrants (worldwide) who pre-order will receive cool bonus swag.

The Poppy War,"”Children ceased to be children when you put a sword in their hands. When you taught them to fight a war, then you armed them and put them on the front lines, they were not children anymore. They were soldiers.”This book. I mean…THIS BOOK! *sighs deeply and shakes head*There is so much to be said about “The Poppy War” and I’m afraid I won’t even be able to put at least half of my thoughts into decent sentences. Because after finishing this book about a month ago(A MONTH AGO!!!)I still have troubles to sort out all of my feelings and thoughts.“The Poppy War”is a great book but it tackles a lot of serious topics and I guess that’s the reason why my heart always feels kind of heavy when I think about it. Of course there is a war raging in this book but there happen so many other things that it’s almost impossible not to flinch when you reach those final 40%. Think about every atrocity that’s ever happened and you get a good idea about what you’re going to read in this book. There’s genocide, rape, torture, self-harm… and that’s just me naming a few of the triggers that might come your way.”War doesn’t determine who’s right. War determines who remains.”Let me tell you this: The longer you continue the worse it gets and even though this was masterfully done and I loved the world building and all the characters, there is still this strange undercurrent of heavy sadness and dread. Golyn Niis was so tough to read, I still get goose bumps when I think about it. This chapter was so, so, so, so damn hard to get through and I can’t remember the last time I read a book and felt that way. Maybe I never felt that way reading a book before. At least I can’t remember a single book that actually made me feel like this. I swear my stomach turned and I had troubles to breathe. I was feeling nauseous reading a book! Yes, it was that heavy! Everyone who already read the book will know what I’m talking about and to those who didn’t: It’s really as bad as everyone claims it to be! I got plenty of warnings but nothing prepared me for Golyn Niis!”Amateurs obsess over strategy, Irjah had once told their class. Professionals obsess over logistics.”Still, despite this heavy feeling of uneasiness that always overcomes me when I think about “The Poppy War” this book was definitely worth reading! I loved the fantasy elements and the idea of powers from the gods! Plus I really enjoyed the chapters at Sinegard Academy and the chimei! What I loved the most was the representation of human nature though. I might be alone with this but it’s obvious that R.F. Kuang put a lot of effort into her characters and you could see it in the way they grow, develop and change. Their character arcs were so amazing to follow, I’m in awe! And before I continue to gush about them here, I might as well move to my character section instead. ;-PThe characters:This is my spoilery spoiler section and if you didn’t read the book already you better turn around and leave. If you’re still curious and don’t want to heed my warning you may proceed at your own risk! I mean I warned you, right? ;-PRin:”No – they couldn’t just do this to her. They might think they could sweep her away like rubbish, but she didn’t have to lie down and take it. She had come from nothing. She wasn’t going back to nothing.”Oh gods! Rin! I can’t believe what she did in the end and I can’t wrap my head around the fact that such a sweet and innocent girl could change that much! But it still happened and her descent was so heavy to watch. >_< I guess that’s what happens when you play with fire, quite literally in her case. She got addicted to the power and I’m so damn afraid of what she’s going to do next! I loved her defiance and strength at the beginning of the book, how she wanted to learn and did everything possible to achieve her goal. She was so determined and strong-willed! But then the war began and all those things happened and with every chapter Rin changed! She became something different, she hardened her heart, she lost her moral compass and made decisions that got her deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole! And then she did the unthinkable and I’m not sure if she’ll ever be able to return from that darkness again. T_T The ending broke my heart, for Rin, for the person she could have been for everything sheHADbeen before she came to Sinegard. She’s not the person she used to be and I find myself weeping for everything she lost and for what she became. =(((”She didn’t want to be possessed. She wanted to remain free.””Then I will die on my feet,” she said. “I will die with flames in my hand and fury in my heart.””My god didn’t make me do anything,” she said. “The gods can’t make our choices for us. They can only offer their power, and we can wield it. And I did, and this is what I chose.” She swallowed. “I don’t regret it.””She was sane, she was convinced of it. She was whole. She had lost much, yes, but she still had her own mind. She made her decisions. She chose to accept the Phoenix. She chose to let it invade her mind.”Altan:”We’re the final front,” said Altan. “If we fail, this country’s lost.” He clapped her on the shoulder. “Excited?”Altan broke my heart. At first I had the same impression like everyone else: That he knows what he’s doing, that he’s in control and a perfect student/soldier but the more we got to see from him, the more it became obvious that he’s far from all those things! This boy was broken beyond repair and he hid it so well that no one ever noticed until it was too late! I can’t say that I liked his actions but I could understand why he acted the way he did! He was lashing out at everyone because he was like a wild animal that only saw threats and didn’t know how to react to kindness. Altan was unable to see that not everyone who confronted him wanted to do him harm. Which makes me sad on so many levels. =( That poor, poor boy! To be tortured like this, to get out of it alive, to live with his past and the knowledge that it might happen again. Just to live with everything he went through! To draw breath every day and to continue, to keep on moving! I can’t even begin to comprehend how he must have felt and I can’t put into words how strongly I feel for him. T_T And I don’t want to believe that he’s dead! He can’t be dead! >_<”I don’t know,” he said after a long moment. “I don’t know what I’m doing.””Altan’s fire drew as its source an unending hate. It was a deep, slow burn. She could almost taste it, the venomous intent, the ancient misery, and it horrified her.How could one person hate so much?What had happened to him?Kitay:”One urinating statue for my easily entertained friend.”Rin blushed. “Kitay, I can’t.”“It costs nothing.”“It costs a lot to me,” she said.Kitay placed the statue in her hand. “If you say one more thing about money, I’m leaving you to get lost.”I absolutely adored Kitay! He’s such a good friend and I loved that Rin and he became besties. =) Despite being fortunate enough to be one of the rich kids at Sinegard Academy he still reached out to her and became her friend. I think that’s what I loved about him the most, he didn’t care about titles or money, he just cared about the person and what it could do! Kitay is the living and breathing proof that good people exist and in the end his character was the only one that gave me any hope. Because despite all the things he witnessed and regardless of everything that happened to him, he still had moral values and acted according to them. In a world so harsh and cruel that it changed everyone around him, he still held on to his convictions and I loved him for it! <333”There was a hard glint to his eyes that she had never seen in him before. He looked as if he had aged five years. He looked like his father. He was like a sword that had been sharpened, metal that had been tempered.”Jiang:”I am a mortal who has woken up, and there is power in awareness.”I really don’t know how to feel about Jiang! I actually liked him at the beginning of the book but I was so disappointed by him when it ended. His character was some sort of catalyst and I had the distinct feeling that he could have done more, that he SHOUD HAVE done more! What if he would have taught Rin about her powers? What if he would have allowed her to use them in a safe setting? What if he would have fought alongside them and would have helped her to control the phoenix? He basically left Altan and Rin to their own devices and this set them on the dark path they were descending at the end. How different everything could have gone if Jiang would have watched out for them! =( To drop Altan as his student was the first mistake he made and not to teach Rin properly apparently his last.”Ah. The law.” Jiang sniffed at an unidentified leaf and then tossed it away. “So inconvenient. So irrelevant.”The relationships & ships:Rin & Altan:”She knew what addiction looked like. Opium smokers were yellowed, useless sacks of flesh. They did not fight like Altan did. They did not move like Altan did. They were not perfect, lethal animals of graceful beauty.”Okay, I’m going to say it:I DIDN’T SHIP RIN AND ALTAN!I’m sorry but I just couldn’t! They didn’t have much of a relationship before Rin joined the Cike and once she was a part of them her relationship with Altan was nothing but abusive. He slapped her, hurt her with words, forced her to do things she didn’t want to do and was everything else but supportive. How was I supposed to ship that? I get that Altan was thoroughly broken but he didn’t have to let it out on Rin and as frustrated as he might have been with her, he still had no right to hurt her. So nope, it was clear right from the beginning that he didn’t respect her as much as she respected him and if you ask me those two never had a future. (Not saying that I wouldn’t love for Altan to come back again. I still wouldn’t ship him with Rin though) I’ll never ship those two and I stand by it. Fight me! *lol* ;-P”Hey. Hey.”Cool fingers wrapped around her wrists. Gently, Altan pulled her hands away from her face. She looked up and met his eyes. They were a shade of crimson brighter than poppy petals.“It’s okay,” he said. “I know. I know what it’s like. I’m going to help you.””She had adored an idea of him, an archetype, a version of him that was invulnerable. But now she knew the truth, she knew the realness of Altan and his vulnerabilities and most of all his pain… and still she loved him.”He leaned forward and grasped her face in both hands. She thought for a bizarre moment that he was going to kiss her. He didn’t. He pressed his forehead against hers for a long time. She closed her eyes. She drank in the sensation of her skin against his. She seared it into her memory.”Rin & Nezha:”We aren’t here to be sophisticated. We’re here to fuck people up.”Now that’s a relationship I could appreciate! Yes, Nezha was an ass at the beginning of the book but in contrast to Altan he actually realized his faults and apologized to Rin. I loved how they both grew out of their initial animosity and became friends in the end. And those fighting scenes!! They were pure harmony on the battlefield and anyone who claims differently didn’t read the book! XD Just like Kitay seemed to have become a moral compass for Rin the same could be said for Nezha and I’m sure if he’d been around at the end she wouldn’t have gone down that dark road. >_< Unfortunately Nezha was lost in the toxic mist and seems to be dead. I refuse to believe that he’s gone for good though. I mean he had some serious healing abilities so maybe he survived it and became a prisoner? But then again he most likely would have been with the Mugenese when Rin launched her attack and I don’t know if he would have been able to survive this as well. >_< I really hope Nezha will magically reappear in the second book! =)”But I saved your life. Doesn’t that make us at least a little square?”Square? Square? She had to laugh. “You almost got me expelled!”“And you almost killed me,” he said. That shut her up.“I was scared of you,” Nezha continued. “And I lashed out. I was stupid. I was a spoiled brat. I was a real pain in the ass. I thought I was better than you, and I’m not. I’m sorry.”Altan & Chaghan:”They had come to an understanding, she and Chaghan. They were no longer opposed, vying for Altan’s favor. They were allies, now, bound by the mutual atrocities they had commited.”I’m going to be honest here: I’m such a sucker for Chaghan!!! I love his character!!!! And is it just me or did I actually feel some gay vibes between those two?! Altan and Chaghan definitely had more chemistry than Rin and Altan ever had! *lol* And they didn’t even have all too many scenes together! I got the distinct feeling that something happened when they spent those three days in the valleys and I’m not talking about Altan winning a fight between them, feel me? *wriggles eyebrows* Haha! ;-P Gosh, I really would have loved to find out more about their relationship and this is just one more reason why Altan can’t be dead! I just ship him and Chaghan too much to accept his death! Period! XDConclusion:“The Poppy War”was an amazing and sometimes truly revolting dark tale about a young girl that follows her own path and fights for what she thinks is right. It shows us how people can grow and how their circumstances and perceptions can change them. For better or for worse… This tale isn’t over yet. In fact it just began and I can’t wait to read what’s going to happen next. Let’s continue to hope for the best while we expect the worst, because apparently that’s the only attitude that will get you through this series. ;-)”And she would call the gods to do such terrible things.”",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35068705-the-poppy-war,The Poppy War.txt
The Lies of Locke Lamora,"”Some day, Locke Lamora,” he said, “some day, you’re going to fuck up so magnificently, so ambitiously, so overwhelmingly that the sky will light up and the moons will spin and the gods themselves will shit comets with glee. And I just hope I’m still around to see it.”“Oh please,” said Locke. “It’ll never happen.”Haha! You gotta love Father Chains for his vivid imagination and if you actually read the entire book you might find yourself at a place where you have to agree with him. XDBut I’m getting ahead of myself here so I’ll just start with my general opinion and will try to take it from there. ;-)This book was amazing! I’m the first to admit that it had a rather slow start and that Scott Lynch put a lot of effort into his world building, the more I read on the more I could understand why he was so thorough with his descriptions though. He set the stage, let us see how Locke’s crew operated, gave us a good understanding about their close bond and offered us a brief glimpse at the machinations behind all their elaborate heists. In short: Lynch wrote a brilliant opening to an intriguing series and I can’t wait to read book two.If there are at least half as many twists and unexpected turns as there were in“The Lies of Locke Lamora”I’ll be a more than just happy camper. *lol* I mean seriously, I loved all those characters and their cunning and deceiving ways. XD Throughout the entire book I never knew what to expect and there were about a ton of“Oh, shit!”moments that were shortly followed by“Jeez! NO!”and“What happened now?”exclamations. I confess that some of the happenings and casual revelations actually left me reeling and I found myself saying: “That’s it! That’s exactly what I want to read!” more often than I can count. And boy did the shit hit the fan at the middle of the book. I barely got a second to breathe and I continued to be breathless until the crescendo ended in a grande finale and the curtain eventually fell.Yes, the second half of the book wasTHATintense. *lol*Anyway, enough of musical terms! Let’s go right to the characters! ;-)The Characters:Welcome to Camorr, the city that harbours questionable characters, morally grey individuals and a wide selection of rich nobles that quite literally beg to be robbed and spoiled. If you’re an innocent and clueless noble you better don’t dwell all too long. You might either end up relieved of the weight of your purse or even worse, you might end up being spoiled for the book! This was a fair warning; the rest is up to you. ;-PFather Chains:”There are only three people in life you can never fool – pawnbrokers, whores, and your mother. Since your mother’s dead, I’ve taken her place. Hence, I’m bullshit-proof.”I really loved that guy! His observations and statements were so funny and accurate and boy was he a clever man. I mean he basically invented “The Gentleman Bastards” and made them the crew they are when we first set eyes on them. He might have been harsh to his boys but it was obvious that he only wanted the best for them and I guess in his own way he really cared about them too. I can’t help but wonder what happened to him though. We only read about him in flashbacks and memories so it’s kind of self-explanatory that he’s dead. How exactly he died was never mentioned though. Maybe this mystery will be solved in book two and we’ll find out more about Sabetha too?? She’s still such a mystery. XDLocke Lamora:”You’re one third bad intentions, one third pure avarice, and one eight sawdust. What’s left, I’ll credit, must be brains.”JThat’s Jean’s description of Locke and to some degree I have to agree with his words. *lol* I think Locke is definitely a whole lot more brains than he gave him credit for though. I really loved this character! He might be a thief but he was a gentleman too and he had his heart at the right place which is the most important thing. For Locke it never was about the money, it was all about the fun he had with his heists and brothers. You might say it was the scheming and plotting that made him happy. To create a plan and to actually execute it in the end. The money they gained from it was just secondary. Locke’s character arc was really intriguing because at the beginning it’s all about the heist and the fun, but the moment the Grey King appears everything changes and gets dark. Well, and after the Grey King took away the only thing he ever cared about his heart and mind are set on vengeance and vengeance alone. I’ve to admit that I loved that angry Locke too and the more I read about his complex character the more I loved him.”If he was going to save them, he had to play the Grey King until the Capa was finished with him, and then he would pray for a quick and easy death. Let Locke Lamora just vanish one night; let his friends slip away to whatever better fate awaited them.””I will have the Grey King, and if all the powers of Camorr and Karthain and Hell itself oppose me, it will be nothing – nothing but a longer trail of corpses between me and your master.”Jean Tannen:”Hell yes,” cried Bug. “I knew there was a reason I let you lead this gang!”“Well, I can’t argue with the manifest wisdom of the boy that jumps off temple roofs. But I trust my points are noted,” said Jean.“Very noted,” said Locke. “Received, recognised, and duly considered with the utmost gravity. Sealed, notarised, and firmly imprinted upon my rational essence.”I loved the bond between Jean and Locke! I don’t know how it happened that they got so close but it was obvious that they are like family to each other. After reading the entire book I have the feeling that I still don’t know Jean all too well but I’m pretty sure Scott Lynch had his reasons to keep his character vague. Maybe we’ll read more about him in the next book and I’d be totally fine with this. Alone the fact that he’s quite literally Locke’s “hatchet man” was enough to make me curious and I truly hope my curiosity will be sated in the next book. =)”I don’t have to fight or run,” he crackled. “I changed the rules of the game. I just have to keep you here … asshole. Here … until … Jean gets back.”The Sanza Twins:”If you do end up in danger, Locke,” said Calo, “you must understand that we will ignore the orders of our garrista, and we’ll bludgeon our friend on the back of his thick skull and smuggle him out of Camorr in a box. I have just the bludgeon for the job.”“And I have a box,” said Galdo. “Been hoping for an excuse to use it for years, really.”Those two were so amazing! They grew on me so fast and then the ending happened and I was likeNOOOOOOO!!!It’s so rare to read about twins in books and I really would have loved to see more of them. Unfortunately it seems like Scott Lynch had other plans and the funny Sanza twins had to disappear. T_T I loved that they would have done everything in order to save Locke and I know he loved them very much. =( I swear I cried real tears when he found them dead at the temple. It broke my heart… They would have deserved so much better than that. Locke was true to his word though, he really made them and Bug the biggest death offering Camorr ever saw and I love him even more for it! <3”And I had to get rid of the moustache in a hurry,” said Locke.“And damned if he didn’t scream when Jean did the honours,” said Calo.“Like a Sanza brother in an empty whorehouse!” Locke made a rude gesture at Calo; Calo mimed aiming and loosing a crossbow at him in return.The Grey King:”But you could have settled for simple theft,” said Locke. “I would have given it all to keep Calo and Galdo and Bug alive. I would have given it all, had you put it to me like that.”“What thief does not fight to hold what he has?”“One that has something better,” said Locke.I really disliked the Grey King and the Bondsmage made my blood boil with anger! They were both such arrogant and self-righteous numpties! I swear when Locke decided to take them down I cheered for him and even though he had to pay a high price for his actions I still think it was worth it. Bug, Calo and Galdo were worth it. I think what shook me the most about the Grey King and his lackey was the simple fact that they just did it because they could. I mean Locke never did them any harm, yet they destroyed his entire life and killed the people he cared about. It was so senseless. The Bondsmage obviously enjoyed to have the power over other people and relished to torture on behalf of the Grey King, so I have absolutely no pity for him. Was it drastic what Locke and Jean did? Yes! Was it wrong? Yes, definitely. Did the Grey King and the Bondsmage deserve it? I’m inclined to say yes, because let’s face it if Locke and Jean wouldn’t have done what they did their lives would have been forfeit the moment the Bondsmage got rid of his shackles. I think they actually didn’t have any other choice if they wanted to survive. >_<The Spider:”I have always found the presumptions of others to be the best possible disguise – haven’t you?”Ha! I knew who the spider was the moment she appeared! It was a clever disguise but not clever enough to fool me. XD I’m just glad that she believed Locke and listened to him and I think they made an interesting pair. What I loved the most about their interactions was their mutual respect though. They could appreciate the skill of each other even though they lived in totally different worlds and were enemies. It was nice to see that Locke’s opponent was as cunning and artful as he was and it gave the story a really nice touch. Whilst the Grey King was all brutality and cruel force in the end, the spider remained conniving and prudent and I really liked that about her.Conclusion:This plane might have taken quite a while until it took off, but boy, did it take off in the end! The more I think about it the more I have to admit that this story was brilliantly executed and I can only take a bow and congratulate Scott Lynch for writing such a complex, detailed and elaborate book! =)____________________________________It’s another month and since March just started I’m once again trying to reduce my TBR with my own blog meme“Hugs’n’kisses OR Dismissed by the Missus/Messrs”.This time around I chose“The Lies of Locke Lamora”and I’m so happy I’m finally going to read this book.I wanted to read it for ages but never had the time and now that I did my monthly blog meme I have no other choice than to go through with it – Which, truth be told, is awesome! *lol*An infamous thief, his morally gray gang and a dangerous and bloody coup?Say no more, because I’m so here for this! ;-P",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29588376-the-lies-of-locke-lamora,The Lies of Locke Lamora.txt
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone,"It's Always Great, Coming back Home..There's a reason us, the Fans, feel that we're connected, no matter where we from, different culture, ethics, ages..we're all graduated from there....Hogwarts.. even like we were in same class,classmates, no matter which edition we read....Cause Harry Potter is not just a story..it's a Life..The Boy WhoSavedFlourished the Book IndustryIt's One of the most important novels in modern history, Sorry, it'sThe Most Important ONE.This Review also for those who hate the series !Please bear with me..Without it, most Book stores & publishers may have the same fate of Video Stores like Blockbuster LLC, which, despite being super popular in the 90s, closed all the stores by 2013, shutting down forever.Yes, without this Novel, and with the rapid change in technology, the ease of making e-books and reading it in PCs, Smartphones, Tablets..etc, the publishing and trade of new paper books may decrease rapidly.It'd be limited for religious or educating books, classics, small novels. Even those could be just electronic too, and the Books be just like Good Ol' Video Tapes.A Dystopia, right? very gloomy idea to the world without This novel,The One.Well, in the case you think I'm exaggerate..Let's have,ABrief !!History of Literature in the 90s-------------------------------Well, let’s back to early 90s , where TV is in every house, even in every room, Video sets are there too, rental video stores everywhere, satellite receivers and cable channels growing fast packed with channels for kids & teenagers, making them attached more & more into screens,not to mention Video Games, Game boy and Nintendo…Those of this new generation who read are “weirdos"" or ""nerds” to the rest of their peers.And for those “few who read”, book stores mostly got for them comics and graphic novels, which most of them created early this century.Classic Novels, they read just for Schools and Classes mostly.And New Novels that make Best Seller are the ones made, or will be made, into movies for Julia Roberts, Tom Cruse or any of the 90s Hollywood celebrity, or the ones by Stephen King because ,of course, will be made into movies too.Even these new novels didn't live up the selling numbers of Tolkien, Charles Dickens, Agatha Christie-what’s with the British authors and selling numbers :)?-, also in Russia no more Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, no more Hugo in France, inEgyptno more like Naguib Mahfouz & the great authors of the 50s to 70s..No new Big Hit for novels, most of the selling books are those of Speculation about strange & mysterious things in the world or in religion, Dream interpretation , cocking books or celebrities rumors.While in US & UK, Top Selling books mostly the Self Help ones, or those teaching Computers Programming and Web Sites-this brand new huge technology leap back then-No new novels to attract the new generation of kids and teenagers, There's few Successful Highlights though, like R.L.Stine’s Goosepumbs in 1992 which made a very good success, and translated in many countries including Egypt.And in Egypt there’s also a very successful project by respectful Publishing house that made “Pocket Novels” for youth, by brilliant Egyptian writers presenting huge variety of novels of many genres, Sci-Fi, Action Thriller, comics, Romance .etc.There’s also “Reading for All”, project by the first lady “Susan Mubarak”, reprinting a huge verity of important books and novels from all over the world in very cheap prices.But all these effort didn't attract “more and more” of new youth readers as intended, it just made more and more books for those few who already reads.The vast numbers of those who don’t just read will increase if there isn't a BIG new attractiveReading Experienceto get them into reading, specially with the more channels, more movies.But the BIGGEST Obstacle for them to read came out in1994, and became a real phenomenon by 1995....it’sPlaystation, The giant Japanese Gaming leap..Football, Crash, Pepsi man, even the comics heroes also have their games, so why reading Superman, Batman’s comics when you can play them..~~~~~~ A beat. ~~~~~~So by 1996, with this growing leap in Gaming, also the Computer 3D games getting much improved, Books get replaced bit by bit by a gaming controls.So do you think it’s wise for publishers to publish a book for new writer?Of course not, it may not even cover it’s publishing cost.So it was very normal when in this year, 1996, whenJoanne, a 31 years old lady from England , handed the manuscript of her first novel to 12 publishing houses, all of them rejected it...A manuscript of over 200 pages of a novel,that she had hard times in her personal and professional life while writing it,and for children??? Seriously is there still any Child left who still read? it’s 1996, the Era of Playstation and Video Games.But then, the Modest“Bloomsbury“agreed to publish it , with 2 advises for her, first that she’d get a day job, since it’s a little chance of making money in children's books.- later she received a grant from the Scottish Arts Council to help her continuing writing.-But the significant advice was to change her pen name cause young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman..So with her name & her grandmother’s ""Kathleen"" come the 2 initial of her pen name..J . k . RowlingAnd in26 June 1997, with 1,000 copies, 500 of which were distributed to libraries, come out in UK, to our World The Greatest..Harry Potter and the Philosopher's StoneAnd Bam!! , everything happened so fast..Before the end of this year the novel was awarded many important literary awards in the UK.An American important publisher, Scholastic, won the rights to publish the novel in US, with a huge check Rowling would never dreams of.Just with small change, 'Philosopher's Stone' to be 'Sorcerer's Stone', as the American publisher feared 'Philosopher's' may not be that attractive to young readers..And Thanks to Harry Potter, now Every young readers worldwide know much more about Philosopher's Stone's legend.In1998Book Two released in UK ,1999in US, winning more literary prizes. And becoming NO.1 Top Selling Book in UK , US and many other countries which start to publish the translated first book.And on8 July 1999, TheFirst Breaking Recordmade when Book Three sold68.000 copiesin just three days after its release in the United Kingdom.. and more copies when it released late 1999 in US..With the fast growing popularity of Harry Potter among readers, more records had been broken..The 3 books takeover the Top Spot in all charts of Best Selling Books for weeks & months, and it's even still in hardcover editions.This conquer of the Top Spots made some literary magazines & newspapers separate the 'Harry Potter books' selling records from the rest of the top selling books, splitting the lists into 'Children Books' and 'Adult Books' sections, under pressure from other publishers who were eager to see their books given higher ranking.And then it was year 2000 , where everything is about to change ... forever..The Playstation 2 is out there, and even higher leap in Computer Games..But even with this much of temptations, thousands of children, teens and parents gathered in the Midnight of8 July 2000in UK and US at the same day in front of stores, not in front of Cinemas as usual, not electronic stores as Apple storesas happening theses days, But it was in front ofBookstores, for The First time in the Book Stores History, to buy a copy of...Harry Potter and the Goblet of FireAnd They didn't mind to find out that the book is over 700 page, it was even for their pleasure, more than double the size of any of the first 3 novels.. double the thriller, double the fun..Over 3 million copies sold at that day only in the US , a New World Record, totally unexpected one.Huge story, bigger plot , mysterious and very well written.And more literate prizes for Rowling... more translated editions to more than 40 language.And a huge budget for the upcoming first movie of the series, which beautifully visualize the magic of the novel by the faithful producers and the director...and it also made some Cinematic Records back then,but that's not our subject now.~~~~~~ ~~~~~~With the announcement of pushing the publishing date of Book Five to mid. 2003 , and with 2 movies out so far, The Hunger for reading Harry Potter kept on..So, As more readers from this generation start to increase , Publishers and Book Stores start to promote for more books for those readers who are hungry for more..Older Fantasy books , like Lord of the Rings-which was a super successful movie by then too-Narnia , Golden Compass and many other novels start getting more reprinted editions. And so Book Stores prosperity increased as it get more and more readers.More countries welcomed the Harry Potter phenomenon.. The English edition AND the local translated ones , both been sold everywhere worldwide.Even inEgyptEnglish edition sold at many books stores. And, hopefully, some New Book Stores specialized in English novels and books start to open in Cairo & Alexandria by 2002-2003..And in summer 2002, after the Movie wild success, Nahdet Masr publishing house got the rights and published the Arabic edition.Although it cut some of the lines for length issues, the edition still hold the magic of it ..making a very good sales.~~~~~~ ~~~~~~The good news is, the literary movement didn't stop there, Harry Potter and Reprinted Classics. No , there's more new books come out for the increasing demand from the readers..By2002,Life of Pi, Man Booker winner make very good sales numbers.And inApril 2003Dan Brown(previously published 3 novels, making good sales)released a novel that made Huge Fuss around and making a new sales records,The Da Vinci Code..The funny thing that there's a reference in this novel that Harry Potter is 'the Second Most Selling Book in History after the Bible', a speculation that happens to be true in less than 5 years after that.A month later,May 2003, Khaled Hosseini released his first novel,The Kate Runnerwhich also made a very good records too.-Don't you agree if there's no Harry Potter before, this Afghan-born author would have a chance? He'd be rejected by 12 publishers like you know who :)-And all that didn't affect the main reason for this new 'Literal Renaissance'.All that didn't affect the Records Breaker to break records one month later..On20 June 2003book Five'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'comes out..Ten thousands of all ages conquer the Book Stores in UK, US and other countries too at the same day to get The One Book they've been waiting for at least 2 years.

From Blood and Ash,"”You’re an absolutely stunning, murderous little creature”.¡Por fin leí el libro que todo el mundo quería que leyera y me recomendaban sin parar! Y de lo único que me arrepiento es de no haberlo leído antes. O sea, ¿cómo pude vivir tanto tiempo sin conocer, sufrir yfangirlearcon la historia de Poppy y de Hawke?Obviamente más adelante haré una sección bastante larga despoilers, pero antes voy a contarles un poco sobre este libro.From Blood and Ashnos cuenta la historia de Poppy, una chica que desde su nacimiento fue elegida por los dioses para ser laMaideny, eventualmente, cumplir con un destino muy importante. Al ser laMaiden, la vida de Poppy ha estado siempre llena de prohibiciones: solo puede vestir de blanco, debe llevar un velo sobre su rostro todo el tiempo, solo unas cuantas personas tienen permitido verla y, obviamente, como su título lo indica, debe permanecer casta y pura como una doncella. Sin embargo, Poppy nunca ha sido muy buena siguiendo las reglas y siempre se ha dejado llevar por su curiosidad. Una noche, se escapa del palacio y termina en un establecimiento bastante peculiar llamado laRed Pearly allí, enmascarada, conoce a Hawke, un guardia que la obligará a replantearse todo lo que su existencia misma comoMaidenimplica.Y creo que no les puedo contar mucho más, pero sepan queFrom Blood and Ashes un libro que, a pesar de que tiene un inicio algo lento, engancha y es imposible dejar de leerlo. Debo admitir que no fue sino hasta el final que entendí el sistema político y religioso que nos planteaban en la trama. Y, en el fondo, creo que ese es el punto de la autora porque, como todo lo vivimos desde los ojos de Poppy y ciertos rituales y procedimientos los mantienen secretos incluso para ella, tiene sentido que nosotros como lectores tampoco los entendamos en un primer momento.¿Y qué más puedo decirles sinspoilers? Hmm… Vale, sin decir nombres, las criaturas que idea Jennifer L. Armentrout para este libro, a pesar de compartir varias características con algunas de las más clásicas, me parecieron bastante originales, pero ya las mencionaré más adelante. Y nada, lo último que mencionaré antes de poder hablar libremente es que LA TENSIÓN de este libro es de otro mundo. Vamos, que todo se siente tan prohibido y lleno de primeras experiencias que… wow, de verdad. En fin, necesito poderfangirlearya mismo, así que empieza la sección despoilers. ¡Están avisados!◘ ◘ ◘1.	Pues el libro empieza fuerte porque Poppy se ha escapado y termina en laRed Pearl, una taberna/burdel, aunque nadie puede reconocerla porque va con una máscara y una túnica. Básicamente, ella está harta de que controlen cada aspecto de su vida comoMaideny quiere realmente vivir, experimentar cosas. La cosa es que de repente ve a Vikter, uno de sus guardias, e intenta esconderse en una de las habitaciones… pero allí se encuentra con Hawke, otro guardia al que ella ha visto entrenar porque le parece obscenamente guapo.2.	Y es que, a pesar de la sorpresa, Hawke no la echa de allí, sino todo lo contrario. Le dice que ni siquiera tienen que hablar y se quita su camisa. Y POPPY SE QUEDA CON CARA DE”OMG, LOS DIOSES MISMOS ESCULPIERON ESE PECHO”.3.	Después de momentos muy tensionantes, SE BESAN. O sea, cuando les digo que el libro empieza fuerte es porque de verdad sucede. ¡Yo nunca me esperé que eso pasara en las primeras veinte páginas!I mean, sí, en ese momento son desconocidos. Pero no me importaba. Y todo es tremendamente intenso, Poppy está flipando y luego Hawke le pregunta que si es su primer beso (QUE OBVIO LO ES PORQUEMAIDEN), pero ella lo niega.4.	Y ES QUE NO SOLO SE BESAN, sino que Hawke baja un poco más y es muy atento con susbobos, digámoslo así. Pero cuando todo va a escalar un poco más, alguien los interrumpe. Hawke tiene que ir a lidiar con algo, pero le pide a Poppy (aunque obvio no sabe quién es en ese momento) que lo espere. PERO ELLA SE VA.Godsdammit!5.	Debo decir que amé desde el primer momento que Hawke le dijera a Poppy “Princess”.6.	Nos saltamos como 80 páginas, pero lo importante aquí es que una de lasLadies in Waitfue asesinada en el palacio y creen que una de las criaturas llamadasCravenla mató porque la encontraron sin una gota de sangre en su cuerpo. Y lo otro importante que ha sucedido es que, en una salida a los jardines, otras criaturas atacaron a Poppy y a Rylan, su guardia, y el pobre hombre murió por una flecha que cargaba el mensaje delDark One, que es aparentemente un príncipe al que apoyan losDescentersy que quiere acabar con la monarquía actual. Todo es un poco lío, pero poco a poco el libro va haciendo que entendamos todas estas tramas políticas, religiosas y de criaturas extrañas.7.	Y es que yo en este punto, cuando ya casi llegaba a la página 160, me estaba preguntando si a Hawke se lo había tragado elBlood Foresto algo, pero ¡por fin vuelve a aparecer! Están en el funeral de Rylan y Vikter, el otro guardia de Poppy, debe ir a encender la pira, pero no quiere alejarse de ella por el peligro. Sin embargo, de repente suena una voz que dice que él la cuidará… Y ESA VOZ ES DE HAWKE. Y obvio Poppy entra en pánico porque cree que la va a reconocer, pero aparentemente no lo hace. Aunque la tensión… ay, la tensión que igual se siente es espectacular.8.	¡Y casi me muero deasjdknaslkdjfnascuando Hawke, incluso a pesar del velo, ve que Poppy tiene la cara algo golpeada por el ataque de los jardines y le dice que eso nunca va a suceder de nuevo bajo su guardia. Lo amo. Fan.9.	Uhhh, bueno, hay algo muy cabrón en todo este libro y es que, cuando era pequeña, Poppy sobrevivió a un ataque deCravens. Sus padres murieron en ese ataque, pero ella lo logró… excepto por un montón de cicatrices que tiene en su cuerpo y, sobre todo, en uno de los lados de su cara. La cosa aquí es que el Duque de Masadonia, elAscendeddel castillo en el que vive Poppy, siempre la menosprecia y le dice que es una lástima que alguien tan bonita esté mancillada por esas cicatrices tan horrorosas. Total, en un momento están reunidos el Duque, la Duquesa, Hawke, Poppy y más guardias y el tipo vuelve a soltar un comentario de lo horrible que es la mitad de su cara… Y HAWKE DICE QUE NO, QUE LAS DOS MITADES SON IGUAL DE HERMOSAS. ¿Cómo puede ser tan perfecto?Aiuda.10.	¿Fui la única quefangrleócuando Hawke le dice Poppy y no Penellaphe a ella por primera vez? ¡Y ella casi se derrite! Es que, vaya, creo que una de las cosas que más me fascinaron de Hawke es que nunca trata a Poppy únicamente como laMaiden, como un objeto. Literalmente todo el mundo la trata como una cosa que sencillamente hay que mantener pura hasta que llegue el momento de su Ascensión. Pero, joder, esa era otra cosa que me desesperaba… ¿QUÉ CARAJOS ES LA ASCENSIÓN? ¡Porque ni Poppy misma lo sabe! O sea, toda su vida ha cumplido un montón de reglas absurdas para llegar a ese momento de la Ascensión, pero ni siquiera sabe qué va a pasar con ella. Era horrible. Al final del libro lo entendemos, pero uf. La confusión y la frustración eran reales.11.HOLY SHIT!Me dio tanta ira leer esa escena en la que el Duque castiga a Poppy por cualquier gilipollez. De verdad, ese tipo siempre ha tenido cualquier excusa para darle “lecciones” a Poppy… y con “lecciones” me refiero a darle tundas. El malnacido. Y leer ese momento en el que le da siete latigazos con un bastón y le deja destrozada la espalda… joder. LO QUE MÁS ME CABREÓ ES QUE POPPY LO ACEPTA Y SÓLO SE LO CUENTA A TAWNY, SU CRIADA, PERO AGHHH.12.	Vale, algo que no he mencionado y que me FASCINA es que, a pesar de todo, Poppy no es ninguna damisela en apuros. Desobedeciendo las reglas, Vikter le enseñó a defenderse en el combate cuerpo a cuerpo, en el combate con dagas y espadas y en el tiro con arco. ¡Y Poppy es ridículamente buena en todas esas cosas! Y hay un punto en el que hay un ataque deCravensque quieren invadir el castillo y a ella le da igual estar en su ropa de cama, pero se pone una capa y sale con su arco a defender el bastión y a intentar matar a la mayor cantidad de criaturas que pueda. ¡Y AMÉ! ¡En serio es muybadass!13.	Eventualmente Hawke la encuentra y en vez de llevársela rápidamente a su habitación de nuevo para que no le pase nada, él le dice que es absolutamente magnífica. ESTO ERATOO MUCH FOR MY POOR HEART!Y es que, claro, para que no se escape, él la sostiene contra sí mismo Y TODO ESE CONTACTO,OMG, Poppy casi estalla en llamas allí mismo. Amo.14.	¡Y es en ese mismo momento en el que él revela que ya sabe que fue ella con quien estuvo en laRed Pearl!*Inserte aquí a Isa gritando*. Y Poppy dice que solo fueron unos cuantos besos, pero Hawke responde que fue mucho más y que no tiene ningún problema en recordárselo Y. ME. MUERO.15.	Él sigue reteniéndola porque intentó atacarlo con una daga y ella pelea, pero él le dice que a menos que vaya a usar sus manos para cosas diferentes a herirlo (IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, OMG) no la va a soltar. Así que Poppy intenta moverse para zafarse de su agarre, pero sin querer cierta parte… ehh… sensible de ella termina rozándose con cierta parte… sensible de él Y LA POBRE CASI SE MUERE, JAJAJAJA.16.	Okay, tengo que dejar enrecordque siempre sospeché que había algo… más… acerca de Hawke. Todos esos comentarios de “es que suenas más viejo de lo que pareces”, “se movió tan rápido que no pude verlo” y cosas así me dieron pistas desde el principio. Nunca lo adiviné por completo, pero siempre supe que no era “sólo” Hawke.17.	En serio, las conversaciones entre estos dos me iban matando lentamente. Después de la noche del ataque, Hawke y ella están hablando y él le dice que no le va a impedir absolutamente nada, pero que la próxima vez que salga por favor se ponga unas botas y algo diferente a su atuendo de dormir porque verle las piernas desnudas lo iba volviendo absolutamente loco. QUE ALGUIEN ME DÉ AIRE, POR FAVOR.18.	¿Y podemos hablar de nuevo de que Hawke es el único que le hace preguntas a Poppy sobre ella misma y no sobre ella comoMaiden? Es que amo que sea el único que la vea más allá de ese título absurdo que nadie entiende.19.OMG, hay un momento en el que Poppy está en sus sesiones semanales con laPriestess, una vieja súper desagradable, y esta señora intenta pegarle una cachetada a Poppy por alguna “insolencia” que dijo, PERO EL GOLPE NUNCA LLEGA PORQUE HAWKE LA DETIENE. LO AMO.20.Dude, casi me parto de la risa cuando Poppy sale por el castillo hacia la biblioteca con el único objetivo de robarse un diario erótico de una talMiss Colyns… Y resulta que lo empieza a leer y llega a una parte en la que describen cómo están besando a la autora del diario no precisamente en la boca, sino…well… you knowy justo en ese momento llega el Duque ella termina atrapada en el filo de una ventana no pueden pillarla. Total, después de un montón de tiempo, el que la termina encontrando es Hawke. Y para bajarla de esa ventana tiene que abrazarla y de nuevo ella queda como:OH, MY GODS, TODO SU CUERPO ESTÁ TOCANDO EL MÍO Y DEBERÍA DECIRLE QUE ME SUELTE, PERO NO QUIERO PORQUE TODO SE SIENTE MUY BIEN.21.	Y después de muchos momentos de tensión, Hawke le quita el libro y se da cuenta de que estaba leyendo ESE diario y… dioses, casi me muero de la risa de nuevo porque él queda como “vaya, vaya, qué material de lectura tan interesante”. Y LUEGO EMPIEZA A LEERLE APARTES DE UN CAPÍTULO EN VOZ ALTA.22.	Ay, y luego, cuando están en ese Rito, creo, en el que Poppy por primera vez puede ir sin velo y vestida de rojo (y no blanco como siempre), se encuentra con Hawke y le dice que mintió cuando le dijo antes que se veía adorable porque en realidad se ve hermosa y exquisita. Y ELLA MUERE. Y YO TAMBIÉN.23.	Al final, los dos se aburren de ese evento y como Poppy no quiere volver a su habitación, se van hacia los jardines a pasear… Y ESTÁN COGIDOS DE LA MANOOOO. O sea, ya sé que esto no es gran cosa, pero para ella lo es y es precioso. Total, terminan en una especie de lugar subterráneo bajo un árbol y Hawke se sienta en una banca Y LA SIENTA A ELLA ENCIMA DE ÉL. Mientras todo esto pasa, ella está en plan de “oh, no, esto es inapropiado, pero en realidad no quiero dejar de hacerlo” y Hawke le dice que sabe que ella quiere hacer estas cosas y que le gustan.Akajsdhfkasd. Y luego ella le dice que sentarla en su regazo no es nada inocente, entonces él dice que nunca hace nada inocente. Y POPPY RESPONDE QUE ENTONCES DEBERÍAN ESTAR EN SU HABITACIÓN CON UNA CAMA, DIOSES.24.	Y la escena sigue así, llena de tensión y de diálogos hasta que ella dice que es laMaidenY ÉL RESPONDE QUE NO LE IMPORTA. ¡Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Y SIGUEN HABLANDO Y ÉL VUELVE A DECIRLE POPPY. Y ella responde que es la tercera vez que le dice así y que está llevando la cuenta. O SEA, ES UNA IDIOTEZ, PERO YO MORÍ.25.OMG, OMG, OMG, eventualmente él dice que se está haciendo tarde y debería llevarla a su habitación, pero Poppy no quiere volver porque eso implicaría aceptar nuevamente su papel deMaideny, en vez de eso, LE PIDE QUE LA BESE. Y ÉL RESPONDE QUE NO TIENE QUE PEDÍRSELO DOS BESES NI ROGAR Y SE BESAN Y YOAJDSFLKAJDFJAKS. Y obvio todo es re intenso, él la reacomoda para que quede a horcajadas y ENTONCES ELLA PIENSA QUE NI SU VESTIDO NI SUS PANTALONES SON SUFICIENTEMENTE GRUESOS PORQUE SIENTE TODO. Y más adelante él le dice que si no quiere algo, se lo diga (VIVA EL CONSENTIMIENTO), pero siguen y luego él le dice que debe confesar que estuvo a punto de llevarlos al piso y “hacer cosas malas”… Y POPPY DICE QUE NO LO HUBIERA DETENIDO y que eso la hace una malaMaiden, pero Hawke, hermoso, le dice que no es eso, sólo es una chica a la que le piden demasiado por un papel que ni siquiera entienden bien. AMO.26.	Uhhh… y luego cuando están saliendo de ese lugar, Vikter los ve y es SÚPER EVIDENTE que se estuvieron besando porque tienen los labios súper hinchados. Pobres xD. O no.27.HOLY SHIT, cuando Vikter y ella van hacia su habitación y pasan por el lugar donde se estaba celebrando el Rito, VEN QUE ALGUIEN ASESINÓ AL DUQUE Y LO EMPALARON CONTRA LA PARED CON LA VARA CON LA QUE SIEMPRE LE PEGABA A POPPY. ¡Justiciaaaaaaaaa! Aunque, bueno, locreepyes que todo va con un mensaje apoyando alDark One.28.	Luego, todos están reunidos en una habitación y allí está Lord Mazeen, otro cabrón que siempre la maltrataba con el Duque. Y ya ni recuerdo qué le dice a Poppy, pero la cabrea muchísimo y ELLA SE DESATA Y LE CORTA EL BRAZO, LUEGO UNA MANO Y LUEGO LA CABEZA.YOU GO, GIRL!!!!29.	¿Podemos hablar de lo tierno que es que Hawke la cuide mientras está inconsciente y que ella, incluso dormida, sienta la caricia de sus dedos contra su mejilla? Es todo demasiado adorable.30.	Y es que, en serio, yo sé que muchas de las interacciones de Poppy y Hawke no son súper ardientes o lo que quieran, pero entre ellos incluso los más inocentes roces o abrazos tienen un gran significado por lo aislada que siempre ha estado Poppy. Y todo me parece hermoso.31.	¡Oh! Vale, con todo lo que pasó, finalmente la Reina convocó a Poppy a la capital y, por ende, tiene que irse con sus guardias. En un momento Hawke le dice que va a ser súper divertido montar a caballo con ella y le guiña el ojo, pero Poppy no entiende… hasta que efectivamente está encima del caballo con él SÚPER CERCA y sintiendo cada punto de sus cuerpos tocándose,lol.32.	OH, DIOSES DEL OLIMPO. Momentazo a continuación. De camino a la capital, tienen que atravesar elBlood Forest, que está lleno de criaturas yCravensy todo, así que, evidentemente, Poppy no puede dormir y se está muriendo de frío. Entonces Hawke coge varias mantas de sus caballos y se acuesta con ella para darle calor (WE ALL KNOW WHERE THIS IS GOING) y para tranquilizarla. Y al principio sencillamente están acurrucados, ella diciéndole que no va a poder dormir, pero luego Hawke le dice que apuesta a que puede relajarla y hacer que duerma. Así que le pide permiso, Poppy dice que adelante, que lo intente… Y ENTONCESHE STARTS TOUCHING HERE DOWN THERE AND DOING THINGS… ¡Y TODO EN UN CAMPAMENTO CON MÁS GUARDIAS! Y no pueden hacer ningún sonido yholy mother of everything intense. Evidentemente Hawke tiene que taparle la boca al final para no alertar a nadie sobre lo que hacían y luego le dice que van a parar por hoy en ese momento porqueif he gets any part of him inside of her, he’ll want every part of him inside of her and he’ll want to hear every sound she makes… y eso no puede pasar… TODAVÍA.33.	Hay otro momento en el que hay unosCravensatacándolos y, obviamente, Poppy está luchando. Y cuando hay un respiro en la pelea Hawke le dice que nunca pensó que algo relacionado con losCravensle parecería sexy, pero que verla a ella pelear lo pone muchísimo. Dio-ses.34.	Okay, okay, repiremos… De verdad, no sé qué tienen las posadas de los caminos en los libros de fantasía, pero SIEMPRE suceden cosas salseantes allí. Y aquí no es diferente. Una noche, Poppy y Hawke están hablando y ella le está contando sobre su don de sentir el dolor de las personas y su capacidad para aliviarlo. Ella le confiesa que lo ha hecho con él un par de veces y él se lo agradece, pero luego las miradas son súper intensas y Hawke le dice que no debería mirarlo así, que no es digno… Y, justo cuando se va a ir, Poppy le pide que pase la noche con ella. MUÉROMEEEEEEEEEEEE.35.	Él se queda enshocky le dice que no entiende que si se queda, en menos de diez segundos estaría sobre ella… Y Poppy le dice QUE YA LO SABE. Hawke responde que esta vez no solo la besara… Y ELLA LE REPITE QUE LO SABE. POR TODOS LOS DIOSES, QUE SE CALLEN YA. Y entonces ella se desnuda y Hawke la mira como si fuera lo más hermoso de la vida, a pesar de sus cicatrices. Y, algo importante, es que allí revela que una de sus cicatrices de la pierna es por la mordida de unCraven, pero que a diferencia de todo el mundo, ella no se convirtió, sino que sobrevivió normalmente y por eso es la Elegida, laMaiden.SIGUE EN COMENTARIOS",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52831200-from-blood-and-ash,From Blood and Ash.txt
Unsouled,"A foundational start to a series that feels like the beginning of shonen anime in prose form.I’ve promised many readers—my impatient co-bloggers included—that I’m going to readCradleas soon as 2020 starts, and so here I am. I’ve been eyeing this series for quite a while now, it also has been recommended to me more than thirty times by more than thirty different readers. That number is not an exaggeration; I’ve receivedthatmany messages and recommendations from readers around the world telling me to read this series because they knew I’m going to love this series, and they weren’t wrong. I enjoyed readingUnsouled, and I know I’ll be binge-reading this series.Unsouledis the first book out of—if I’m not mistaken, please correct me if I’m wrong—twelve planned books in Will Wight’s highly acclaimedCradleseries. The story follows Wei Shi Lindon, an Unsouled who’s not allowed to learn the sacred arts of his clan due to his deficiency. Due to his misfortune, Lindon has to use and scheme whatever possible means to gain victories over his obstacles. It’s a book that’s filled with resonating themes such as paving your own path, and the willingness to pour in extraordinary hard work to fight against all odds.“When a traveler cannot find a path, sometimes he must make his own.”I love underdog stories; there’s always something satisfying about seeing a character who’s practically shunned by everyone becomes a respected individual.Unsouled—and most likely the entire series—depicts Lindon’s relatively slow but gradual rise to a higher level of power, rising from an underdog and, maybe, eventually becomes the strongest in the world through the progression of the series. Many shonen anime/mangas have utilized this simple premise and expand the premise into something much larger and complex;Narutoby Masashi Kishimoto is a great example of this, and it would be quite difficult for me to believe that Will Wight isn’t inspired byNarutoin the creation of this series.The first book alone already has so many noticeable inspirations fromNaruto, and I’m not speaking exclusively about the premise or the similarity in Lindon’s personality—especially his perseverance and determination—that resembles Naruto and many other shonen anime protagonists, the magic and the Asian-inspired world-building also felt like a homage to it. I mean, it has an intricate magic system that revolves around madra (pretty much chakra inNaruto); Elder that reminded me of the Kages inNaruto; the existence of numbered tailed-beasts (in a form of fox, too!) and also sacred art villages that reminded me of the ninja villages inNaruto. So many aspects, to me, felt like a great homage to the manga/anime and I loved reading about it. Plus, Will Wight has an accessible writing style that flows nicely, felt clean and well-polished.“Fate is not fair, but it is just. Hard work is never in vain…even when it does not achieve what you wished.”Admittedly, there were plenty of sections—particularly in the first half of the book—that felt very info-dumpy to read, and this hurts the pacing considerably. Also, Lindon’s characterizations still require more introspection and internalization in order for me to feel more invested in his journey. If you find yourself struggling through the first half of the book, I strongly recommend you to give the book a chance, at least until the 50% mark. The second half, in my opinion, was better than the first half, and it showed the potential of awesome things to come in the sequels.Despite a few hiccups on the quality of the book as an installment, the good thing about all this is thatUnsouledfelt like a prelude to greatness, a necessary setup for the rest of the series to shine. When I read manga, there’s an incredibly high chance that the first volume won’t spark my interest in the series yet; I usually allow five—in some worse cases, ten to twenty—volumes before I finalized the decision to continue reading the manga series or not. I find this notion to be aptly applicable toUnsouled. IfUnsouledsignified the weakest installment of the series, then I know I’m going to have a blast readingCradle.“The disciple follows the master, but the genius blazes their own trail.”You can order the book from:Book Depository (Free shipping)You can findthisand the rest of my reviews atNovel NotionsSpecial thanks to my Patrons onPatreonfor giving me extra support towards my passion for reading and reviewing!",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30558257-unsouled,Unsouled.txt
A Court of Thorns and Roses,"(Note from 4/17/2023 So someone reported this for unmarked spoilers even tho I prefaced it lol so the spoilers will be marked where they are, even though they really aren't spoilers at all because they do not significantly affect the plot in any way but oh well. It's either do this or have the entire review hidden bc of spoilers)(Note from 2/21/2023 because I apparently have to spell it out: For those of you who don't read comments or check dates read, I read and reviewed this book in 2018. It has been about 5 years; as I have stated in a number of comments, I will not continue this series. In the intervening years since reading this, my feelings on the matter have not changed nor have I desired to continue. Please refrain from commenting about how I need to continue the series or that I did not understand the book. I receive too many of those comments and I'm tired of replying the same thing over and over again. This review is for me first and foremost, not you. Please move on if you do not like my take.)Me to Sarah J Maas:""Do you lie awake at night to come up with all your witty replies for the following day?""Oh dear, this is awful.The WritingThe title of this book is stupid. It's stupid and flashy and unrelated to the actual content of the book. It's solely for the ~wow~ factor. The quotable line, ""I love you... Thorns and all"" is wholely ineffective because ""thorns"" had not been established as a motif and was only used in that context in that very scene, more than halfway through the book. The word ""thorn"" was only used a grand total of 9 times in this book. The original Beauty and the Beast story had established rose motifs—you can't borrow good writing, even for a retelling. That's just lazy.The writing itself was inconsistent and poorly done.I pushed and pulled, but the mud was too slick, and held fast.Are you aware of the definition of ""slick"", Sarah J Maas? I do not think it means what you think it means.Besides that, Amarantha's hair drastically changed color after about 90 pages:Her red-gold hairHer black hairWhich is it, Maas? It can't be both unless she has unmentioned magical hair dyeing abilities.The atmosphere and the opening chapter were excellent and I was intrigued by the idea that was offered me, but the actual book did not deliver at all.This next point is a spoiler, but because I am disgusted with Sarah J Maas for including this, I amnotgoing to mark it as such, since everyone should know what kind of morals this book is supporting before they read it especially when they are as filthy and vulgar as this was.The attemptedrapeof Feyre by Tamlin was brushed off as no more than a mere romantic, steamy encounter to further their lukewarm love story. The only conclusions I can logically draw from this are all rather victim blamey, tbh—she was warned several times to stay inside with the doors locked until dawn, but she leaves her room not once but twice before dawn because she ~wants to go to the party~ and then later, after she almost gets gang-raped and is saved and then creeped out by Rhysand the sociopath, she thinks she is totally safe to go eat a bunch of cookies because, well the drums stopped, so it's probably okay now, and then she getssexually assaultedby Tamlin, who wasstill high with lust magic.I was about to pass out when he grabbed me, so fast I didn't see anything until he had me pinned against the wall.""Let go,"" I said as evenly as I could.I [pushed] him away. He grabbed my hands again and bit my neck. I cried out as his teeth clamped onto the tender spot where my neck met my shoulder. I couldn't move—I couldn't think.Before, during and after theattack, she's thinking,Wow, he's really hot. I'm kinda uncomfortable with this, but I guess it's okay that he's drunk on lust magic, because I wanted to sleep with him anyway. That is avery wrong and dangerous way of thinking.No matter what, it isneverokay foranyoneto make someone else sexually uncomfortable or afraid, especially when they've given verbal disapproval. This entire scene left a bad taste in my mouth.And then there's Rhysand's behavior. He repeatedly violates her personal space and comfort, drugging her and forcing her to""dance""for him in front of a large crowd for weeks on end after stripping her all but naked. Like all Fae males, apparently, he uses brute force to get her to comply with his sexual wishes.""But he didn't actually touch her; he kept his hands just on her waist!"" you say. Yeah, but did she say he could touch her at all? Did she actively encourage him to touch her? No, she did not.I pulled away, but his hands were like shackles.I would not have such an issue with this if Sarah J Maas didn't give the impression that she supports such behavior. That is what I find unconscionable.Besides that, the plot made no sense, even after exposition-Alis gave us the lowdown—in fact, it almost madelesssense then. It was cheesy and cliché and frankly, boring. The ""riddle"" was extremely easy and only proved that Feyre is an absolute idiot with no logical abilities, as I was able to figure it out before Amarantha had even finished saying it, and I'm notoriously bad at riddles.The sex scenes were almost Empire of Storms levels of bad, cringey, and gross. I think Sarah J Maas doesn't know what YA means and isn't aware she's actually writing for NA.The WorldbuildingThe Fae were, for one thing, almost exactly the same (primarily in appearance and personality) to the ones in the Throne of Glass series, and tbh I was disappointed. They're not even cleverly unique faeries. They're just Tolkien-esque elves that are actually vampires: fangs and biting, immortality, aetherial beauty, animalistic tendencies, superiority complex. They don't have any distinct differences from humans in their thought processes or emotional capacities—only the same degree of variety that exists in humans.The religious system and creation story was very interesting and I really liked that aspect.The CharactersFaerie aka Belle: Sarah J Maas decided to try something new and have a first-person fixed perspective, but it didn't really work, because Feyre was a bland complacent character without much substance passed the surface level, and most of the interesting action took place where she couldn't see it. She suffered, like Celaena did in Crown of Midnight, from what I call Nehemia syndrome: the character that the MC has grown to trust, despite obvious suspicious behavior, turns out to be manipulative, and yet the MC completely overlooks that fact in favor of idolization of their lying friend. In this case, everyone in Prythian is keeping secrets from her and after almost getting her questions answered by the Suriel, Feyre decides to ""Stay with the High Lord. He will keep you safe,"" and just completely forgets that she wants answers about the blight. Also, whereas Belle left the Beast in the original story because her father was in mortal danger, in this book, Feyre leaves becauseTamlin impies that she's gonna get ganked by Rhys or Amarantha, the evil Faerie Queen.She is not an active protagonist. Also, her painting skills aren't a part of her characterization; it just feels tacked on to make her ~cool~ and ~unique~Tampon aka the Beast: I don't even care about this guy tbh. He's a confusing character who just feels like a Chaol-Rowan merge on steroids. He's violent, obsessive, and abusive, but also sweet, understanding, and caring, because that's not a contradiction. There's a difference between a complex character and a poorly written character.Lucien aka Lumiere/Cogsworth (his steampunk eye suggests Cogsworth but his personality suggests Lumiere): So apparently he ""hates"" Feyre even though I almost shipped them more since they consistently had better chemistry than her and Tammy, and that's saying a lot, because they didn't have chemistry.exposition-Alis aka Mrs Potts: She was okay. Just okay. She was fine.Reese's Cups aka also the Beast and kinda Gaston too: Is he supposed to be her love interest for the rest of the series or something, because the fan art definitely suggests that, but, uh, did everyone forget that he's a dangeroussociopathwith a history of violence?? He has no regard for her emotional well-being and sees her body as literally nothing beyond a sexual plaything. He's a horrible person.Amarantha: Why did there have to be a ""big bad evil Faerie Queen"" in this at all? There's already one in the Throne of Glass series and I can only take so much female-against-female hate from a supposedly feminist fantasy writer. Amarantha was bland and predictable, and her motivations were extremely surface-level.Her fam: Nesta was like, supposed to have some kind of implied character arc but lol it wasn't very good. Elain was nice and I liked her. The dad was okay, I guess. Pretty forgettable tbhIsaac Hale aka fake-out Gaston: This character wasn't important at all, but I just wanted to say that I think this is the dumbest name choice in a high fantasy book that I've ever seen.Isaac Hale?? Really, Sarah J Maas? Really? That's the Jason of fantasy names. This is a the-guy-who-went-to-high-school-with-my-older-sister kind of name. It's not a fantasy name.ConclusionWhile I managed to read it fairly quickly, I had to dnf it for several days before deciding to trudge through. It was horrendous. I may pick up the sequel at some point, idk, but for now, from what I predict and understand from various spoilers I've encountered on the internet, I don't really care about this series very much. Frankly, it's not good.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50659467-a-court-of-thorns-and-roses,A Court of Thorns and Roses.txt
Kushiel's Dart,"Just a disclaimer here: This will be a very difficult review to write. In order to truly review this book, I have to talk about my own views on things and how books affect me personally. I am opening myself up here, which always makes me squirm. If you are reading this review and you don't agree with my beliefs on things, that's totally fine. But, I am not going to deny how I feel, because that is very important to me when I review a book, since I read books emotionally and not from a detached standpoint. Having said that, let's get this show on the road.I can think of a list of reasons why I should not have liked this book, and I will start there:1. I really dislike long books. As I told a friend on here, I am a 'hit it and quit it' reader--meaning, I like to read shorter to moderate-length (and occasionally longer) books, get them read, and move onto the next book. This book was a massive 901 pages!2. Prostitution and paid sex is something that I absolutely detest the thought of. It squicks me out that someone would pay for sex or have sex for money or financial support/livelihood. I generally avoid this content like the plague, although a big part of my nature is to occasionally challenge myself and my perceptions of the world. It's good for me, even if the process is painful at times. This book has a heroine who is a courtesan, although she is called more ugly terms that I don't use. Not only that, her prostitution is a form of worship and honor to one of her dieties (if you want to call Fallen angels dieties).3. I don't like books where the main characters sleep with a lot of people during the book. Promiscuity and sleeping around is another area that I am just not comfortable with. I especially don't like reading about sex with no love/emotional bond. This book was kind of interesting in that Phedre's sex is a form of worship. She didn't love most of the people she was intimate with, but she loved Elua, Naamah, and Kushiel, and that was expressed through her sex with her patrons. The genesis of the sacred nature of sex in this culture relates to the fact that the angel Naamah would lay with strangers to support Elua and the angels as they traveled through the Terre D'Ange. It's probably necessary to mention that the patron can be male or female. Elua's dictate isLove as thou wilt, which eliminates any stigma to same sex relationships. Although I am more of a male/female romance reader, I don't necessarily dislike same sex interactions, so that wasn't a huge issue for me.4. I am very vanilla about sex. Meaning, I don't like reading about kinky, dark, twisted sex at all. I especially don't like reading about sadomasochistic/painful/humiliating sex. I don't understand that need and it's not something that I personally feel okay about. The main character in this story is a masochist. She was pricked by Kushiel (who is the angel who is the keeper of Hell and punishes the lost). That punishment is out of love to save their souls. Phedre possessing Kushiel's Dart marks one of her dark brown eyes with a dash of red, which is a visible manifestation of her being favored or cursed to have a physiology which made pain pleasurable for her, including emotional pain (which means that she got sexually aroused by being humiliated or forced or treated badly by her partner). I'm not going to go into detail here. I think you could use your imagination. I'll just leave it with two words to express my feelings: Ick Factor! Most of the sex scenes were very uncomfortable for me to read. In the author's defense, this book has very elegant sex scenes (for the subject matter). Somehow, she managed to avoid them coming off as repulsive and tawdry. My repulsion was based on my own comfort zones being exceeded, instead of deliberate acts of prurience on the author's part.5. I typically don't care for stories with a lot of political intrigue and situations. Surprisingly, I found that I really got into that aspect of this story, and I was quite enthralled with the tangled web of conspiracies against members of the royal family and nobles. I believe it was because Ms. Carey did a great job of entwining Phedre into this Gordian Knot in a very intimate manner through her adoptive father, Anafiel Delaunay. Phedre becomes Delaunay's bondservant, and is trained to be a master spy as well as courtesan. Her skills aid him in his secret avocation to the royal family, hearing and seeing all, in the line of her duties as a courtesan.6. The whole cultural set up of this story is very different from what I am used to. Surprisingly, this part was the easiest thing to get past. When I read fantasy, I expect that the author will build her own world from the ground up, and that might include other religious beliefs. It's easier for me if the author founds a whole new religious world divorced from the real world. I can easily separate myself from what I know and accept the concepts from the story and read it with a fresh mind. In this book, Ms. Carey takes a left turn from Christianity, and creates a world in which the main diety worshipped, Elua, is the son of Jesus' blood from when he was wounded on the cross and its union with Mother Earth. The other members of the pantheon are angels that chose to fall to accompany Elua in his exile. In other words, turning their back on God to follow Elua. The people with these beliefs are called D'Angelines, because they live in the country founded by Elua and his Angels called Terre D'Ange (Land of the Angel in French). Christianity still exists in the world, and its practitioners are called Yeshuites, after Jesus' Hebrew name of Yeshua. I believe there are also Muslims, but they are called Akkadians. The people who correspond to the Celts and Picts of Alba (Britain) and Eire (Ireland) have their own beliefs, and the Skaldi, who are like Norsemen, worship the Norse pantheon. Even though it was pretty different, I thought it was a pretty creative cultural genesis that Ms. Carey accomplished in this story.Yes, that's a lot of reasons why I shouldn't have liked this book. Despite these things, I loved this book. It was fascinating. It kept my interest. I cared about the characters. Phedre was a heroine that I loved. I didn't like her assignations, and I would sort of roll my eyes when she took another one, much like Joscelin did. But, I liked her as a person. I could see that she was being true to herself, and I couldn't fault her for that. I loved how she came from very humble origins and made something wonderful of herself. I loved her loyalty and her caring heart. I loved how clever she was. She used every thing she had been taught and all her assets to accomplish what needed to be done. Even though I didn't always like what she did, I respect why she did it. It was profound to see how her view of herself and her place in the world changed. People looked down on her for being a 'whore', but she was a great spymaster, a diplomat, and an incredible tactitian. I cheered for her to find her rightful place in her world, because she earned that after all she'd suffered and lost. I loved Joscelin as well. Although he was a bit judgmental at times, so was Phedre towards him, but in a different way. It was very clear how devoted to her he was, and he was very true to his beliefs, following Cassiel, the angel who still loved God, but felt that he had to follow Elua out of loyalty. I admired that he made sacrifices to follow his beliefs, but his love for Phedre often caused him to break his vows, which in a way showed how true to following Cassiel he was. Even though he was not the main character, my mind always went back to him, wanting to see what he was doing and how he reacted to the situations around him. All the characters were real and lifelike, some in a good way, some in a bad way. But, there weren't any disposable characters in this story, even if they played small roles. And when some of the characters I grew to love got harmed and died, it made for painful reading.At first, I had a lot of trouble with all the names of the characters and people, and countries. But, after a while, it started to make sense, and I was able to connect them to an existing frame of reference pretty well. I think it was pretty brilliantly conceived. The various peoples were extremely culturally distinct, and I really appreciated the time that Ms. Carey took to explore their cultures. It was interesting how the D'Angelines had a lot of cultural superiority that they had to get past, in order to face a huge threat from within and from the warlike, intimidating Skaldi race.What surprised me was that I found the military aspects very fascinating. Maybe I shouldn't be surprised, because I've always had an admiration for warriors and the culture of warriors. I thought that seeing the battles and war unfold through Phedre's eyes was very interesting. I liked seeing how she used her particular skill set to aid her country in winning the war. The sacrifices she made for her country were very admirable. She showed that although she wasn't a warrior in the traditional sense, her heart was that of a warrior, willing to give everything to win and prevail, even if that involved personal sacrifice and surrender.This was a deep book. It took me through a gamut of emotions, many not comfortable at all. It truly was epic, and I really didn't get bored, surprisingly considering its length and complexity. There were some very unpalatable aspects to this story, and the values seemed very alien to what I feel I hold sacred. However, underneath there is a commonality. Love is sacrifice, love is giving. When something is important to a person, one devotes herself to it. Even though the creeds of the people in this book seemed alien, I could identify with the idea of holding something sacred in life, and that dictating one's actions.As one can imagine, it's not easy to sum up my thoughts on a book that is so long and rather complicated. I think I have done as best as I can, and I won't make this review any longer than necessary. I have to be honest and say I highly doubt I'll keep reading this series. It's a huge investment of my time and energy when books are this long. And since it took me to some uncomfortable places, I'm not sure I want to go through that process any more with the following books. In my mind, I want to think of Phedre and Joscelin being happy, able to find a compromise that works for both of them, and having a great love. I want to leave things that way. The good thing is, this book is a keeper, and will have fond memories of these characters who came to mean so much to me. Perhaps I will reread this book one day to revisit this fascinating world of the D'Angelines.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/153008.Kushiel_s_Dart,Kushiel's Dart.txt
Magician: Apprentice,"I have a Booktube channel now! Subscribe here:https://www.youtube.com/petrikleo3.5/5 starsMagician: Apprenticeis a familiar and enjoyable start to a beloved classic fantasy series.“Pug would have been the first to tell me that nothing is forever. That living in the past is foolish and robs us of the future.”I’ve heard a lot of great things aboutRiftwar SagaandRiftwar Cycleby Raymond E. Feist for years now; it is one of the series that I know has sparked a lot of reader’s passion for reading fantasy books. And that’s always a good thing in my dictionary. Honestly speaking, though, I don't have nostalgia goggles for this series. The main reason why I wanted to readRiftwar Sagawas so that I could dive intoRiftwar: Empiretrilogy without missing any necessary details. The reason for my slight reluctance in reading theRiftwar Sagatrilogy was because I don’t often gel well with fantasy books written pre-1990. I tend to find either the writing too outdated now without nostalgia goggles, or the story being too clichéd already. To be fair... Most of the time, these series invented the clichés. It is not a fault per se. Is this applicable toMagician: Apprentice? Yes and no. And on my reread after finishingRiftwar: Empiretrilogy, many parts I struggled with on my first read felt more tolerable.“’Tis a wise thing to know what is wanted, and wiser still to know when ‘tis achieved.‘True. And still wiser to know when it is unachievable, for then striving is folly.’”Now, I realize thatMagician: Apprenticeis the first half of a single big book namedThe Magician. Although it’s true thatMagician: Apprenticeended on an awkward scene, I also totally understand whyMagicianwas divided into two books. Especially on my reread. First of all,The Magicianas a single book is as big asSilverthornandA Darkness at Sethanoncombined. Secondly,The Magicianas a single book might feel too long for some readers. I know many fans of the series loved the fact thatThe Magicianis being rereleased as a single book, but having it divided into two parts gave readers the right moment to stop and take a break before continuing with the second half of the series:Magician: Master. But most importantly, I do think there is a big change inMagician: Masteras Feist started to turn the series into his own thing while retaining influences from Tolkien.“Magicians are training to seek explanations. Understanding things is very important to us.”One of the purposes ofMagician: Apprenticeis to introduce the readers to the characters, the world, and the premise of the series. It is a big plus to me that none of the main characters ever felt infuriating. The friendship between the two main characters—Pug and Tomas—was one of my favorite parts of the book. In general, I think Feist is good at portraying genuine friendship. It felt believable, and through a similar landscape of tropes, Feist did a great job developing and preparing the characters for the events to unfold inMagician: Master. The highlight ofMagician: Apprenticeis Tomas and his constant conflict with the power of the legendary Ashen-Shugar. You don't get to see a lot of them here. But as I said, this shines inMagician: Master.“Some love comes like the wind off the sea, while others grow slowly from the seeds of friendship and kindness.""From stories, tropes, and execution,Magician: Apprenticeis without a doubt a classic fantasy. I, as a reader, love classic fantasy elements but gravitate a bit more toward a modern narrative structure and pacing. The issues I often have with classic fantasy are not the tropes or familiarity; I love them. But the way they're written. That’s what I do appreciate so much about Feist’s writing style. Don’t get me wrong, the writing still felt outdated at times. Understandably. This is a book written in the 1980's and it is very clear from the prose. For example, the progression of each chapter does not feel seamless at times. There were some occasions where the chapters felt like a series of connecting short stories combined into a novel.“The faults we see in others never seem as dreadful as those we see in ourselves.”Similar to many fantasy novels in the 80s or older, I have some issues with the way the action scenes are written. While I agree many classic fantasy writers are amazing world-builders, actions in classic fantasy novels often feel brushed off or end too quickly. Personally, I was not a big fan of Arutha's storyline. His scenes and war scenes in the book felt overwritten, while Pug's and Tomas's battle scenes ended too quickly to my liking. That being said, for a book published 40 years ago, I am pleasantly surprised by how relatively accessible the writing felt. Also, before I forget, speaking of Tolkien earlier—Elves and Dwarves aside—there was an obvious ode to Moria in Mac Mordain Cadal. This is the moment Tomas's story turned into something great for me.“Father used to say that, among man’s strange undertakings, war stood clearly forth as the strangest.”As I said, the book ended in an unsatisfying manner. The two main characters—Pug and Tomas—weren’t even featured in the last few chapters. I remember putting down the series after I was done withMagician: Master. But because I am rereading this after I finished the absolutely incredibleRiftwar: Empiretrilogy, I’m more hopeful about the second half ofMagiciannow.Magician: Apprenticehas served its purpose as an introduction and foundation of the series. Despite some evident issues I had with it, judging from my reread experience with a clearer understanding and knowledge of the Kelewan and Tsurannis, I expect to have a superior reading experience on my reread ofMagician: Master. I am hopeful this reread, this time of the entire trilogy, will improve my reread ofRiftwar: Empiretrilogy.“Well, knowing your own part in this is a good sign that you’re becoming a man.

The Lightning Thief,"Chiron looked surprised. “I thought that would be obvious enough.The entrance to the Underworld is in Los Angeles.”As someone who has worked in Los Angeles, I can tell you that this is completely accurate.While Harry Potter was spending his summers at the Dursleys, Percy Jackson attended Camp Half-Blood. This book has done the impossible:it has redeemed the name of Percy.Yes, that's right, that snot-faced, lily-livered waste of air of the very same name from theHarry Potteruniverse. That name is now relegated to the ranks of ""acceptable,"" because of my love for this book.Perseus (Percy) Jackson is the kind of kid with whom you can't help sympathizing. He is the type that's born under a dark star, because inevitably, wherever he goes, whatever he does, however good his intentions, he can't help but fuck everything up. Everything that can, does and will go wrong. A simple field trip can turn into a disaster in seconds.Jay-Z's got 99 problems, Percy might have more. He nearly flunks all his classes, he's got dyslexia, he's got ADHD, and then there's Nancy Bobofit.Nancy Bobofit appeared in front of me with her ugly friends—I guess she’d gotten tired of stealing from the tourists—and dumped her half-eaten lunch in Grover’s lap.“Oops.” She grinned at me with her crooked teeth. Her freckles were orange, as if somebody had spray-painted her face with liquid Cheetos.Nancy Bobofit is not a major character in the book. I have to mention her because her character resounded with me. I had my own Nancy Bobofit back in grade school, only her name is Mimi. Nearly 2 decades later, the memory of her horrible face still makes me shudder. But I digress.As if the bullies aren't bad enough, his dad is a no-show, his stepfather is LITERALLY named Ugli, and there are crones foretelling Percy's death as well as a minotaur chasing his ass around. AND NOBODY'S TELLING HIM A SINGLE FUCKING THING. What's with all the secrecy, man?As it turned out, Percy is *whispers* special. He is a half-blood, meaning one of his parents is a Greek deity. He gets sent to Camp Half-Blood, with roughly 100 other kids like him.It's a freaky place for a kid who's known nothing but relative normalcy his entire life. All of a sudden, he's playing Pinochle with a Greek God (Dionysus---what a drunk), his best friend Grover turns out to be a satyr, and the gorgeous blond girl who rescues him thinks he's a doofus and she keeps calling him""seaweed brain.""To be fair, Percy had it coming. He is kind of a seaweed brain.""Another time, Athena and Poseidon competed to be the patron god for the city of Athens. Your dad created some stupid saltwater spring for his gift. My mom created the olive tree. The people saw that her gift was better, so they named the city after her.”“They must really like olives.”“Oh, forget it.”“Now, if she’d invented pizza—that I could understand.”“I said, forget it!”Not your best moment, Percy.As it turned out, Percy IS special. His dad is one of the Big Three gods. Which kind of sucks, because that's not supposed to happen.“About sixty years ago, after World War II, the Big Three agreed they wouldn’t sire any more heroes. Their children were just too powerful.""A lot of people would think it was pretty cool to have such a powerful dad...not really.Now that I was declared a son of one of the Big Three gods who weren’t supposed to have kids, I figured it was a crime for me just to be alive.Not only does Percy have to struggle to fit in at Camp Half-Blood, but there's some shit going on in Mount Olympus. The gods are fighting again (when are they not)...""During the winter solstice, at the last council of the gods, Zeus and Poseidon had an argument. The usual nonsense: ‘Mother Rhea always liked you best,’ ‘Air disasters are more spectacular than sea disasters,’ et cetera.""...and consequently, like a brother playing a prank on his younger siblings, someone's stuff was stolen. And Zeus thinks that his bro, Poseidon, put Percy up to it.Of course, blame the poor kid. Now Percy is shit out of luck YET AGAIN, and he's got no choice but to go on this huge stupid quest into the underworld (Los Angeles, ha!) to clear his name.He's not alone, he's accompanied by thesnarky, gorgeous, fiercely competent Annabeth(she of the seaweed brain name-calling), as well asthe most incompetent satyr that ever lived.In his pocket was a set of reed pipes his daddy goat had carved for him, even though he only knew two songs: Mozart’s Piano Concerto no. 12 and Hilary Duff’s “So Yesterday,” both of which sounded pretty bad on reed pipes.It's going to be a loooooooong trip to the Underworld.The Setting: THIS. THIS IS HOW YOU DO GREEK MYTHOLOGY. I am a Greek mythology buff. I FUCKING LOVED THIS BOOK. This book is just absolutely fucking perfect in every way when it comes to rewriting and reinterpreting the Greek pantheon. It is so hilariously, awesomely irreverent, but completely fitting. The gods are reimagined, but they stay true to their true nature, andthe myths are retold in a cheeky, flippant manner that had me giggling my ass off. This book is so fantastically snarky to the Greek gods. Everything is incredibly well-explained to a lay audience, like how the Greek gods can't seem to keep it in their pants.Annabeth nodded. “Your father isn’t dead, Percy. He’s one of the Olympians.”“That’s...crazy.”“Is it? What’s the most common thing gods did in the old stories? They ran around falling in love with humans and having kids with them. Do you think they’ve changed their habits in the last few millennia?”And apparently, the habit runs true for both male and female goddesses.“What? You assume it has to be a male god who finds a human female attractive? How sexist is that?”The existence of Greek gods and goddesses themselves are well explained, and believable.“Come now, Percy. What you call ‘Western civilization.’ Do you think it’s just an abstract concept? No, it’s a living force. A collective consciousness that has burned bright for thousands of years. The gods are part of it.""""Did the West die? The gods simply moved, to Germany, to France, to Spain, for a while. Wherever the flame was brightest, the gods were there. They spent several centuries in England. All you need to do is look at the architecture. People do not forget the gods.""I had my doubts about the execution of the premise of Greek mythology, and all my doubts have been destroyed.his book does great justice to the Greek gods, it is the most faithful rendition than I have ever read.The Characters: Yes, Percy is a special snowflake, but HELL, I LOVED THE LITTLE SHIT. He's got a special destiny. He is a special child. I DON'T CARE. Percy is such a sympathetic character, and although he won't be replacing Harry Potter in my heart any time soon, there is a special spot for him. He can give up pretty fast. He's kind of a wimp, but you know, finding out that you're a hald-blooded demigod is kind of a big deal, and I understand his attitude of ""GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.""I didn’t know what else to do. I waved back.“Don’t encourage them,” Annabeth warned. “Naiads are terrible flirts.”“Naiads,” I repeated, feeling completely overwhelmed. “That’s it. I want to go home now.”He doesn't really want to do anything big. He's pretty stupid sometimes (Auntie Em, geez), he's not exactly heroic. He only does the heroic shit when there are no other options.“All right,” I said. “It’s better than being turned into a dolphin.”I loved Annabeth, she is all I could want from a female supporting character. I can't say that I'm fond of Grover...but I can't help feeling that we'll be seeing more of him in the future.“But a quest to . . .” Grover swallowed. “I mean, couldn’t the master bolt be in some place like Maine? Maine’s very nice this time of year.”Overall: a fantastic book.A good middle grade book makes you feel like a child again, and this book did just the trick.I found myself giggling throughout the book, and an hour after reading it, there's still a smile on my face that can't be wiped off.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123675190-the-lightning-thief,The Lightning Thief.txt
The Black Prism,"I originally set the rating of this book at 4 stars, but decided it needed to be moved up to the 5 star level. I don't find it as good as many of the books I rate 5 stars, but it drew me in and held me tells a story that beats 4 stars. So, without the much lamented 4.5 that so many of us here pine for, I've rated it 5.So, I like the book and give it the highest rating possible here (albeit noting it's not at the top of my 5 star pile)...what's so good about it? And, if it's not at the top of the 5 star category, where does it fall (a bit) short?Well, first of all the worst thing about this book is....that the next (second) volume of this trilogy is nowhere in sight along the literary horizon. I know, I've searched. I put off reading this for a long time fearing exactly this situation. Having read theThe Night Angel Trilogyand liked it, I suspected I'd like this one. However where I bought the entire Night Angel trilogy in an omnibus and read it straight through...I'm now into another series, at the mercy of a writer, his agent, editor, publisher and whoever else may be involved. How many series am I stuck in the middle of? I dare not think about it.Oh well. Let us move on.The book starts out well jumping into the story and laying a bit ground work we will need for the ""plot devices"" and the magical system.There are in this book a LOT of stereotypical characters and plot devices or points. But, don't let that statement mislead and give you a negative idea. It would be all but impossible (if not totally impossible) to come up with a genuinely brand new plot and or character. Most any you can think of have already been thought of and used before. The key is to use them in original ways and make it interesting. Mr. Weeks does that.(I won't mention any of these ""tropes"" [I hate to use the word ""trope"", it's so over used and misused...however it's probably the best choice in this case]...tropes, here as that would entail spoilers.)The magic system in this book is relatively original (I've seen magic systems based on color/colors before (Brandon Sanderson recently had one in a popular book). Still I'd say this is a direct magic system with enough logic to hold together while also having enough openendedness to be built on later. In other words the colors each have their own properties but there's room for some surprises later. (Note there are a few glitches in his spectrum use, but nothing to be upset about. I remember spotting one that niggled at me at the time, but I've forgotten the specifics now).Moving on to plot and characters...well as I said you'll recognize some plot points from other (some well known) works. The characters are fairly well drawn and while maybe not as deep as some would like I find them to my taste and that they fit well into the book, it's world and it's situations. My one gripe might be with Kip, one of our main characters. Without giving details I'll simply say that he's a 15 year old youth of a peasant village who has had to fend for himself at least somewhat for years. Yet still for a long time he acts a bit spoiled and strikes me as acting more like a 12 or even 10 year old than a 15 year old. In a society of the type we find here a 15 year old would be a young man (at least).The book does lay out a mildly intricate story with well drawn characters that will (I believe) draw you in and...quite probably hook you. Which means you will, like me, end it restraining yourself from the use of foul language (or in some of your cases possibly not restraining yourself) as you realize that there is now the wait for volume 2 and after that volume 3...Uhhh....Mr. Weeks, I'm not a young man anymore. Try not to take too long, okay????Good book, recommended, enjoy.***************** Spoilers Below Line ******************I mentioned that you will note some ""types"" here. I'm about to mention a couple of spoilers so don't read on if you don't want to know...First we have Kip. The peasant hero. A young boy, fat and immature son of a somewhat abusive, neglectful mother who is a drunk and drug addict, he's also the illegitimate son of (duh, duh, duh) the Prism (read King or Emperor here). The Prism is a ruler (sort of king/religious leader/head wizard) who was forced to fight a war against his brother, who claimed to be The Prism, to see who's the REAL Prism. It was called The False Prism's war. The Prism (Gavin) was forced to kill his brother (Dazen). EXCEPT!!!! He didn't kill Dazen. The Prism's brother is imprisoned in a magical cell underneath the Prism's palace where only the Prism and his room slave know he is kept. EXCEPT!!! Dazen isn't the one in the cell! Dazen defeated Gavin took his identity and replaced him as Prism, imprisoning the elder (and less worthy brother). So...the Prism is Dazen, but everyone thinks he's Gavin...got that?Now the war was fought partially or maybe mostly over a woman...who is apparently extremely beautiful as not only the two brothers who fought the war fell in love with her...but so did the false king we meet later...who is rebelling against the Prism...who's not supposed to be the Prism...Oh, and of course that means that Kip who just found out the Prism is his father is really the nephew of the man he's calling father...There are other plot points like the Prism being forced by circumstances to kill most of the woman he loves family (I don't recall any of them being named Tybalt...but I won't swear to it)...Get the picture? The Man in the Iron Mask (movie version, not book)...Romeo and Juliet...peasant hero...brother kings fighting over same woman (who by the way is updated a bit as she has gone on to become a ""kicka** warrior"". No wilting violate love interest here), there's also a rebel general and his child (daughter)(who knows better than anyone else and will not listen to anyone especially the said father) as seen in sooo many places. No need to go on.BUT...let me say again these are all handled well and the fact that you'll spot all these doesn't really take away from the book. They are handled well and we all know that stereotypes become stereotypes precisely because they sometimes actually are common or in literature work well. These plot points are well done and fit together very nicely...you can even follow the story without a separate program to keep track of the players. :)Again, I like it. I recommend it.

Traitor's Blade,"“The First Law is that men are free for without the freedom to choose, men cannot serve their heart, and without heart they cannot serve their Gods, their Saints, or their King.”King’s Laws“All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.”Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 1What aprecarious mix of fantastic ideas and far-fetched conveniencesthis book was.On the level of pure page-turning entertainment, it was all you could ask for. But if you are looking for more than fun in your novels, you will find the Traitor’s Blade wanting.There arefour main elements that make the Traitor’s Blade exceptional: As we follow the story of Falcio val Mond, First Cantor of the Greatcoats, together with his companions, master swordsman Kest and archery master Brasti, we are immersed in theircamaraderie, bonds of friendship and mutual trust, and loyaltystemming from shared ideals. Theirbanter is priceless. Dialogue lines are sparkling with wry humour and seem effortless, a far cry from a strained comedy script so many fantasy books are prone to these days.Action scenes are of similar quality. There are many fights, duels, two (or even five) to one encounters with many weapons, settings, and fighting techniques. These are not rehearsed choreographies of martial prowess and give the impressions of authenticity. It is evident that Mr de Castell is into fencing and knows the business of sticking the pointy end of rapier into the opponent. He uses this knowledge well.Finally, the variety of main and supporting characters is seconded byinteresting character development. The book focuses on Falcio and his personal journey from a small fatherless boy to the leader of Greatcoats will not leave a single reader unperturbed. I hope we will learn more of the other two in the coming instalments. Kest’s backstory is merely hinted at, while Brasti remains enigma behind the loverboy facade.“Ah, you fool. Dying isn’t the sacrifice. Haven’t you figured that out yet? All those years of trying to get yourself killed in battle? That ain’t sacrifice, boy. That’s self-loathing. It’s gleeful suicide. It’s vanity.”As for the reasons whythis book deserves not an inch above the three-star rating, there are two significant flaws: worldbuilding and plot conveniences.The world we are given is your generic medieval (plus pistols) kingdom with magic, although the magic system is not developed at all. The settings give you a favour of longing for good times ended prematurely by an untimely and dramatic murder of a good king Paelis. Paelis is your typical king-scholar, king-idealist, a good monarch not really fit to live in the harsh times and realities of the land he governed.“When they take the last good thing from your life, there must be an answer.”Tristia is a land in theory ruled by a king and his law, in reality, a loose federation of duchies run like private farms by the Dukes and Duchesses of whom each and every single one is a greedy, selfish, and cruel person heedless of the well being and safety of their people. You see the problems? Wait, there is more.The king sees that the land is weak and decaying and breaking apart because of the injustice of the nobility, but somehow entirely ignores the lack of a strong and unifying political power which his own office should supply. And so, he sets for to solve the conundrum with the mindset of a human rights defender. However,if you’d like to mesh UDHR with the medieval mindset you need to tread carefully lest you want to end up in a world of paradoxes. And there are paradoxes abound.“First we bring justice, then we bring change,” thinks the King and so he revives the Greatcoats.If you believe that Greatcoats are basically Musketeers but with coats instead of capes, you couldn’t be more mistaken. On the surface, you would think that the Greatcoats are warriors or perhaps some form of an elite fighting formation. But effectively,they are a weird cross-breed between troubadours and lawyers. They need to know laws and they sing them. According to the design, the power of the Greatcoat theoretically relies on the ability to render just judgment “as a solution to the fracturing in the heart of the people.” And yet, the Traitor’s Blade is not filled with legal nuances of sophisticated judicial interpretations, it is all about fighting styles, parries, and the like. Greatcoat training is military first, legal second. So you essentially end up being a fighting judge or a martial advocate. Tell this to anyone studying hard for the bar (just to make them laugh).The king is not bothered thataside from his 140 coated darlings there is no force, no official structure, no state institutions to uphold justice or enforce the laws. And don’t be deceived, it is explained that the Greatcoats, were the king’s gift to the world and the most important accomplishment of his lifetime. Why did he invest only in his expensive toys and nothing else? Why did he do so at a great expense of the whole country?What is the law existing on the paper or in the head of the ruler without a political process to make it implemented if not a utopia?In contrast to very mature, grimdark content, including rape, torture and other vile deeds, the political design is so improbable and idealistic, that it places the Traitor’s Blade in the YA category.Great monarchs need time to build strong kingdoms, it doesn’t happen overnight and rarely through revolutions. I am sure this wisdom is easily discernible in every history book available so it escapes me how a scholarly man like Paelis, could ignore this simple dogma of sustainable governance.“The dream doesn’t have to be dead if we keep believing in it.”There are unexplained plotholesthe wise king with all kinds of money and contacts is disturbingly easy to dispose of when the Dukes gang up on him. The people, who benefited from monarchy, didn’t really love the king and hate the Greatcoats with venom., plot conveniencesone word: Tailor!, plot curiositiestake the little girl Aline, how she survives the carnage of her family and is saved in spite of being captured by the ruthless Duke! but most importantly, how she behaves and talks (like a woman of 30 not a girl of 13)of which the main quest of the weirdestJust before the untimely demise of the King each of the Greatcoats has received from him a separate mission calledgaes. We do not know what these are for Kest or Brasti. Falcio’s quest is to find King’s Charoites that is, to say it crudely King’s illegal brats produced in secret as if he couldn’t just marry and beget legitimate offspring. But Falcio doesn’t really know what he’s looking for because the king sends his First Cantor, his most trusted friend!, on a quest without clear cut directions and guidelines (“Look for them but do not expect to find them”). So our poor Falcio follows the trail of rumour, and gossip and his stubborn hope. How ridiculous is that? Similarly, I do not understand how is possible that the dukes killed the king so easily but struggle to establish new monarchyand one-dimensional villains (save one)(Trin, and oh what a good plot twist that was!).In spite of these shortcomings, Traitor's Blade is an enjoyable novel and I have high hopes for the whole series.Other Greatcoats books:2.Knight's Shadow★★★☆☆3.Saint's Blood★☆☆☆☆4.Tyrant's Throne★☆☆☆☆",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20887238-traitor-s-blade,Traitor's Blade.txt

The other big problem is the black-and-white world-building.World ofGracelingGracelingis set in a european-ish medieval land with horses, taverns, kings, castles, and anything else you would except to find in such a place. The land is divided into seven kingdoms: Lienid (the island kingdom), Monsea (a kingdom closed off by the mountains), Middluns (the middle kingdom), and Nander, Estill, Sunder, Wester, which surround Middluns on the North, East, South, and West side, respectively. (See what Cashore did there?) Another aspect is the Graced; some people are born with special abilities called ""Graces"" such as mind-reading, excellent swimming skills, killing, etc. There is great prejudice against the Graced (except in Lienid) and one can tell if another person is Graced if the person's eyes are mismatched colors. (Random comment: One of my friends has eyes like this. It's a condition called heterochromia iridum. But sadly, my friend has no superpowers. :( ) Anyways...I think we can all agree that European medieval worlds are definitely overdone;nearly every epic fantasy or high fantasy is set in one! However, authors can still make them fresh if they add complexity to them with new aspects or intriguing history.Examples of Fresh, Intriguing WorldsFor example, in Cinda Williams Chima'sSeven Realms, the generic fantasy world is made fresh by complex struggles between Gray Wolf Queens, Clan, and Wizards. There is a well-developed and unique culture in the world, stemming from the struggles between Clan and Wizards, and the history is complex and believable.Another example isThe Well Between the Worlds. It is a retelling of the King Arthur tale, set in a medieval world, but adds the elements of the Wells, the sinking of Lyonnesse, and industrialization to make a breathtakingly fresh and original world.So, what's the matter withGraceling'sworld?WhyGraceling'sWorld-building Simply Isn't Good EnoughFirst off, there are only a few fresh aspects of this world:1.) The idea of the Graced2.) Some cultural aspects of the Lienid (like the gold jewelry, Po's tattoos, and the ring/inheritance thing....and that's pretty much it.But there's got to be more! Anything! Tell me,is there...A religion?No.History?(Like references to why the kingdoms are how they are, etc?) Nope.Mythology/legends/storiesabout old heroes, Graced, etc.? No.Unique cultural aspects?None.Anything that separates the world of Graceling from other fantasies?I'm sorry, but there is, other than the Graced, nothing original here.Okay, okay, we get it! Nothing new here! But sometimes, generic fantasy worlds are complex. There are complex issues, complex characters, and complex motivations which make up for the lack of originality. In fact, a world lacking new ideas sometimes portrays old ideas in a new light! What about Graceling? Is there any complexity?Lack of complexity in GracelingPart One: The Inhabitants of the worldEEEEEEVIL PEOPLE:- The villain,King Leck.Why is he evil? Because he is! What does he do? Torture animals! He evenkilled his own wife!He is so EEEEEVIL!- King Randa. Poor Katsa! Her EEEEEEVIL uncle is making her kill people! Does he feel the slightest guilt or remorse? No! Does he have a good reason for this? Yes, so he can be evenmorepowerful! MWAHAHAHAHA!- Those other kings! (Except for King Ror, who is good.) They are always squabbling over borders and killing poor peasants and stuff. How horrible of them! They are so EEEEEVIL! And one of them evenheld a poor old guy prisoner, just so he could be rich!MEAN people- Basically, everyone non-Graced. They just don't understand what it's like! Now that I think about it, all of Katsa's friends are either Graced or have a family member who is Graced (or are Lienid). The only exception is Oll.- Giddon. He is so condescending! And he doesn't understand Katsa! And he's so stupid, he thinks he can protect her! Even when she can kick his ass! This portrayal bugs me, because it feels like a gimmick to show how good Katsa is, and how she deserves a good man in her life, and blah blah blah.GOOD PEOPLE- Katsa is forced to kill people by her uncle. But wait, she is really good! Don't believe me? She created an organization called The Council, which does nice stuff! She is so angelic! Admittedly, Cashore did give her a few personality flaws, but not enough. I mean, when you can kill and entire army without even a sword, wouldn't you be extremely selfish and extremely spoiled? I admit, I would be.- Po. He is SOOOO noble! He still loves Katsa even ifshe won't marry him.And his secret is OK. Yes, Katsa is mad, but he is SOOOOOOO nice she doesn't care.- Lienid people! They are so nice to the Graced! They respect them 'n stuff.- Everyone not in the MEAN or EEEEEVL section. They are brave, noble, etc. No one is ever a mixture of good and evil.Part Two: The World ItselfThe world ofGracelinglacks nuance. When you look at the history of Europe, there are ancient alliances, complex relations, etc. between the countries. Not to mention, the citizens of each country see themselves in one way and see people from other countries in other way. There are stereotypes, symbols, legends, and histories that may or may not be real. (And not just in Europe, everywhere.)I was expecting well-developed relations between the kingdoms and between normal people and Graced people. I mean, Katsa and Po have to travel across many countries and I wanted to see them struggle against prejudices and stereotypes.However, they had had it extremely easy. Here is the extent to which all the relationships were developed:- Normal people hate the Graced! (For no apparent reason) All you see is a strong dislike, no complex feelings. (For example, being in awe of their powers, yet feeling jealous)- Kingdoms fight over borders. That is pretty much it. Their only dislike comes from border squabbles.And... that's about it.Anyways, readingGracelingwas an underwhelming experience. I mean, the first time I read it, I was in middle school, and even then I was disappointed!Recommendations:Many people loved this book. You might too, if you:1.) Love a good kick-ass heroine2.) Are looking for a fun adventure3.) Want lots of action in your fantasy4.) Love reading about kind, noble men in love with misfit girlsBut you might not if you:1.) Are looking for a deep exploration of feminist ideas2.) Require complex, original world-building3.) Need complex characters4.) Want a complex plotFinal Comment:Gracelingisn't a bad book. For me it was 2.5 stars (2.5 = a little more enjoyable than ""meh"") There is some decent character development, some exciting action, and a somewhat original plot. Also, other than the overwrought feminism,Gracelingdoesn't have any big flaws that might insult the reader and completely ruin the reading experience. There was also some humor and some quotable moments, my favorite being,“When a monster stopped behaving like a monster, did it stop being a monster? Did it become something else?”during a moment of poignant character introspection. (Speaking of that, there were some great ideas concerning what it means to be a monster.) All of this made Graceling an OK book. However,Gracelingfeels like an edited draft - there are good ideas, good editing, but nothing is really fleshed out. Let's hope in future books, Cashore spends more time on her story.Alternatives:- For a complex fantasy,Seven Realmsis an terrific four-book series. Book 1 (The Demon King) is mostly a set-up book, with fantastic world-building, but familiar (and somewhat cliche) characters. Book 2 (The Exiled Queen) is great; the characters deepen, and the plot thickens. Book 3 (The Gray Wolf Throne) is absolutely stunning; intricate plotlines come perfectly together, characterization is amazing, and the tension is almost unbearable. And Book 4 (The Crimson Crown) is the kind of book so jaw-droppingly amazing, you feel like crying just because the book ENDED.- For a (urban-ish) fantasy/Para-Normal Romance, (don't worry, there romance isn't annoying]) with a totally kick-ass heroine, original world-building, and gorgeous prose, check outDaughter of Smoke and Boneby Laini Taylor.- For a short, rich fantasy (that won the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award) with a strong heroine who is selfish (but gets better) and has a coming-of-age story, I recommend Franny Billingsley'sThe Folk Keeper. There is also an exciting mystery (with more than one twist), and just the tiniest dash of romance. Plus, as a bonus, the prose is lovely.- I've heard that theThe Queen's Thiefseries by Megan Whalen Turner are fantastic, especially those after book 1 (The Thief.) I admit, I have not read them yet, but book 1 won the Newberry Honor medal, and many ""picky"" reviewers say they are fantastic.-The Well Between the Worldsby Sam Llewelyn is also a terrific, original novel. Yes, it is a children's book (ages 10+) but so wasHis Dark Materials. And just likeHis Dark Materials, TWBTW is sophisticated, well-written, and a lot of fun. And isn't it said that a good children's book can be enjoyed by adults as well?Anyways, I hope this review helps anyone thinking about whether or not they should readGraceling.Random:Those of you not familiar with the Teletubbies theme song, this might seem weird. But I hope you can sympathize with my frustration with theGracelingnames.So, here is a parody:TheGraceling/TeletubbiesParody*To the tune of theTeletubbytheme song*Tinkywinky...Dipsey...Katsa...Po...Teletubbies...

Poison Study,"What do you ask for usually in ayoung-adult fantasy book?➳Relatable andactuallysmart heroine? ✔✔✔✔✔➳A sexy witty love interest who is ALSO an assassin (that's a plus!)? ✔✔✔✔✔✔✔➳World building? ✔✔✔✔➳An enjoyable story? ✔✔✔✔✔➳A good plot—one that doesn’t stray too far off topic and does progress throughout the story? ✔✔✔✔✔➳More actions less romance? ✔✔✔✔✔➳A well-written book? ✔✔✔✔✔I can go on all day. It's been a long while since I loved a book this much, from page one till the end.Yelena was sentenced to death because she has killed someone. She's been in the dungeon for a year now, waiting for execution. But when she's offered a chance to live, she didn't think twice about it and accepted even though she knew the risks. She has to be the Commander's food taster and thus study all kinds of poison with Valek(my heart).Yet she didn't just kill someone, but one of the generals son who took her under his wing when she was a little. Sounds harsh? Not when the father and the son hide behind manners -in front of the Commander, at least. Therefore he wants his revenge.Yelena is the caught in the midst of a subtle mayhem of politics, spies, assassins, conspiracies, secrets, treacheries, and magic where she tries her best to survive.I didn't start Poison Study expecting to be flabbergasted. I was expecting something good but nothing mindblowing. And now all I can think of, why the heck didn't I read this book sooner. I cherished every word of it. Yet, this way no young-adult. Yelena is 19 yo and Valek around 33, it's illogical for this to be shelved as YA. I read thatMaria V Snyderdidn't write this book as a young-adult but the publishers chose to. While it didn't have any sex scenes, this book included rape and other sexual assaults and form of sadistic violence that we don't find in this genre. I wish this book was written as an adult fantasy only, we would have more smut scenes.I craved those.Let's start with Yelena, she is far from being your usual young-adult heroine, smart, wise and strong, she tried her best to survive all the hardships. She started to train, to learn useful abilities, and so much more so she can be able to be independent. Her character development was obvious, even if I liked her from the beginning and found it easy to relate to her, she fascinated toward the end. One of the best thing about her, that we didn't hear endless praise of her beauty, she was pretty but unlike other heroines nowadays, not everyone she meets in amazed by her appearance. She also isn't white! Snyder did a decent job in mixing color skins -not that people's outside looks really mattered. I don't think I loved any character because of that in this book because honestly, I don't remember what the secondary characters looked like and it's not the author's fault because she did describe them when Yelena first saw them. And it stopped there. Sometimes authors relentlessly remind us of their characters looks to cover the lack of depth in their personality.Valek. Now Valek is my new book boyfriend. And no, I don't share. Undoubtedly, he was my favorite character in the book.I just love mysterious men and on top of that he's an assassin! Sexiness overload! I fell in love with him with Yelena,slowly at first then all at once. He was kind in his own way, sweet, caring, brave, loving, loyal, daring, smart, and so much more! At first glance, you may think that he's only a tool who execute the Commander's orders but when you look in the depth of the book, you see that he's the mastermind. While he's loyal to death, he isn't blind. Both, Valek and Yelena know that the law, theCode of Behavior, has its flaws (we'll get to this later). He tries to find loopholes in his own way. He's just wonderful! Even though he prefer to avoid unnecessary deaths, he will do whatever he can to achieve his goal without remorse. Unlike Yelena, who feels terribly guilty after killing someone, even if she had no other choice.Valek and Yelena are now one of my favorite OTPs. Ever. I ship them so hard! Yes, he is 14 years older than her but I didn't find it wrong. I didn't mind the age difference yet I usually, do. Yelena wasn't childish, she was mature and old beyond her years. They understood each other and fought for their love, even before they admitted their feelings for themselves. They just make the perfect couple together. I loved the slow romance and the tension building.Many would say the story was slow at first. While nothing major was happening in the beginning, I still couldn't put the book down. That should tell you enough. The writing style was compelling and I couldn't get enough of our characters. And I'm not only speaking about Yelena and Valek but also about secondary characters, especially Janco and Ari. I adored those two. Admired their loyalty and faith in our girl. They did their best to improve her self-defense skills.While the Commander wasn't my favorite part of the story, we can't deny his leadership skills. The law is binding and even him, the one who promulgated it, isn't above the Code of Behavior. That doesn't mean this law was fair. It's illogical to execute a person who killed another even without meaning to. I really admired Snyder for making a law to her own world, being a law student and all, it's something I don't see often even if it wasn't anywhere near complex enough. However, I think she wanted us to see that even laws can be wrong. Even the Commander who defeated the tyrant king and made a new country, is also a dictator. The fact that he is a good ruler (with a bad Code) doesn't affect that truth, not even known to the people. I always like to have some politics in my fiction books, it's one of the reasons why I love A Song of Ice and fire that much, and even though this book nothing that heavy, it was appreciated. We also didn't have a complex world building but this book is so fun if you're looking for a light fantasy. I mean sure it gets dark sometimes but other than the imagined world and the magic touch, we don't have many fantasy elements, just to clarify this book.***Minor spoilers ahead***When you rate a book, the highest you can give is 5 stars on GR. And to express your endless love and admiration for it, you add it to your favorites. Those, at least to me, are as flawless as possible. I debated adding this book to my favorites or not but I didn't because I did have some issues with it. I was soo in love with it when I finished it but when you start analyzing the book and your cynical part terminates the fangirl, you try to be more objective. I don't think anyone can be objective while reviewing a book except for some basic stuff because it's a matter of taste. I did my best, though. I'm not going to dwell much on the negatives but I want to say that it felt rushed toward the end. The book could have done better with 30 or so pages because everything was happening so fast. Especially the romance.Suddently they confessed their love and I was like, sorry? That quickly? We didn't even have enough loving Valek thoughts in her mind. If these two things were handled in a better way, this book would have easily made it to my favorites shelf. I also wanted more smut! Can't believe I'm admitting this but I did. It's NOT something bad just a wish because i loved them together a lot. But nothing major is better than cringy ones (no I don't mean another author and you probably know who).I recommend this book to everyone, especiallyThrone of GlassandUprootedfans. Before I read some reviews of this book, I thought I was the only one who saw similarities with Throne of Glass but I was not. I thinkSarah J. Maaswas inspired by Poison Study, both girls were in dungeons sentenced to death and had the opportunity to work for the ruler. But while ToG failed to deliver likable characters, especially heroines, Snyder created a lovable one. I also feel like I should mention that this book was written in2005. 2005, okay? Before all this YA? hype. And for Uprooted fans, one of my all-time favorite books, I just know that like it even though they don't have many similarities aside from the awesome characters.Now the hard part is continuing this series. This book was so good that it's hard for the sequel to match it but after reading many negative reviews even from the fans of the first book, I can't help but feel hesitant to continue it. I will, of course, read the next two books and soon but I'm expecting something bad so*fingers crossed*.This book can be read as a stand-alone, as in the story develops and the main issue at the time is resolved, we don't have a cliffhanger but of course, the story didn't end here.PS:Don't read this book if you have finals or you're so busy. I did. And I read in one sitting. One more page became one more chapter until I was finally done. And I didn't want to finish it. And I didn't study that day although the exam was two days later.

Powerless,"an editor! an editor! my kingdom for a f*cking editor!(no kingdoms were harmed in the making of this review)˚✩ ⋆｡˚ ✩i am what some sexist pigs would call a basic b*tch. if you give me a tall, dark-haired, sarcastic, morally-grey guy in a romantasy that combines some of my favourite books and tropes -whilst still keeping some sense of originality, i'll be content.this book had all of that. (well, the tall-dark-haired-mmc-in-a-romantasy part)excluding the originality. (and the morally-grey part but i’ll get to that)lauren said powerless was “if the child of the hunger games and red queen didn't look anything like its parents.”…see, if that were true, then this review wouldn’t exist.(and i know i’m the myopic b*itch of the prime meridian, but this was exactly like it’s parents, as well shatter me and the selection)in fact, i was so angry about it, that i made a whole list. and then other people helped me add more to the list, and then, i realised that this wasn’t really an unpopular opinion at all.but before i get into all the ways this book was unoriginal, i’m going to criticise everything else. and if you don’t want to read about that,then scroll away.do not throw a tantrum in the comment section because someone expressed their criticisms about a book that you enjoyed. it’s incredibly immature, and quite franklyhilariousstupid because you’re wasting your time writing a comment that i’m just going to deleteafter screenshotting it and sending it on the group chat.anyway, let’s talk about something that actually wasn’t criticised that much: the writing.for a debut novel, it wasn’t that bad. for a book hyped up to the point where it could be mistaken as the greatest literary masterpiece this generation could ever bear witness to, it was trash.it read like an unedited draft that was both half-finished and yet too long at the same time, with the typos only making it worse. every sentence was so long-winded with synonyms upon synonyms being thrown into one sentence so whilst it might sound like this deeply thought-out didactic monologue about how inflation has affected the economy to the point that shakespeare's sonnets are no longer analysed correctly, it’s really just a horny teenage boy trying to sound edgy.and serious question: have recent authors heard of show not tell? i am not an idiot incapable of coming to my own conclusions, thank you very much. i don’t need to be told about just how morally questionable princekrabskai is, when i should just be able toinferfrom what the authorimplies. except the author didn't imply anything, for f*ck's sake this dude barely killed anyone.on top of that, the sheer amount of times i read “blue eyes”, “smoky eyes”, “ocean eyes” was enough to put me off reading forever. billie eilish is crying through her “aquamarine orbs” right now. and the amount of times these characters were huffing and puffing - for the love of all that is holy, use!!an!!inhaler!! someone’s lips were always twitching into a smile, or someone was snorting/ chuckling/ blinking/ eyeing something or someone, or paedyn was being called “vicious little thing” by kai - which only succeeded in me receiving fourth wing flashbacks. kai was always flicking paedyn’s nose for no given reason, and one or the other was constantly in a “throng of people”. plus, the inner monologues were also the most repetitive things i have ever read which really helped make the book incredibly long and boring, with the pacing losing to a snail in a 500m run. it’s filled with so much banter and such eye-rolling dialogue that after a certain point, you begin to wonder how on earth the mcs would cope without hearing themselves speak, as well as so many trope-centred and pointless scenes.if you don’t believe me yet, screw you and read this list of tropes:knife/dagger/arrow to the throat (every other page), enemies to lovers (not on a single page), insta lust, slow burn, who did this to you, she's so smol, forbidden romance, cleaning each other’s wounds, comforting after a nightmare, the most unnecessary love triangle (only one love interest has a pov), some stupid trials that have no history and don’t even make sense, and the street thief trope (cue the eyeroll - i’m probably an outlier on this one, but i just hate how much the street thief trope has been overused. there was no way paedyn would have survived a day on the streets with the amount of stupid sh*t that she pulled. did no one notice her wonderfully-amazing-most-gorgeous-beautiful-stunning-oh-so-rare-never-seen-before hair colour while she was off pickpocketing the rich? i’m very sure no one did, seeing as it wasn’t mentioned on every.other.page.)now it's time for more stupid things.. so many stupid things. so many. and i’ve actually missed a lot so if you can remember anything i’m missing please let me know <3➳ a trained soldier is dancing in the middle of a deathly arena because he likes a girl - mhm wow what a great idea, it's totally not going to get your dumb ass killed. aaand now they’re playing thumb war. sorry are we sure this dude is the future enforcer?➳“what i should have done was laugh in his face before making him go down the staircase first, but i’ve thrown caution to the wind and hastily replaced it with curiosity.”yeahhh great idea, go down a dark, damp, dank, dirty, dusty, secret stairway with a guy you're not even sure you should trust. greaaat idea!!➳“it’s really quite simple,” calum says. “the majority of us will finally all gather together, and we’ll show the people of ilya who we are and what we have to say. show them that we are not a threat while also reminding them of who they have been killing for decades. the king is going to have to either admit his lies about the ordinaries or simply give us our freedom. and you are going to help us do it.”ahhh yess so simple - it totally won't lead to a bunch of deaths, lies, revelations,andanother book.➳“i can practically hear sadie blink behind me. she’s clearly stunned by his lack of concern, especially after seeing the two of us dancing together only minutes ago. i would be stunned myself if i wasn’t so used to seeing his masks—if i didn’t recognize the cold one he’s just slipped on.”every.romantasy.ever becauseGOD FORBID A MAN SHOW HIS FEELINGS➳“yes, we are opponents. yes, i am the future enforcer. yes, I’m a killer that has no right to want to keep her. but there is something else, something that has her refusing to admit this confusing connection we share.”wannabe mafia lord who?➳“something begins burning inside of me, but I ignore it, not bothering to acknowledge the jealousy painting me Ilya’s kingdom color.”i- ..no comment➳ oh, but little miss paedyn gray over here was no better. every part about her needed a special mention (or two). even her ass!“as soon as my ass got numb from sitting on that bloody stump, i stood and paced circles around our camp before splashing cold water from the creek on my face and body. then my ass got cold, and i moved next to the fire to lie down on the hard ground i’m so familiar with.”narcissism who?? this was my daily reminder as to why fictional ya books don’t include the part where they have to deal with bodily functions out in the wild.➳ and in regards to the trials aspect,it had no real point.our only explanation was that the elites were being killed off in an arena to display their oh-so-original powers despite us constantly being that the elites' lives were more valuable. what the f*ck?? someone introduce this author to world-building immediately. it would have been much more understandable if it were all the ordinaries to battle to the death, (despite this already drawing a lot from the hunger games) and then you get your one oh-so-precious girl who goes through a makeover, has two guys lusting after her yada yada yada [insert all your favourite 2010 dystopian references here]. i honestly wouldn’t have even minded it, and i would have eaten it up immediately.➳ if anyone is interested in more of my points, i wrote a very long paragraph in message 192 on page 4 of the comments section below. it's also one of the many pages where you can find me breaking my promise to myself to not respond to idiots on the internetmoving on, let’s go back to paedyn seeing as my love for her runs so deep!she’s katniss’s not-like-other-girls cousin who decides to insult the f*ck out of you the minute you’re stood in a 2-mile radius to any guy. i wanted to claw her eyes out when she began with her “play the part sh*t” - which i’m pretty sure was ripping off the selection, which starred our just as talented, just as flawless america singer!, who by the way is a singer. from the dollar tree.ANYWAY, according to this very unbiased book, miss paypal over here had exactly 0 flaws. her only weakness was her infinite love for others, which was clearly evidenced when her seamstress friend is introduced yet barely ever mentioned. when our “darling” pae finally realises that she forgot about her after she was whisked away to the palace to become a princess overnight, she has the audacity to ignore her the entire time because she's too busy fawning over prince kahoot. *sigh* don’t you just love our 2012 wattpad heroine!now for prince krabs! yay! honestly he was the funniest character in the bookby far. his lines weren’t just cheesy and cringey, they were downright stupid too! he really is the whole package *swoons*he was as bland as unseasoned chicken. and annoying. very annoying. the only thing he ever managed to kill was my sanity. he’s also managed to ruin the word “darling” for me forever, which is yk, great. morally-grey my ass, he's a walmart kaz (insulting to kaz but still). he has no true redeeming qualities, and for that reason i quite frankly believe that him and pea-brain really deserve each other!(iwasgoing to do a section on the side-characters, but considering the amount of brain cells i have already lost just by recounting the so-called “personalities” of the two love-birds above, i don’t think that will be the best thing to do right now. however, when i figure out how to regenerate my axons and dendrites, i will be back.)˚✩ ⋆｡˚ ✩after this rather long paragraph ends, there will be tons of spoilers for the selection series (which i don’t recommend reading), the red queen (didn’t love it, didn’t hate it, just indifferent), the hunger games (if you haven’t read this yet, then what the hell are you doing with your life?), and a few mentions of the shatter me series (which is regarded by some as the greatest piece of literature and by others - me - as the greatest piece of dog sh*t that was dropped into this world), the darkest mind series (i’ve never read it), and the jasad heir (i enjoyed it). if you don’t want to be spoiled (although not all the similarities are spoilers, i just couldn't be asked to mark the ones that are) then you can skip to the bottom of this review where you will see a funny gif i found that pretty much sums up my personal experience with powerless.update:there is now a bonus section at the end (before the funny gif) with books that are similar/give the same vibes as powerless. note: i have not read all of these so please don't kill me if i'm wrong about any. if you have any info you want me to add then leave me a comment/dmyes, i realise that i have missed out on so many herethe selection:➳illéailya➳ a girl from the slums and from an undesirable position in society that rose up in the ranks➳ our fmc has different colour dress to everyone else➳ all the scenes where they're eating food➳ the queen likes the dancing in the balls➳ the balls➳ the safe room stuff that i’m not asked to go into detail about➳ the girl on girl hate -

Lightlark,"Update: I was kindly given access to an audiobook on NetGalley and can now divulge a full, honest review! Fair warning, I was right about this being an ACOTAR ripoff with terrible prose. I feel thoroughly validated lmaoAre you ever so nosy that you willingly invest $16.99 in a pre-order sale? Because yeah, that's how we've ended up here. Giving me adult money was a mistake.Anyhow, I have been lurking on Alex Aster's success story for a while now because it's remarkable how well she's marketed her book. From BookTok to a 6 figure deal and an impressive following, Aster has likely secured herself a spot on every bestseller list. It's commendable, genuinely, I am impressed with how she and her team have generated hype for this book. So much, that I was willing to pre-order and receive the 5 free chapters. Read all 52 pages in one sitting.I have thoughts.This book has been touted as this Hunger Games x ACOTAR fantasy and I need y'all to manage those expectations because the writing makes it plainly obvious that this book is a debut. In fact, the writing comes off as a second draft that would have benefitted from closer editing:""The snow villages of the Moonling new lands. The airy jubilees of the Skyling newlands. A few lands that hadn't been settled by any of the six realms at all.""A lot of the story (from what I read) relies on telling rather than showing and it leads to a lot of info dump so far. We are told that there were six realms, with six respective rulers, and six specific curses. We are told that Isla had a restricted childhood, who the perceived villains are, how the curses impact the different realms...And the funny thing is that even with all this telling, the world-building is very confusing. From what I've gathered, there are 6 realms and the realms are countries?? Isla mentions there are uninhabited countries that she could escape to, but the focus is on the Wilding, Skyling, Moonling, Starling, Nightshade and Lightlark. We are told that Lightlark is an island that appears every 100 years, but it was also at war with Nightshade; but then we are also told that Lightlark was inhabited with people from the other 4 countries (Wilding, Skyling, Moonling, Starling) but then the rulers of the realm got killed after getting cursed - and everyone thinks Nightshade is responsible for the curses? Am I losing anyone yet??? These 6 rulers are supposed to compete in a 100-day game/battle called the Centennial in which one of them must die - note, this system hasn't worked in the past 400 years, but they still keep doing the Centennial because...reasons.I feel like the author just made the rules very convoluted and hard to follow without the logic that we saw in the Hunger Games. For instance, in the Hunger Games, we understood that children were selected as a way to lower morale in the districts; in Lightlark, the rulers are selected...but they have been competing for 400 years (Isla is the youngest realm ruler while the others are like 500 years old lmao) so I don't get what's different about each time? In the Hunger Games, the competitors are sent to the Capitol; in Lightlark they are sent to Lightlark, the original realm with power, but also the King of Lightlark is cursed so does he also compete? In the Hunger Games, Katniss and Peeta meet with fashion designers to demonstrate how the Capitol demands pomp behind the tragic killing; in Lightlark, Isla has an appointment with the tailor...just because? I'm not sharing these parallels to demand the author make a carbon copy of the Hunger Games, but if you are gonna comp with such an iconic YA dystopia, you need to follow through.(Also this is a minor thing but from the character reveals we've had so far and the general Eurocentric fantasy world vibes, I'm sensing the book is gonna be very white/white-passing. I know Aster is Colombian so I give her kudos for being a WOC author in such a difficult industry. But I also can't deny that she is very white-passing and that does play a role in the diversity we might see in this book.)We are told that Isla feels dread, that her people are dying, but I never felt an urgency in the atmosphere of the story. The fact that Isla has time to go on a chocolate-eating date with one of the other realm rulers makes me doubt the stakes of the Centennial.SPEAKING OF DATE, y'all...the ACOTAR really jumped out. Remember when I mentioned the 6 realms, let me repeat them for you: Wildling, Skyling, Moonling, Starling, Nightshade, and Lightlark. If there's a villain (as the author has heavily hinted at ""villain gets the girl"") guess where he's from. Let me make it worse, his name isGrimshawLMAOOO.""The face belonging to the man looking down at her was amused. And familiar, somehow. He was so tall Isla had to tilt her chin to meet his eyes, black as coal. His hair spilled ink across his pale forehead. Nightshade, no question. Which meant...""Thank you Grimshaw,"" Isla said firmly.""Might as well have stuck a""Hello, Isla darling""in that introduction because that character is literally Rhysand in a different font. Tell me I'm wrong! You may argue that 5 chapters aren't enough to get a read on a character but all of the characters lack depth, most of all our main character Isla. She's also very inconsistent. Isla is supposed to be trained in battle/swordplay but she almost trips off a cliff, then she always falls over a balcony because the sound of someone's clapping startled her. She is supposed to have been isolated her whole life, but she's also very good at reading people (you can argue that she snuck out of her room using the Starstick so she's well-traveled, but I would think her personality would have traces of her anti-social, subdued/secluded background, though she is certainly naive).I can already predict that Grimshaw and Isla are endgame. Apparently, there are all these plot twists in the end so I would wager Grim betrays her for savior reasons and the next two books are about them being enemies to lovers. I also bet that Isla's second love interest is the King of Lightlark. The curses resulted from something between the Lightlark and Nightshade realms, or maybe from all the rulers contributing, idk I'm trying to guess at what would be so good that people are raving about the last 30 pages...maybe Isla's mom and dad had some kind of hand in the curses?? I mean I'm gonna find out in a month since I've preordered the book so we'll see if I was right.Okay let's pick up since I got an ARC. Oh boy. So much to unpack.Last time I wrote this, I was up to the start of the Centennial. Now my thing about the Centennial is that it's the dumbest concept despite instigating the sequences of events in this book. It's 100 days but in the first 50 days, all the rulers have to do demonstrations for the people of Lightlark to observe. It's supposed to be like the training days in the Hunger Games where the tributes show off their skills to secure donors during the games but the idea falls flat in Lightlark because the people who live on Lightlark don't...do anything. They watch? They attend parties? But their role is so unnecessary. Another component of these demonstrations is for rulers to scope out each other's powers but the ""winning"" isn't always straightforward. For Grim's demonstration, everyone had to battle it out, but the King of Lightlark, Oro, had a demonstration where everyone had the chance to show their greatest secret. Like?? Oro ends up being the winner of these demonstrations and is allowed to choose who to pair up for the next 75 days.Oh right let me break down this timeline: 100 days on Lightlark; can't kill anyone until after the 50th day. By day 25 or 50 (I think) the rulers pair up to solve the prophecy to break their curses. It's so dumb this entire book is about searching for relics. First Isla and the Starling ruler, Celeste, are searching for this thing called the Bond Breaker, then Isla and Oro are searching for the heart of Lightlark. I think day 50 also has some kind of banquet while day 75 has a carnival event? Genuinely, none of the things that happen are important; it feels like Aster is trying to contrive situations where Isla can be hot (in a revealing dress), fierce (holding a knife to someone's throat), or whatever.This feels like a good place to talk about how Aster has weird anti-woman, slut-shaming sentiments in the book. All of Wildling is described as being warrior women temptresses. Their curse is that they have to eat the heart of the ones they fall in love with (and they need to eat a heart every month...because reasons?) Anyways, Isla is supposed to go into the Centennial to seduce the king of Lightlark but she's so morally pure, she could never seduce someone - wearing tight clothes for her perfect body stresses her out! She's nothing like her realm (she also doesn't have powers because her dad killed her mom out of madness since her mom refused to kill him. Others have pointed out that this feels like a cop out where Isla can fall in love with both Grim and Oro and get this love triangle going). I also have to mention that Isla is fixated on Cleo (the Moonling ruler) being this evil villain; all of Cleo's interactions with her come off so cartoony. She's building a whole armada in Moonling and we never find out why. The final villain is also a woman with motivations that are so cliche (she cast the curses by accident while trying to get revenge on Oro's brother for not marrying her and falling in love with one of Isla's Wildling ancestors).I think it's kind of funny that Aster is touting the 6 overlay campaign with the 6 realm rulers because Isla never has a conversation with anyone beyond Grim, Oro, and Celeste. Azul (the only Black character...who is also named after a color...giving Topaz vibes a la From Blood and Ash), never has a one-on-one conversation with Isla. She finds out from Oro that Azul is mourning the loss of his husband but we never get more depth into his character. It's beyond annoying that Isla only has scenes with her two love interests or her friend who [SPOILER] turns out to be the main villain after all. Isla literally ends this book with two love interests and a vague, unfounded dislike for Cleo.But I digress. Where were we? Right, the stupid demonstrations, the endless chapters of Isla's searching, and then Act 2 is where we have Isla paired up with Oro. You would think, the time they spend paired up would give insight into Oro's character. Nope. Nuh-uh, friends, his character is so bland.To be fair, all of them are:-Oro(angry blonde hot guy with sun powers)-Grim(bootleg Rhysand - seriously, he comes from anight themed realm/courtand can read minds - but somehow, 13239x creepier. Every time he's mentioned he's ""raking his eyes over Isla's scantily clad body."" Not at all swoony. I would not trust this man to hold my drink.)-Azul(token gay & Black character - a two for one - who does nothing for the plot. Is actually off screen for 67% of the book. ACOTAR equivalent is Tarquin but without the personality.)-Cleo(bitch queen with vague water powers? #BiRep from one throwaway line)-Celeste(Isla's bestie with star powers. Very magical anime girl until she isn't)Isla rounds out all of them by being the ultra-pure, morally-pure realm ruler who is devastatingly beautiful, well versed in swordplay and battle, and if you thought she was unique for not having any powers, buckle up because the plot twist is that she has powers from not just Wildling but Nightshade as well. Oh right [SPOILER] her dad was a Nightshade.I am so terrible at this, I keep getting off track. It's because I'm writing this like 3 weeks after finishing this book during which I did everything I could to forget this asinine world and its equally dumb characters. But the summary of this book is so easy to break down: Demonstrations finish, Oro wins. Oro picks which rulers are paired together, he pairs himself with Isla (despite her and Celeste wanting to be paired together). He tells Isla that the way to stop the curses is to find the Heart of Lightlark, which is a plant. And she's supposed to be the plant ruler, so yeah. Act 2 is him and Isla just searching for this heart, with guest appearances by Grim telling Isla he's amonster who can't be lovedor some bullshit. Oro gets Isla to tell him her secret then betrays her and teams up with Cleo, then he turns away and says he did it to search Moonling without raising Cleo's suspicions. I really think that dumb plot point was so Grim could swoop and be Isla's confidante while she was mopey about the King. You would think his betrayal would trigger a new series of events and change the trajectory of the story but no. Like three chapters later, Oro and Isla make up, and then out of nowhere she's like ""OH, I KNOW WHERE THE HEART IS.""DRUMROLL: the heart is an egg. Like an egg in the sky?? And it can be grabbed at daybreak?? I really don't know by that point I was numbed. Defeated, if you will, because this world-building is just vibes, 12-year-olds on Wattpad do more justice with their setting and prose. Isla goes to grab the egg and then she gets shot and Grim has to save her. On the world-building point, there's legit entire other species living on Lightlark, which I don't think is addressed at all in the marketing. Oro mentions these Ancient Ones and then he and Isla meet with like ""winged people"" ($50 it's some variation of the Illyrians from ACOTAR). There's also this entirely other faction of Wildlings who don't eat hearts living in Lightlark called the ""Vinterlands"" or something, I was on the audiobook and idk the spelling, but they shoot her for getting the heart. But we never address that in the aftermath?? Like Isla gets shot, wakes up to Grim sniveling over the idea of losing her, then she and Oro discuss which realm ruler needs to be killed now that they have the heart. I feel like the prophecy is also so dumb because someone must die because...reasons.The book ends with Celeste revealing that she's actually Aurora the original curse caster who's been shapeshifting all this time. (Sidenote: in addition to their realm's powers some people have a super secret additional ability called a Flair. Watch Isla get a damned Flair in book 2). Celeste/Aurora has been manipulating Isla to find this thing called the Bond Break because she wanted to absorb all the powers of the realms. She can do that because in this world if people fall in love, you can access your significant other's powers...yeah...it read as stupidly in the book as it reads in this review. No surprise that this plan works because both Oro and Grim are in love with Isla. But then Isla unlocks somethinginside herselfand it turns out she's had powers all along but her guardians have been hiding it because Aurora threatened them. She defeats Celeste and banishes Grim.Why is Grim making a Rhysand-esque exit? Well you see, Isla had been using her starstick to teleport to all these places and one of them happened to be Nightshade. A year before the Centennial, she and Grim actually had a very passionate love affair but he erased her memories because he and Celeste wanted to take down Oro (because reasons) and they thought the best way to do that would be having Isla seduce Oro (despite her repeatedly expressing to the reader that she doesn't have a seductive bone in her body). Of course, Isla is heartbroken and super distressed by all this information and he really seals in his charm by sending her a creepy mind message that's like:you will come back to me!I'm telling you this character is so fucking weird, there isnothingintriguing or hot about his obsession with her. Not to mention his plan was the most contrived thing?? Why did he think it was a good idea to set his supposed love with his enemy??? Where is the logic??? Of course, Isla is gonna dump your sorry ass, you 500-year-old Grandpa!!!So yeah that's where we leave off, Isla with Oro but deeplytraumatized, which leaves everything perfectly set up for the ACOMAF sequence in Lightlark 2 (where Grim comes to swoop in and save her from the broody blonde man). Going back to my earlier predictions, I'm pretty pleased that I clocked the following:- Isla saved Lightlark (obvs)- Both Oro and Grim fall in love with her (duh)- Isla and Grim were past lovers in some sense- Grim was in bed with Aurora. Oh I didn't really talk about this but like, the whole reason Aurora/Celeste even managed to spin the curses was because she promised to sleep with Grim if he found her the heart of Lightlark. Yeah the heart that took Oro and Isla like 50 days to find?? Grim found it in one night in exchange for sexy times.- I also suspected Isla's dad was probably Nightshade so I'm glad Aster came through on predictability there.Final thoughts: this book is gonna do well on Booktok. It's literally catered to include everything people like on BookTok (enemies to lovers, women with swords, vague fantasy) but without any of the bite to deliver on those tropes. This whole thing reads like a first, maybe second draft and it's a shame that no one at any point stopped to say, ""let's go back and edit this"" because it has both juvenile prose and plot. Maybe the former could be forgiven for a debut, but the latter seriously makes this book unenjoyable. You never feel immersed in the book because the entire time, you have to stop yourself from rolling your eyes at how stupid everything is made to be. I know everyone is talking about how Aster falsely advertised a lot of scenes and I can confirm: there's very little overlap between what she's been promoting and what made it into the final copy; the villain doesn't even get the girl in the end?? My bigger gripe though is the injustice done to tokenized characters like Cleo and Azul, what's the point of diverse characters when you don't even engage with them? Isla being a woman of color would actually send me intomyvillain era, that girl is a slightly tanned Feyra variant at best, an Alex Aster self-insert at worst.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60310757-lightlark,Lightlark.txt
Perdido Street Station,"I Love You, I Love You, I Love YouFor the fortnight it took me to read this novel, I was in another world and I was in love.Perhaps, now, I’ll retreat from that world and substitute another or others (or perhaps even return to my own world), but I will remain in love.Is this a fantasy love or is it real? I think it’s real.After all, is there any love that is not partly a product of your own mind?How can a writer make this happen? How can a reader experience this? How can a person experience it in real life?SPOILER WARNINGThis is a sensitive review of some of the major themes of the novel. I have limited discussion of the plot, except to the extent necessary to discuss themes. I identify the antagonists, but not the process or outcome of the antagonism. Some readers feel there are spoilers.Is This the Real Life? Is This Just Fantasy?I read a lot of fantasy and science fiction in my teens, when I was working out my taste in literature.I had a fairly active fantasy life. Things happened in my family life that I wanted to escape, not by imagining that they didn’t happen, but by constructing my own world, my own reality, as a refuge, as a place where I could restore myself and heal.This world exercised my brain like a muscle, I exerted my mind, I did not fear difficulty or effort or rationality or emotion or imagination. Instead, these things were concrete materials that I used to self-construct the me that is I.They allowed me to dream, to aspire, to do and to succeed. And to relax and to manage stress.Maps and LegendsComputerised war games were not an option in my childhood. I had plastic soldiers, metal tanks and artillery, model airplanes complete with World War I flying aces. Our home was raised about 1.5 meters off the ground and I built fictitious worlds in the hard black dirt, hills and valleys carved out of the soil and compacted, islands, isthmuses and peninsulas in imaginary oceans.Battles raged on the ground and in the air. Cannons shot matches across the rugged terrain and took the lives of the infantry. Pilots in planes suspended from the bottom of the floorboards engaged in fierce dogfights, until one or other plunged into a hillside or the watery stillness of my imaginary ocean.I mapped these worlds in the days before Google Earth. I created atlases of warfare, I assembled maps and legends, I taught myself German Text, so I could fill each page with my dreams. I imagined “libraries fat with forgotten volumes”, and mine.I wanted to be an engineer, then a cartographer, finally a diplomat. I wanted to be a lover of the foreign and the exotic, a traveller, a go-between, a communicator, an advocate, a negotiator, a master of the opening gambit, a player of trump cards, an unraveller of puzzles, a solver of problems, a snorter of diplomatic corps quality cocaine, a smoker of peace pipes, someone who might be remembered for bringing two disparate peoples (or people) together.Ultimately, I did not need fantasy literature, because I was my own fantasy and I created my own fantasy world. I drew my own map and I was my own legend.Fantasy fiction and science fiction moved on without me, while I discovered literature that helped me understand people, relationships, the world we live in.The closest I have got to fantasy recently has been the works of Haruki Murakami. I think I’m passionate about his novels, because they deal with the real world, almost by using fantasy as a way of seeing, a method of perception, an instrument to detect, dissect and comprehend.Then, China Mieville appeared on the horizon and rocketed into the relative security of my world like a V2 from “Gravity’s Rainbow”.“Perdido Street Station” (“PSS”) sat on my shelf unread for a few years, even after I read and enjoyed “The City and the City”.When Traveller started a Discussion group on CM’s works, I decided that now was the time to bite the bullet and find out what CM was really about.I realised, then , that I was falling in love.”What Trick of Topography Is This?What did CM do to make me fall so?Let me try to tell you as best I can…PSS is first and foremost the tale of a city, of New Crobuzon. (I still have to pronounce this word carefully. I have never spoken it to a person in real life. Even now I mouth it hesitantly.)It sits astride the confluence of two rivers, the Tar and the Canker, which join to form one, the waters from the two retained, but somehow transformed, almost dialectically, into the River Gross Tar.New Crobuzon is an Industrial Age City-State Republic. It teems with people, beings, trade, commerce, ideas, ambitions, success, failure, suffering and misery.It teeters at some tipping point where just a nudge could bring the entire structure collapsing down like Einsturzende Altbauten.And, surely, some peril does emerge to give it that nudge, but cometh the time, cometh the man.Only in CM’s hands, it is not just cometh the man, it is cometh the man and the woman (women actually).They are not your common or garden variety heroes (just as the antagonists are not common or garden variety moths).They are an indie “band a parte”, in a Godardian or Tarantino-esque sense. You could almost call them a “motley crew”, except that CM has reserved that name for one of the principal antagonists.They are a ragamuffin bunch of outcasts with outré taste (1).(1) Outre:(a) Out of the common course or limits; extravagant;(b} Bizarre; outlandish (as in, an outré costume)Example:My first mental development had in it much of the uncommon - even much of the outré.- Edgar Allan Poe.Boys and Girls Own AdventureEven as I write this, I realise that PSS contains something of Charles Dickens, British Imperial adventure stories (especially tales of Biggles and his various sorties), pulp fiction, B-movies, French originals, Hollywood re-makes and cheap Italian rip-offs.To quote critic Don D'Ammassa from the Introduction to the “Encyclopedia of Adventure Fiction” (thank you Wiki):”An adventure is an event or series of events that happens outside the course of the protagonist's ordinary life, usually accompanied by danger, often by physical action.“Adventure stories almost always move quickly, and the pace of the plot is at least as important as characterization, setting and other elements of a creative work.”D'Ammassa argues that the element of danger must be the principalfocusof an adventure novel.For him, Charles Dickens' novel “A Tale of Two Cities” is an adventure novel because the protagonists are in constant danger of being imprisoned or killed.In contrast, “Great Expectations” is not, because ""Pip's encounter with the convict is an adventure, but that scene is only a device to advance the main plot, which is not truly an adventure.""While this distinction might be intellectually astute, I don’t really care to apply it to PSS.It is a stew with meat and vegetables. There would be no gain from an argument about what is principal or secondary.Suffice it to say that, what embarks from the intellectual platform later becomes a rollercoaster ride.A Fine, but Medieval, RomanceApart from the scientific and philosophical content, the other aspect of PSS that immediately appealed to me was the romance, especially the extent to which it was overtly erotic.Again, while trying to define the role of adventure in PSS, I stumbled across a discussion in Wiki, which helped me define my appreciation of the romance at the heart of the novel:” Adventure has been a common theme since the earliest days of written fiction. Indeed, the standard plot of medieval romances was a series of adventures.“Following a plot framework as old as Heliodorus, and so durable as to be still alive in Hollywood movies, a hero would undergo a first set of adventures before he met his lady. A separation would follow, with a second set of adventures leading to a final reunion.”That isn’t a bad summary of the plot of PSS at an abstract level.At the level of a medieval romance, there is a sense in which a knight errant (Isaac), portrayed as having heroic qualities (hmm), goes on a quest and experiences various marvel-filled adventures (hmm).Later, these types of stories were recast from an ironic, satiric or burlesque point of view (e.g., “Don Quixote”).It might be more accurate to place PSS within this later romantic tradition.Isaac is not exactly a hero, but he is not quite an anti-hero. He is a post-modern, fat bastard, nerdy, scientific Everyman, who rises to the occasion when he is called upon.There is a debate in the Discussion Group as to whether he is naïve, especially because he has eschewed a traditional academic career in order to pursue his more outré personal scientific vision.I wouldn’t call this naïve, though I would settle for idealistic, even if it requires him to get down, get his hands dirty and even get his clothes a little grubby.Strange Partners: The Curious Dance of the New Woman and the Imperial AdventurerI’ve borrowed this title from the name of a review by Teresa Mangum of the study, “New Woman and Colonial Adventure Fiction in Victorian Britain: Gender, Genre, Empire” by Lee Anne M. Richardson.If you’ll allow me to treat Isaac as an Imperial Adventurer, then Lin is the New Woman who enjoys a curious dance with him.It’s not just curious because of their moves, but because of their physical make-up.New Crobuzon doesn’t just consist of human forms, it consists of multiple sentient life forms, many of which have characteristics associated with ancient religions and mythology.Lin is a Khepri with a female body and a scarab beetle head.She is an artist with an outré taste and sensibility, while Isaac is the outcast scientist who falls in love with her, even though this is perceived as a socially taboo transgression.Needless to say, there is not just love, but a smorgasbord of sensory pleasures including sight, scent, taste, touch, lust and pleasure sex, notwithstanding the partial physiological incompatibility.Some readers seem to be grossed out by this physical challenge. I felt it highlighted the authenticity of their love. I found the relationship convincing and highly erotically charged.While I’m not widely read in the field of erotica and pornography, CM’s vision of this relationship really turned me on.It would take a great writer to write scenes of affection and delight that appealed to me as much as those featuring Lin and Isaac.MothroticaHaving said that, CM replicates the erotic charge in his description of the principal antagonists in the novel.The threat to New Crobuzon comes from giant slake-moths that feed on dreams.We see them transform through their life cycle from larva to pupa to adulthood, from caterpillar to cocoon to moth.During pupation, the larval structures of the moth are broken down, while the adult structures are formed.The pupa is inactive and usually static and sessile (unable to move about).They derive sustenance from the psychic energy of the non-rational part of the mind of those around them. They suck out the dreams of the inhabitants of New Crobuzon and leave them mindless and mute.Feeding is described in almost sexual terms, but having fed, the slake-moths become sexually active and fertile, they fly around, looping, falling, stroking, touching, arousing, copulating…juicily, ardently, ecstatically.This is gross, even though CM uses the same language he would use for Lin and Isaac.It’s worse when you know that slake-moths are “efficient, brilliant predators” and that they have no natural predators of their own.However, the juxtaposition of their non-sentient sexuality with that of Lin and Isaac makes me wonder why their sexual activity cannot be enjoyed, theoretically at least, to the same extent as other erotic behavior.The answer must be that it is just too remote from what we are used to, besides it might be the sentience that creates the proximity to human sexual response.As I’ve mentioned, even scarab beetle heads are too remote for some readers. There is a point at which sexual experience is too animal, and not sufficiently close to human sexuality to enjoy.However, CM at least asks us to contemplate sexuality, transgression and pleasure beyond what we are comfortable with.Rape as Social TransgressionI won’t mention their name out of a concern for spoilers, but one of the characters is suffering a punishment for a rape.While this act is offensive and illegal within our society, in the context in which it occurred, it is not punishable as a crime in its own right, but as an example of depriving a person of their right to choose.Thus, instead of rape being cast as an offence against the body, it is cast as an offence against the mind.It denies the freedom of the “victim” and limits their choice.The penalty might be the same or even higher. However, CM uses this conceptualization of the crime to test Isaac’s reaction to the punishment.Initially, he sympathises with the perpetrator and can’t understand the gravity of the crime.Then, when he translates the act from the apparently innocuous restriction of choice to physical rape, he starts to sympathise with the “victim”, Kar’uchai, who doesn’t want to be painted as a victim and simply asks Isaac to respect the laws of her society and the punishment it regards as appropriate.Kar’uchai counsels Isaac not to translate her society’s laws into his social context, but instead to appreciate them on their own terms.Ultimately, despite his affinity with his friend, Isaac elects to respect the law of her society, to respect its sovereignty, almost as if it was primarily an issue of international relations.Obviously, it is still a moral and criminal issue. However, Isaac accepts that each society has the right to define and enforce its own practices, customs and laws.It is not always appropriate, at least in the quasi-Victorian Steampunk era, to judge a society from the outside.Isaac’s “Principia Mothematica”Isaac has had a number of scientific interests during his career, including Unified Field Theory, where his allegiance is to Moving Theory rather than Static Theory.However, the interest most relevant to the battle with the slake-moths is crisis energy and his invention of a crisis engine.So what is crisis energy?This is major shit we’re dealing with here, mate, so…um…pay attention.1. We’re talking about the energy in matter such as an object.2. There are three types of energy: kinetic, potential and crisis.3. Kinetic energy is the energy the object possesses due to its motion.4. Potential energy is the energy the object has when it’s placed in a position, so that it’s teetering or about to change its state (e.g., you’ve lifted it up and are about to drop it).5. Crisis energy is the energy that is inside an object by virtue of its being or existence. It’s not necessarily there because it’s moving or because it’s been moved to a particular position. It’s there, because it’s already in the object, wherever it is or wherever it’s placed. There are incredible tensions within any object, no matter what its state. If it can be moved toward a state of crisis, a point when it is about to change its form or state (a transformation or transmogrification), the crisis energy will manifest itself, and can be tapped.Isaac’s goal is to tap or channel or harness crisis energy. If he succeeds, he will virtually have achieved a perpetual energy source and perpetual motion.He achieves his goal by constructing a crisis engine that can channel energy and amplify the output.Whereas Thomas Pynchon’s “Gravity’s Rainbow” is about entropy, PSS is about the exact opposite: the maximization of energy.The rest is secret. (I shouldn’t even have told you what’s above. I’m going to get into trouble with the Moderator General.)Ethical CleansingUltimately, it’s up to Isaac and his crisis engine to wage war on the slake-moths.Because everybody in New Crobuzon is threatened by the moths, various coalitions are proposed.Isaac’s best prospect comes from the Construct Council, which is a machine that is on the fringe of acquiring an artificial intelligence called “constructed intelligence”, a mechanical form of sentience. It’s just a calculating intelligence that is trying to “self-construct” or maximize itself, to ascend a hierarchy of intelligence.While he partners it, ultimately, he does not trust it totally, because it has no empathy or morals:”It'll do whatever it has to - it'll lie to us, it'll kill - to increase its power.”Whatever, he cannot let it have unrestricted access to the crisis engine. (Cue dramatic music.)Just as Isaac tried to take an objective ethical stance with respect to rape, he does the same with the war on the slake-moths.The Nectar of the SubconsciousThe slake-moths are dream eaters that prey on the subconscious. They detect and suck out hidden thoughts, guilty thoughts, anxieties, delights, dreams:""They drink the peculiar brew that results from self-reflexive thought, when the instincts and needs and desires and intuitions are folded in on themselves and we reflect on our thoughts and then reflect on the reflection, endlessly... Our thoughts ferment like the purest liquor...not the meat-calories slopping about in the brainpan, but the fine wine of sapience and sentience itself, the subconscious. Dreams.""They leave their victims mindless and imbecile.While calculating or thinking machines might be able to replicate rationality, they cannot replicate morality. They can replicate consciousness, but they cannot replicate a conscience:” I do not dream. I am a calculating machine that has calculated how to think. I do not dream. I have no neuroses, no hidden depths. My consciousness is a growing function of my processing power, not the baroque thing that sprouts from your mind, with its hidden rooms in attics and cellars.""”CM’s message seems to be that rationality is not enough to make us human. We need our passions and morality as well. We need our sentiments to be sentient. We need experience to be sapient.Isaac, the fat bastard outcast scientist has mastered reason, but it is not enough. He has stared the Enlightenment in the face and realized there is More Than This.Reason will allow us to peak through the keyhole, but if we want to open the doors of perception, we need more.The Transformation of LoveMuch of PSS is concerned with transformation, transgression and translation, the movement from one state to another.Lin is caught in a “bastard zone”, Motley is trapped in a “ruptured moment”.Perhaps, love is the drug, the remedy that is required.The romantic in me wants to believe that CM regards love as a raptured moment that will stand in opposition to or on the shoulders of pure reason.The relationship between Lin and Isaac is a clue to the transformation he thinks might be required.Their love, transgressive as it might be, consists of “filthy and loving invitations” as well as “jokes and apologies and compliments and lust.”Lin longs “to come home every night to freshly mixed fruit salad and theatre tickets and sex.""Isaac would be content just to look into the eyes of his scarab queen and hear her ask, “How was it, treasure?”Some time during the night, they might even be heard to cry out, “I Love You, I Love You, I Love You.”It’s up to each of us to decide whether this is a love worth having.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68494.Perdido_Street_Station,Perdido Street Station.txt
A Dowry of Blood,"I don't enjoy writing bad reviews. It is, obviously, easier for a writer to make herself sound intelligent with a bad review than with a good one, which is most of the reason for my suspicion. Sneering at something implies that you're in a position to sneer from, but it doesn't require you to elaborate on what that position is, even to yourself. Increasingly, I get antsy around a certain cadence in prose—five-dollar words used imprecisely, snappy one-line paragraphs, paragraphs that make sweeping claims and hurry past providing examples—a cadence that seems aimed to stoke superiority, righteousness, and intellectual comfort. I get antsy because I've used that cadence, I've purposefully evoked those emotions, and I know that this is not a style that requires intellect or integrity in order to achieve an effect.Dowry of Blood is this kind of writing. I wish that fiction were a better home for this style than essays are, but it is a worse one. I generally enjoy being angry—to kvetch is an art (requiring entirely different skills from the sneering critique I describe above, I should add), and like most Jews I would consider myself socially lacking if I could not spontaneously improvise five tight minutes of stand-up comedy on the topic of Having Recently Had A Bad Time. I did not feel angry about this book. I felt sour and sad.The book pretends at darkness while flinching away from its own violence. It pretends at moral ambiguity while flinching away from that, too: it repeatedly passes off impurity of action for complexity of ethics, and temporarily felt shame for lived guilt. It pretends at intellectualism and poetics: it passes off “making reference to Christian beliefs” as the former and “use of Christian vocabulary” as the latter. Coming from a white person, this association is socially conservative and personally insulting.It pretends at being an exploration of abuse. This is the part where, if I were writing the sort of snappy rant that I might have written if I were really angry, I would say something like “Its thesis is that abuse is bad.” This would not really be fair—the book's thesis is that abuse is a verbal, emotional, financial, sexual, religious, and physical pattern of relationship behavior, containing honeymoon periods that give way to building tension and explosions, in which one person exercises control over another. This is true, which is why it is also the thesis of the Wikipedia page for “domestic violence”. But this sentence also is a little too pithy, and so let me say that the book feels less simplistic than immature. Every page is a breathless discovery—what happened waswrong!—a state of pure shock, pure abjection, pure innocence in a way which has nothing to do with either the heroine's sex life or her acts of violence against others (criminals, we are repeatedly reassured, a sentiment of shocking moral hollowness). Even the abuser's verbal abuse focuses entirely on the heroine's innocence: he decries her “obsession with justice”, her “moralism”, the fact that she is “charitable”, her desire to murder criminals rather than everyone, her piety. I am disappointed by this obsessive abjection, this obsessive innocence. I think it is dangerous.I'll move on to picking apart the book's craft, which will at least make me feel less helpless in the face of its general unsoundness.I'll begin by reworking a single sentence to let you know what we're dealing with. The narrator says “And as Magdalena wound her fingers around my wrists and covered my chest in hot kisses, calling me sister with that mischievous smile on her face, I couldn't help but wonder if I was being trained, too.” In the first instance, “wound” is not quite the right word—it's used for snakes, roads, and vines, and implies a coiling motion that fingers are not really capable of doing to wrists. In the second, I'm not sure why “chest” would be used rather than “breasts” in an erotic scene, since they rely very heavily on physical specificity for the reader to project into—is Magdalena kissing her entire torso from collarbone to waist? Third, Magdalena is described as taking three actions with her mouth at once (kissing, saying “sister”, smiling). This isn't impossible, exactly—presumably we are meant to understand that she does these things sequentially—but it's not good writing to put all three in one sentence and two in one clause. Fourth, “with that smile on her face” is a redundancy; we do not assume the smile is on her toenail. Fifth, “I couldn't help but wonder” is a sentence so deeply associated by meme with the television show Sex and the City that it belongs nowhere in a scene set in the year 1529, especially if what the narrator “couldn't help but wonder” is something about her relationship.On this last note there is really no attempt at historical voice in this book whatsoever. The prose is, of course, meant to be generally elevated—“Paris was happy,for a time”, “Shehad taken tolowering her voice”, “You always knew how to thaw my heart right whenI had resolved tofreeze it against you”. But these italicized phrases are not elevated or historically located by themselves. They are common in the prose of the nineteenth century, which is not the same. It is the equivalent of having American actors playing ancient Romans speak in upper-class British accents. In addition, they're inconsistent:right whenis intensely modern, located in a completely different register from the rest of the sentence. (Queerness, I should note, is present in this story but entirely unexplored. The narrator, a devout Christian born in the Middle Ages, never makes an attempt to reconcile her faith and her habitual extramarital queer sex—presumably because she is familiar with progressive American Christian discourse of the 2010s regarding Christ's accepting nature and therefore feels no need to revisit it in this book set over the course of the second millennium in Europe.)The heroine visits multiple cities over the course of the book. Vienna is described as “the seething, shouting mass of life outside my home”. Venice is described as “seething color and swirling masses of people” and “a whirl of color and sound”. Berlin is described as “minds all moving together in a great human sea”. Petrograd is described as “a swirling watercolor of browns and brass”. Paris is described as “a living, breathing thing, bursting at the seams”. A wharf is described as “noise and bustle swirling around us”. I genuinely don't feel that it's absurd to ask an author not to copy-paste her own descriptions.Metaphors include: “her dark eyes flashed like twin daggers”—I think the author would prefer “cut” rather than “flashed” for a dagger comparison, but perhaps she just did want any shiny object and daggers were sufficiently edgy, so to speak; “your mouth as close to my ear as the snake must have been to Eve in the garden”—to rely myself on an overused phrase, this metaphor is as subtle as a brick to the head; and my least favorite paragraph: “I was tired of being your Mary Magdalene... I was tired of groveling on my knees and washing blood off your heels with my hair and tears. I was tired of having the air sucked out of my lungs every time your eyes cut right to the heart of me.” I wish that the author had been this enthusiastic about naming specific body parts during the sex scenes. Mary Magdalene is not discussed in the story before this moment, nor afterward. The narrator has no personal connection with her other than being a generally pious person, but she identifies herself earlier in the story with Judith and with Jesus, rather than Mary Magdalene. I must also note again how deeply, deeply frustrated I am at the author's empty reliance on Christian imagery. The assumption appears to be that there is something so universal about Christian narrative and theology that every audience member will be highly familiar with them, deeply emotionally stirred by them, and recognize them instantly as the sign of an intellect that is deeper and more thoughtful than non-Christian intellects. This assumption is incorrect.The setting is painted on cardboard. I reference again the various “swirling masses” of the cities of Europe—no character is ever interested in leaving Europe, despite mentioning multiple incentives to do so—I need hardly tell you that no member of these “masses” is ever individuated or characterized. Every single object mentioned in descriptions is a plural: “all the new inventions flooding the scientific markets... lined up carefully on your worktables”, “crowded with blank canvases and half-constructed wooden frames”, “twenty or thirty members of the gentry” (“swirling around me”, of course). I was particularly struck by a room described with “Every detail, from the iron candle sconces on the wall to the brightly colored rugs underfoot, boggled my mind.” These are the only details of the room that we actually get. I think it is reasonable to ask to be more boggled than I currently am. There are very, very few actual scenes in this novel—nearly every single action is described in the imperfect past, rather than the preterite, which is hugely frustrating for those of us who enjoy seeing characters say dialogue or take actions.There is no sense that the world exists, is touchable, is real. Let me use a metaphor here of a Target: to a customer, a Target (or other big-box store) may be described as ""shelves lined with groceries and appliances"". To someone who has actually worked at a Target, it may be described as ""Home & Patio, Storage & Organization, three of the medium woven black baskets left and four of the XLs"". It is always worthwhile to try to snap out of looking at the world through the lens of a customer (though obviously it's understandable to do so if you are, in fact, shopping at Target today). It is lazy to look at the world through the lens of a big-box store customer if you are the inventor and builder of the imaginary Target. It is unacceptable to use the lens of a big-box store customer to describe five centuries of international travel and domestic life.This is a book which believes itself to be, and is being marketed as, courageous, erotic, dark, and above all intelligent. I don't enjoy writing bad reviews. I enjoy being bullshitted still less.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60521937-a-dowry-of-blood,A Dowry of Blood.txt
Gideon the Ninth,"""'We do bones, motherfucker,' she said.""So What's It About?""Brought up by unfriendly, ossifying nuns, ancient retainers, and countless skeletons, Gideon is ready to abandon a life of servitude and an afterlife as a reanimated corpse. She packs up her sword, her shoes, and her dirty magazines, and prepares to launch her daring escape. But her childhood nemesis won’t set her free without a service.Harrowhark Nonagesimus, Reverend Daughter of the Ninth House and bone witch extraordinaire, has been summoned into action. The Emperor has invited the heirs to each of his loyal Houses to a deadly trial of wits and skill. If Harrowhark succeeds she will be become an immortal, all-powerful servant of the Resurrection, but no necromancer can ascend without their cavalier. Without Gideon’s sword, Harrow will fail, and the Ninth House will die.Of course, some things are better left dead.""What I ThoughtI don't think this review will JUST be me raining onGideon the Ninth's parade, but there is definitely going to be some rain.  While it has a tremendously awesome premise and follows through brilliantly in a number of ways, there are still a lot of problems that took away from my enjoyment of the book as a whole.Put simply, there are some definite issues with pacing and world-building. While I was reading this book a friend on Goodreads posted an update about a third of the way through saying that nothing had really happened yet. Someone commented that hey, aesthetic (TM) was happening! To which my friend replied that it's possible to have plot and aesthetic happen at the same time. I couldn't agree more with that, and I definitely agree that very little happens in the first third of the book besides getting to the palace and learning bits and pieces about the cast of characters. Once the plot picks up it's great, but it leaves you with a significant portion of the book to slog through before getting there.My main concern, though, is the sparse world-building. There is so much we don't know about Gideon's world - for one, how exactly does the magic work? Occasionally a necromancer will make vague allusions to technical terms, but beyond the ability to draw power from other people I never felt like I understood what they were talking about. It's also a significant problem to me that we never really learn about the differences between each of the houses - they each have a little description in the front of the book, but I never felt like these differences were expanded upon in a meaningful way in the text. We know what the Ninth does, but nothing significant about the other houses.There are also a lot of characters in this book, too, and I'll admit that I struggled to keep track of all but a few of them and had apathetic feelings towards everyone except Gideon and Dulcinea. Many of the characters from other houses felt to me like they were just bodies to spout a few quippy lines and then turn up dead and eviscerated later. Maybe it's asking more than is fair to expect an author to deeply characterize the number of characters that appear in this book so I don't want to do that, necessarily - rather, I'll just note that sometimes the characterization that did happen fell flat to me and when you read it there may be lots of flipping to the front of the book to keep everyone straight.Another bone I have to pick (sorry I'm sorry) is related to the pop culture references that characters make over the course of the book. At one point Gideon quotes Mean Girls, and Harrow references the meme ""While you were X I was studying the blade."" ""That's what she said"" makes an appearance. I think this kind of humor may be something that you either love or hate and it decidedly wasn't for me.Overall, though,Gideon the Ninth's humor is one of its strongest suits. Gideon herself is a wonderful protagonist with an absolute intolerance for the necromancer's self-important nonsense and a delightful sense of humor:""'This calls for rigor, Nav.''Maybe rigor … mortis,' said Gideon, who assumed that puns were funny automatically.""I found myself smiling throughout most of the book just because I liked Gideon so much and found it to be such a treat to be inside her head. The other thing that this book absolutely nails is that aforementioned aesthetic, there is absolutely no denying that.  The setting is wonderfully ruined and decrepit, oppressive and mournful, and it's clear that necromancy is a fascinatingly grim business:“The unperceivable howl of ten thousand million unfed ghosts who will hear each echoed footstep as defilement. They would not even be satisfied if they tore you apart. The space beyond that door is profoundly haunted in ways I cannot say, and by means you won’t understand; and you may die by violence, or you may simply lose your soul.”Finally, as I mentioned previously, once the plot gets going it's an enjoyable murder mystery and builds to a fantastic, exciting conclusion.The blurb on the cover promises lesbian necromancers in space, and while that is technically what you get I can't say I was totally satisfied with the execution. Gideon's love for women is wonderfully written, but as for the romance/not-romance with Harrow, I just don't buy the growth from this:""If you do anything that suggests we’re out of order—if I even think you’re about to…” Here Harrow shrugged, quite calmly. “I’ll kill you.”to this:“I owe you your life,” said Harrowhark, “I owe you everything.”I've seen some people criticize the troubling power dynamic and general nastiness that goes down between the two of them (that is something that I myself originally criticized) but I now think it's fair to point out that fictional gay relationships are often held to really high levels of moral scrutiny while readers then turn around and coo over the week's latest negging boundary-crossing bad boy in a straight fictional relationship. I have read many reviews of this series that really appreciate how Muir writes messy, disastrous queer girls in messy, disastrous queer relationships. My current gripe isn't that it fails to be aspirational; it's just that I didn't really buy the emotional beats that did develop.I read a couple of reviews that argued that the ending of the book counts as Bury Your Gays, and I guess it's technically true that a gay couple(ish?) gets separated when one of them dies. HOWEVER, Bury Your Gays doesn't include every time a gay character dies in fiction - that the trope is specifically about outsider writers punishing gay characters, treating them as being more disposable than straight characters or exploiting their suffering. I don't think Muir does any of these things. If that doesn't convince you, I think there's also a place for queer creators to reclaim the tropes that have been used against them, which Tamsyn Muir talks about that inthisreally great interview. Alsooooo, since this is a story about necromancy I am 100% sure that there are going to be more shenanigans with this particular character in the next book.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42036538-gideon-the-ninth,Gideon the Ninth.txt
The Book Eaters,"“There is no happy ending to this story.”Book Eaterspresents itself asa mishmash of literary genres, blending elements of horror, fantasy, dystopia, parallel worlds, and feminist and anti-patriarchal themes—in short, a concoction crafted to cater to popular trends. However, my experience with the book left me profoundly disenchanted, to the extent that sleep eluded me until I addressed my grievances through this review. The sheer amalgamation of these popular tropes failed to resonate with me, and the result left me feeling frustrated and dissatisfied. I can recall feeling a similar level of intense disappointment only once before, upon completingThe Binding.Problem number one: the ideaThe fundamental flaw ofThe Book Eaterslies in itsintriguing yet underdeveloped premise. Paradoxically, it is about the only book about devouring books I read, where books have no inherent added value but are - on some subversive level - a liability, instead.The central concept ofbook-eating feels arbitrary and disconnected from the narrative, lacking any meaningful exploration or explanation within the story. This is particularly disappointing considering that the premise holds significant potential and is likely the primary draw for many readers. You need to be warned that the execution of this excellent idea falls flat.I cannot explain how frustrating it is to encountersuch a promising concept squandered by a lack of depth and coherence: The author introduces the idea of people consuming booksand mindswithout bothering to explain the origins, mechanisms, or implications of such behaviour. Instead of leveraging this fantastical element to explore themes of magic or science, societal consequences, or psychological intricacies,the main plotline involving book-eating often feels contrived and unconvincing, failing to establish a solid rationale for this phenomenon. At times, it even borders on the absurd; instead of understanding how people became bookeaters, the magic or science behind why they exist, how is it that they are faster and can see in the dark, why they seclude themselves from society in ghotic mansions and treat women in a suicidal way endangering the whole species’ survival, we learn that chalk paper tastes best with ketchup. Seriously?!The missed opportunities to imbue the story with substance and coherence and the failure to capitalise on the innovative premise ofThe Book Eatersresults in a narrative that feels shallow and unfulfilling.Problem number two: character developmentThe lack of development in the central concept ofThe Book Eatersextends to its characters, resulting in a cast that feels shallow and unconvincing. Devon, the main protagonist, emerges as particularly problematic, characterised bynaivety, denseness, and a startling one-dimensionality. Her identity seems restricted to her role as a mother, albeit a notably dysfunctional one. Thissingular personality trait her characterisation rests upon fails to lend her any depth or complexity, rendering her portrayal disappointingly flat.The portrayal of Devon’s fugitive existence exacerbates the narrative’s shortcomings,veering into grotesquenesswith its unnecessarily bleak and gruesome depiction. Many of thechallenges she faces could have been easily circumvented with even a modicum of intelligence, yet the narrative fails to provide her with the necessary agency or resourcefulness. Basic strategies such as forging fake IDs or navigating international borders as a an undocumented refugee are beyond her grasp, highlightinga frustrating lack of logic and coherencein the storytelling.Themodern setting only exacerbates these issues, as the depiction of familial dynamics and language usage feels jarringly out of place, evoking a Victorian rather than a contemporary reality. The inclusion of props such as motorcycles, video games, vodka, and mobile phones only serves to highlight the narrative’slack of cohesion and believability, further undermining its already tenuous foundation of the bookunderscoring the overall lack of attention to detail and internal consistency.Beyond Devon,the supporting characters fare no better, existing as little more than cardboard cutouts devoid of substance or significance. Even Devon’s son, ostensibly a pivotal figure in her life, serves merely as a plot convenience rather than an individual. Moreover, the interactions between characters feel stilted and artificial, characterised byflat dialogue and monotonous exchanges that fail to capture any sense of authenticity or emotional resonance(in plain English this means bad writing). The absence of meaningful character development further undermines the story’s credibility, which left me without anyone to truly connect with or relate to.Problem number three: the taleBeyond the surface-level exploration of patriarchal oppression,the narrative fails to offer any meaningful depth or complexity. Its predictability is evident in its overall plot trajectory, which adheres to a formulaic and uninspired course. Despite its seemingly solid construction,the story quickly grows derivative and tiresome—chapter in, chapter out—as it relies heavily on repetitive slogans and fails to introduce any genuine intrigue or originality. Also, please note, a paragraph about how a woman finds another woman attractive is not enough to make a queer identity book. What defines the identity of the MC, what drives her and her actions, is the fact that she is a mother, the fact that she also happened to be a lesbian is of secondary if not tentiary importance for the whole story!). In fact, the narrative’s banal portrayal of Christianity asa convenient scapegoat serves as a fitting encapsulation of its overall lack of depth and nuance.The story’s only redeeming quality would is the fact that is it told backward, slowly unraveling the secrets of its uninspired past. But alas, even that does not salvage its irredeemable mediocrity.Stay away.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58724745-the-book-eaters,The Book Eaters.txt
A Day of Fallen Night,"4.5/5Mother, we are your daughters. We remember. We remain.Samantha Shannon has done it once again! I enjoyedA Day of Fallen Nighteven more thanThe Priory of the Orange Tree, it was such an incredible read. In a book with such an epic scope it's hard to find a place to start when reviewing, but I will nevertheless attempt explaining how infatuated I am with this book in my mere words.First of all, the world. The world is unconquerable, Shannon's skill and immense love of history shines in every structured choice she made whilst creating it. It is lush forests and desolate plains, ravaged by the ice of the North and the sun of the South, it boasts so many fascinating geographies, civilisations, religions and cultures. It's a sweeping tale that spans the Grief of Ages (a timePrioryreaders will recognise from the world's history) with perspectives from all across it's vast map.Dumai is our perspective in the East. She's a godsinger on Mount Ipyeda, her world a world of snow, harsh winds and perilous climbs. She learns never to goad the mountain, to learn when to reach towards the sky and when to be mindful of the shifting ground beneath her feet. And, inevitably, this is the battle of Dumai's storyline; she is a kite meant to soar with the winds, yet she is tangled in the politics of a land she was not born to understand. She is a secret, she is a legacy, she is the whispering voice, she is the mountain climber, she is the wind, she is the godsinger.We are lead across the East as we fly beside her, spectators to her momentous story. From the mountains, to court, to journeys Dumai could never dream possible, we haunt her like water ghosts as we traverse the mysteries that lie inside her.Dumai holds engrossing relationships with all those around her, a devoted bond with her mother, a heart-warming friendship with Kanifa, a complex and entertaining relationship with the silver-tongued Nikeya. I adored every moment of her story, I think it was perfectly written.In The South, we are introduced to Tunuva, a sister of the Priory. Tunuva is an older character with many established relationships and memories of the past. She's a brilliant character, kind and loyal to a fault, always there and ready to protect her family. Ultimately, this is Tunuva's weakness, her love and gentle heart. Although she is a great warrior, faultless with a spear as she fights alongside her ichneumon, Ninuru, her heart holds her family above all else. Esbar and Siyu, the child in her past, and all her family in the Priory mean everything to her.I loved glimpsing more of the Priory itself and the people in it.Prioryreaders will recognise these characters as ancestors of ones we already know. It's a fascinating place to simply exist in, and I loved seeing more of the South. It was always riveting when we discovered places we have not yet been to in this world, as well as places that did not exist inPriorybecause of the changes throughout the world's history. The Republic of Carmentum was one of these compelling new discoveries.Through Tunuva we see the most siden magic, a magic of heat and day and fire. I have always adored the careful balance of this world's magic system and was delighted to see so much magic throughout the different perspectives.Wulf is our point of view in the North. He's such an engaging character, an intriguing man trying to escape the mysteries of his past. He serves as a warrior under King Bardholt, fighting against the rumours of the Haithwood, trying to be someone his family will be proud of. Wulf is also an incredibly loyal character, much like Tunuva, a fierce defender of those he loves, and a caring friend.His childhood friendship with Glorian slowly became one of my favourites. Although I cannot say too much about the plot of Wulf's story, know that it is enrapturing, never ceasing to elude and devour you.We trek the furthest in Wulf's perspective, seeing corners of the world we had not dared venture before. As I mentioned with the Republic of Carmentum, Hróth is another land we have not seen before, and (as a person who loves cold, icy lands) I treasured every moment inside of it. Hróth provided many unique obstacles and difficult terrain. It was a brilliant choice to establish so many varying geographies and cultures so that we could see how similar things affected each land differently and in which ways the lands each chose to combat them.As hard as it was to decide, as I adored every single character with all my heart, I eventually decided on a favourite. We find that favourite within our perspective in the West, Glorian Hraustr Berethnet. She is strong and iron-willed, clever and defiant. She is the shield of Inys.We know the long line of Berethnet queens fromPriory, but there are very few who compare to Glorian. We even know a piece of Glorian's story, from the history ofPriory, but there is still much that we do not know. Knowing this piece of her only draws tighter the chains that bind Glorian to her story, she grows evermore imprisoned as we read on and on. The role of queen is not one she desires, the eternal vine of Berethnets is not a destiny she wants to claim.Here, Shannon explores the most important storyline of them all. Here, Shannon (with her passion for women in history blazing brighter than any flame) explores monarchy through the lens of what women in monarchies were forced to endure and provide to continue these bloodlines. Here, Shannon is at her best.I could write essays upon essays just on this topic and how essential it is to be explored like this, but I fear I cannot without dragging huge spoilers from the depths of every part of this novel, so I won't. But know that it is done incredibly, with parallels that illustrate deeper these monstrosities, and profound moments that will wrench your heart from your chest.Glorian's story isthestory ofA Day of Fallen Nightfor me. As important and entertaining as all the others are, Glorian's story is indomitable.All of the characters are incredible, complex and alluring, and their plotlines are all captivating as they intertwine and parallel and subvert. UnlikePriory, you will be completely immersed in every single character's perspective as your love and adoration for each character only ever grows.We will all be stories one day, and I'd want someone to believe we existed.Shannon's writing is beautiful and efficient, it shows us each part of the world in lavish prose and clearly explains every action. You can tell how much her craft has improved, the very structure, the very bones of this story hold firmer as we move towards the end with a pace of perfection. It's a slower-paced, denser read thanPriory, however I believe it to be the more entertaining and engaging.A Day of Fallen Nightis a standalone prequel toThe Priory of the Orange Tree, you can read either one first. I would sayPrioryis the gentler read and is a softer introduction to the world, howeverADOFNis (in my opinion) the better of the two. It is truly such a brilliant read and I now love Samantha Shannon and the world ofPrioryeven more.Prioryis known as a sapphic fantasy staple, and I wholeheartedly agree with this. ButA Day of Fallen Nightboasts an even higher count of sapphic relationships, alongside it's other incredible representation. Out of our four main characters, two are sapphic, one is achillean, and one is aroace-spec. There are also several other queer characters as well as trans and genderqueer characters. Samantha Shannon could I possibly love you more?Let us give the world a reason to remember us.Thank you Netgalley and Bloomsbury Publishing for providing me with an e-arc in exchange for an honest review.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60766189-a-day-of-fallen-night,A Day of Fallen Night.txt
The Priory of the Orange Tree,"1 Star*A bloated, leaden behemoth lacking in any originality, character development, engaging plot, or good writing*If anyone compares this toThe Lord of the RingsorA Game of Thrones, throw this book at their heads. Maybe it will knock some sense into them.Ok, ok. I fully admit that I’m in a cranky mood, becauseI wasted so much time reading such an awful, boring, clichéd book.This is one of those cases where I wonder if I read the same book as everyone else did, because what I just read bears no resemblance to the book that people are gushing about.At the time of writing this review,The Priory of the Orange Treehas a 4.24 rating on Goodreads with 48% of those being five star ratings. Normally with a book this massive by an author I hadn’t read before, I would wait a bit and see if anyone other than hardcore fans thought it was worth the hype. But for some reason, I was sucked into the hype and the pretty cover and decided I needed to read it right away. It’s a story with dragons and magic and legends and female warriors and pirates and witches and lots of awesome-sounding stuff. I thought it sounded great!Obviously not my smartest moment.Ok, let’s break this down:SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL:Let’s start with the maps. The story is mostly split between the East and the West. There is a map for each. While at first glance the maps looked good, as I read the book, I became increasingly frustrated with the maps. Both maps run off the edges of the page with no clear indication of what lies beyond. There is no clear delineation of how the two maps relate to each other. The crests for each country float randomly on the edges of the page rather than being over the countries themselves. So if you took the map literally, all of those countries are under the sea. And the descriptions of the various countries and land features didn’t match well with the map. It was almost impossible to orient with the story. And for a story that spends a lot of time traveling and talking about multiple countries, this really crippled an already limping story.There is also supplemental material at the end which includes a list of characters, glossary, and timeline. The list of characters is somewhat helpful because there area tonof characters, and they’re too boring to keep track of. The glossary is also hit or miss in its helpfulness. For example, you’re really going to define “Wyvern” but not “Ichneumon”? The timeline is pretty much useless because it leaves off info to avoid spoilers for the plot.WRITING STYLE:The story itself switches between five main narrators who are mostly divided by whether they are in the East or the West. The narrative jumps between people within chapters, but at least it’s all told in third person.It’s written withYe olde Englishdialogue that feels corny and inconsistent. It is purposefully archaic at times but totally modern-sounding at others. The lines of dialogue feel like high schoolers trying to recite Shakespeare. It all felt so inorganic. Also, one random side note: there are a plethora of palanquins in this book. Despite taking place across different countries that are mostly cut off from each other, with different cultures and different terrains, nearly everyone in this story travels by palanquin. It makes no sense.CHARACTERS:Despite all of the allegedly exciting events, this is mostly a character-driven story. Andthe main characters are stiff and dull and tedious.The rest of the characters aren’t fleshed out and also lack personality. They pop up at opportune moments and pretty much cease to exist the rest of the time. And none of the characters react to their environment or situations authentically. They are stiff cardboard cutouts that only move when the author remembers to move them.Many people are callingThe Priory of the Orange Treea feminist version ofThe Lord of the RingsorA Game of Thrones. That’s total bullshit. The only thing they all have in common is being long with lots of characters. (I’ll add more about the alleged feminism later.) There is little else in common withThe Lord of the Rings. The comparison toA Game of Thronesmakes more sense. But only becauseThe Prioryis a total wannabe of theA Game of Thrones, not because they are anywhere near the same quality. They have similar medieval-esque settings in worlds where dragons and magic where once prevalent but are now mostly myth. They both have lots of characters. But there is a reason I always useGeorge R.R. Martinas a prime example of how character development should work. He is amazing at showing how the well-intentioned end up bad and how the evil can be redeemed. He writes complex characters with believable arcs, puts up genuine roadblocks, kills mercilessly, and leaves you constantly wondering who will prevail. Shannon tried to emulate that… and utterly failed at it. She was trying to be dark but didn’t have the guts. I think she just seems too nice to pull off any bloody machinations. Her evil laugh is probably a cute little giggle that doesn’t even make bunny slippers run for cover.The author’s previous books were all YA, and that shows. This writing very much felt like YA writing that the author tried to age up by killing some people and talking about nipples. This book elicited many eye rolls and snorts of derision from me. It might be better under the New Adult category since almost all of the characters are in their twenties and the story has an air of naiveté to it.WORLD-BUILDING:As shoddily as the characters were written, the world-building was worse. The story borrows bits and pieces from cultures and mythologies of Earth, but it feels like everything got thrown in a blender resulting in a messy hodgepodge that does not make sense. The worst part is how badly the world-building is relayed.This is one of the most awful examples of world-building I have ever read.History and myth are relayed clumsily, stiffly, and inorganically. One of the most common methods of relaying information is through inner monologue. There is one time when Character A asks Character B is she is familiar with a certain legend. Character B simply answers, “Yes,” then proceeds to inner monologue the whole legend! It was so bad! And nearly all of the background information was relayed like that – through dry info-dumps catapulted at random into the story.The narrative is so bogged down by information and filler descriptions that end up doing nothing other than adding to this book’s absurd length.Seriously, this book had no reason to be 830 pages long!If it isn’t lore added through dry monologues or longwinded descriptions of curtains then it’s background on the characters being stuffed into the story. It’s a whole of lot “Hello, Character C, whom I know through your position as Such and Such, and I am aware that you are a descendent of Don’t Care who did Blah Blah Blah waaaay back in the day.”PLOT:The sloppy world-building feeds into an underwhelming plot. Now, I knew the story had a slow start. Even many fans admitted that that the first 300 pages were slow. I didn’t realize that those people were seriously understating things!The first 300+ pages are bone-dry, dull, and unbelievably monotonous!It took memonthsto get through this book. And while the plot does finally manage to accelerate faster than a geriatric patient, it doesn’t speed up by much.The whole story lacks plausible threat and tension. There is more threat from political machinations than the “evil” dragons, but even that creates almost no suspense. It’s mostly senseless drama. There was never any doubt about how it would all end.There is so much wandering (fetch-quest style) and yet obstacles are removed with ridiculous ease. Over and over and over the charactersjust happento find the object they need, or some coincidence leads to their miraculous escape, or they arrive in a huge city and immediately find the one person they need to find. The entire plot is built upon these obnoxious coincidences. It removes any tension or suspense because you always know that another miracle is right around the corner.From the way people were weeping over this book and saying they were so devastated over the deaths… well, I thought some more people might die. Like, say, more of the many main characters perhaps? But without going into specific spoilers,the death toll in this book is absurdly low!Seriously, between the draconic creatures attacking, a supposedly incurable plague, warring nations, and betrayals from within, people should have been dropping like flies. Which circles back to my point about Shannon being too nice to murder her darlings.Remember all those exciting-sounding things I mentioned in the beginning? Well, they aretechnicallyin the book. But Shannon found a way to make dragons and magic and legends and female warriors and pirates and witches allmind-numbingly boring. For starters, the dragons are barely in the book! They are mostly there fordeus ex machina. Both good and bad dragons only pop up when the plot needs a big dose of fire to wake it up from its self-induced coma. And all those other exciting-sounding elements are barely present and/or so poorly described that it sucks all the excitement from them until nothing is left but dry, dull husks.Another huge weakness aboutThe Priory of the Orange Treeis the action. There hardly is any. And what little action does happen is horribly described! Shannon loses track of where characters and objects are within a scene. She totally relies on those lucky coincidences to resolve fights. All of the actions scenes are anticlimactic – particularly the end battle scene. But as poorly as the fighting is written, there are several more example of the author taking a complete copout, fading to black as soon as the fight starts, and then recapping it through boring dialogue after the fact! It was terrible!!THEMES:Religion is a major theme inThe Priory of the Orange Tree. The basis of the lore in this book revolves around various religions interpreting the same events in different ways and building their dogma around that. This theme had the potential to be insightful and powerful, but it was handled so poorly. So while the story borrowed from real-life conflicts, it did not bring anything perceptive or enlightening to the subject.Another reason people are raving about is the LGBT representation. But like the other elements of the story I have discussed, it is present but unsatisfying. There are only two reps in the book. One is a relationship that took place prior to the book. The other is a female/female relationship that happens during the story. Neither was written well. Because of the horrible lack of character development, none of the relationships in this book were remotely believable or poignant. When a relationship starts with one person fighting her feelings, liking her against her will, and eventually keeping their relationship a secret because she says she likes the forbidden secret more than everyone knowing… well, there is no way that is a healthy relationship. And the female/female sex scenes were awkward. I’ve never heard anyone, of any sexual orientation, wax poetic about someone’s knuckles!But the biggest annoyance and disappointment aboutThe Priory of the Orange Treeis that this was supposed to be a feminist story. IT ISN’T. Making most of your characters female doesn’t automatically make a story feminist. Making two of your characters lesbians doesn’t automatically make a story feminist. Switching gender rolls only to engage in the same sexist tropes certainly doesn’t make a story feminist.There is NOTHING empowering or inspiring about this book!This story has several allegedly strong female characters yet they all felt so hollow. That was mostly due to the substandard character development. They lack depth; they lack clear motivation; they lack any personality.So what does this alleged gender reversal consist of? Well, there is a queendom. But it’s ruled by women only because all of the heirs born happen to have been female, not because of truly being a female-ruled country. And the queen is little more than a figurehead being manipulated by others. Women are still cloistered, prized for their virginity, and seen as broodmares. So feminist, right?? There is a female dragonrider. I had hopes for her, but she is absent from large portions of the story, and her storyline is farfetched. Then there is Ead who is basically a magic-wielding warrior. But she has NO personality. It took a while, but I finally realized why she annoyed me so much: she reminds me too much of Nona fromRed Sister. And really, the Priory is basically the same thing fromRed Sister. They are both magic-wielding assassin nuns who are allegedly badass but are in fact boring as all-get-out. So now I know of two different authors who managed to make magic-wielding assassin nuns mind-numbingly dull! What a waste!This book was supposedly full of strong, badass women. But I couldn’t help but compare it to other books likeBloody Rosewhich had multiple strong female characters with distinct personalities, different strengths, different flaws, different motivations but all badass in their own unique way. And then I look back atThe Priory of the Orange Tree, and the first word that pops into my head is “FAIL!” To reiterate,making most of your characters female doesn’t make your story feminist.This book was a massive waste of my time. It took me three and an half months to slog through this and I absolutely had to force myself to keep going. The whole story is leaden and tedious.I deeply regret that I didn’t abandon it early on.More power to you if you slugged through this book and actually enjoyed it. But damn do I wish I hadn’t wasted my time on it.If you do still feel compelled to readThe Priory of the Orange Tree, I urge you to get the ebook. This isn’t worth getting carpal tunnel syndrome from lugging around the hardcover!RATING FACTORS:Ease of Reading: 1 StarWriting Style: 1 StarCharacters and Character Development: 1 StarPlot Structure and Development: 1 StarLevel of Captivation: 1 StarOriginality: 1 Star",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40275288-the-priory-of-the-orange-tree,The Priory of the Orange Tree.txt
The Tainted Cup,"This review is a copy of the transcript of my video review onThe Tainted Cup.ARC provided by the publisher—Del Rey Books—in exchange for an honest review.4.5/5 starsThe Tainted Cupis a compelling and rewarding murder mystery in a high fantasy setting redolent ofAttack on TitanandThe Last of Us.Robert Jackson Bennett is one of my favorite authors. Every time Bennet releases a new book in a new series, I feel it is mandatory for me to mention that fact. As a fan ofThe Divine Citiestrilogy andThe Founderstrilogy by him, I believe he is another SFF author deserving of so much more recognition. When I need engaging and inventive science fiction or fantasy books, I know it is safe to always rely on reading Bennett’s books. And he never fails to deliver. I am a reader who loves reading fantasy novels, Japanese manga, or Korean manhwa. I love storytelling, period. And there is satisfaction in reading stories that blend these sources into their creation, intentionally or not. Like howMy Hero Academiamanga by Kohei Horikoshi was born of the author's love for Western Superheroes and comics. And in the case ofThe Tainted Cup, the first book inThe Shadow of the Leviathanseries by Robert Jackson Bennett, it felt like a mix ofKnives Outin a setting inspired byAttack on TitanandThe Last of Us. So what is the premise ofThe Tainted Cup?“Oh, you’ve always got to smile a little, Din… Even during, you know, the abysmally fucking awful times.”The Tainted Cuprevolves around an eccentric detective named Ana Dolabra—an investigator whose reputation for brilliance is matched only by her eccentricities—and her long-suffering assistant, Dinios Kol—an engraver magically altered to possess a perfect memory. In Daretana’s most opulent mansion, a high Imperial officer lies dead—killed, to all appearances, when a tree spontaneously erupted from his body. Even in this canton at the borders of the Empire, where contagions abound and the blood of the Leviathans works strange magical changes, it’s a death at once terrifying and impossible. Din’s job is to observe, report, and act as Ana’s eyes and ears—quite literally because among Ana’s quirks are her insistence on wearing a blindfold at all times and her refusal to step outside the walls of her home. Din’s skill for observation and perfect memory with Ana’s impeccable deductions and mind, the two of them must cooperate to untangle a web of magic, deceit, and murder that endangers the safety of the Empire.“Oh, people love the Legion, with their swords and their walls and their bombards. But though they receive no worship, it’s the maintenance folk who keep the Empire going. Someone, after all, must do the undignified labor to keep the grand works of our era from tumbling down.”The Tainted Cuprightfully belongs in the high fantasy genre due to its setting and world-building, no doubt about that. But if I were asked to recommendThe Tainted Cupto readers, I would recommend it—more strongly—to readers who love reading murder mystery rather than fantasy novels due to the way Bennett structured the narrative. Of course, it would be even better if you are a fan of both genres, but fascination with murder mystery stories is more important here. I mentionedAttack on Titan(orShingeki no Kyojinin Japanese) by Hajime Isayama earlier. The story inAttack on Titanbegins with the Colossal Titan and the Armored Titan destroying the wall of Maria. Due to this unforeseen event, Eren, Mikasa, Armin, Levi, and many other characters in the series struggle to battle against the oppressive violence and horrors of the Titans.The Tainted Cupbegins with something akin to that premise. Immediately after the murder mystery begins, a breach to the massive wall of their civilization is inflicted by a titan—called Leviathan in the novel. However, it is worth noting thatThe Tainted Cupisnotan action-packed narrative centering on repelling the dangers the leviathan poses to the empire. The threats of the Leviathan loomed in the background, and I assume this will be explored further in the sequel. But at its core,The Tainted Cupis a murder mystery-centered narrative in a high fantasy setting, with a touch ofThe Last of Usowed to the Dappleglass contagion in the storyline.“It’s not all walls and death and plotting! Nor is it dreary dispensations and bureaucracy! We do these ugly, dull things for a reason— to make a space where folk can live, celebrate, and know joy and love.When we speak about detectives and their assistants in stories, it is difficult to avoid the names Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson. This setup and duo are popular in murder mystery stories for many valid reasons. After more readers readThe Tainted Cup, the duo of Din and Ana will remind readers of Holmes and Watson. Or, to make a comparison to a recently published fantasy series, the names Justice Konrad Vonvalt and Helena Sedanka fromEmpire of the Wolftrilogy by Richard Swan will be mentioned frequently. And none of these would be a mistake. Compared toThe Divine Citiestrilogy andThe Founderstrilogy, Bennett’s narrative inThe Tainted Cupis more plot-driven rather than character-driven. Understandably. InThe Tainted Cup, the story is narrated from the perspective of Din instead of Ana. Throughout the novel, we have not seen a lot of exploration into Din's character and background. With the exception of Din’s ability to retain memory and information as an Engraver, making him a living library of information, Ana is, in comparison, a more interesting character. Bennett himself has mentioned Ana is a mix of Nero Wolfe and Hannibal Lecter. But Din and Ana complement each other. Every investigation, clue, and report Din discovered for Ana, and every scene they were together, resulted in a relentlessly captivating reading experience.“I have never liked the company of too many people, Din. I have always preferred patterns and the consumption of information to socializing. I have preferred and will always prefer staying in my residence and will avoid stimulation at all costs. This is simply who I am.”If you have readCity of Stairsby Robert Jackson Bennett, then you will knowThe Tainted Cupis not Bennett’s first dive into writing murder mystery stories. And still, I was impressed by how everything clicked together in the last 13% of theThe Tainted Cup. The barrage of revelations was absolutely thrilling. It made me feel as if I was watchingSherlock HolmesorKnives Outin a fantasy setting. Even if you manage to predict the perpetrator, one of the best things about a murder mystery story is finding out how every puzzle fits the bigger picture nicely. It is in the details. A good revelation or plot twist is not only about shock value. It also means when you reread a story or think back upon it, you can see the puzzles and hints laid out for you, whether you realize their existence or not on your first traversal. As Bennet said, a murder mystery story is largely a process of logistics and ensuring the timelines work and the right evidence fits in the right place at the right time. And all of these have been accomplished brilliantly inThe Tainted Cup.“It’s the maintenance folk who keep the Empire going. Someone, after all, must do the undignified labor to keep the grand works of our era from tumbling down. I simply perform maintenance, in my own little way. And you have ably assisted me in that, of course.”I was on a streak of books ranging from disappointing to good quality.The Tainted Cupstopped the streak. The world-building is fascinating. The storyline is entertaining. And there are still tons of mysteries about the Leviathans and the two main characters to be given in the next books.The Tainted Cupis the beginning of an incredible murder mystery series in the high fantasy genre. The duo of Ana and Din will mark their spot in the detective's hall of remembrance. I can certainly envisageThe Shadow of the Leviathanseries spanning many volumes, and I will be grateful. Bennett mentioned he had fun writing the novel and is looking forward to reading more murder mystery novels in the series. It is reflected in the narrative. I always find it odd that despite having murder mystery as one of my favorite types of stories to consume, as proven in many fantasy and sci-fi books with this plot included, I almost never read non-SFF murder mystery novels. And somehow, even though it is marked as a fantasy novel, I believeThe Tainted Cuphas ignited my passion to read more non-SFF murder mystery books. It has been a pleasure and an honor to read this book early, and I already can't wait to read the next book in the series as soon as it's available. If you love the sound of reading a murder mystery novel with a compelling duo in an intriguing fantasy setting redolent ofAttack on Titan, readThe Tainted Cupby Robert Jackson Bennett.You can pre-order this book from:Amazon|Blackwells (Free International shipping)The quotes in this review were taken from an ARC and are subject to change upon publication.You can findthisand the rest of my reviews atNovel Notions| I also have aBooktube channelSpecial thanks to my Patrons onPatreonfor giving me extra support towards my passion for reading and reviewing!My Patrons: Alfred, Aliysa, Ambrosius, Andrew, Andrew W, Annabeth, Arliss, Barbara, Biskit, Brad, Cade, Chris, Christopher, Ciprian, Cullen, Dan, David, Dernerror, Donuts, Dylan, Edward, Elaine, Elias, Ellen, Francesca, Frank, Garrick, Gary, Gregory, Hamad, Helen, Jenn, Jesse, Jimmy Nutts, Joie, Jonathan, Jordan, Kristina, Lara, Lourdes, Luis, Maggy, Melinda, Michael, Michael, Mike, Miracle, Mordie, Nicholas, Norbert, Radiah, RCT, Redmischief, Samuel, Sarah, Sarah, Scott, Shawn, Tiffany, Tori, Tracy, Trish, TS, Wendy, Wick, Woodman, Xero, Yuri, Zoe.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/150247395-the-tainted-cup,The Tainted Cup.txt
Tress of the Emerald Sea,"4.5/5 starsTress of the Emerald Seawas simply whimsical and wonderful. Starting the year 2023 with the first secret novel from The Year of Sanderson is the correct action for me.“Even small actions have consequences. And while we can often choose our actions, we rarely get to choose our consequences.”The time is here. The first of the four awaited secret project novels,Tress of the Emerald Sea, by Brandon Sanderson is here. If you're active in the fantasy community, or even if you're not, it is no longer news that Sanderson has shocked the world with the immense success of his four secret novels Kickstarter campaign. I mean, number one most pledged Kickstarter campaign of all time; it doesn’t get more successful than that. And it shouldn’t also come as a shock that I, as a longtime fan of his Cosmere novels, end up enjoyingTress of the Emerald Sea. I wanted to start my year with a great book, and choosing this book as the first novel of 2023 (as I said) was the right pick. Sanderson plus a full-length Cosmere novel is a formula that never ceases to impress me. What I did not expect, however, was just how visually beautifulTress of the Emerald Seawould be. I am pleasantly surprised. I am glad the past Petrik decided to buy four premium hardcover editions of the secret novels, and I am eternally thankful to my co-blogger, TS, for covering the expense of the shipping fee. Without TS, I do not think I would cave into buying the premium hardcover editions, and I would regret it so much. I will go into more details on this later, but at $40 per secret novel (not counting the shipping fee) and for everything we get, this special edition can be considered, relatively, a bargain. This is on top of it being such a fun and cozy book to read.“Leaving didn’t feel exciting. It felt heavy. Every child looked forward to the day when they could choose a different path from the one their parents were on. Tress sincerely hoped she hadn’t decided on one that led straight off a cliff.”All her life on an island named The Rock in the emerald-green ocean, Tress lived a simple life with the simple pleasures of collecting cups received from sailors from faraway lands and listening to stories told by her friend, Charlie. But when Charlie’s father takes him on a voyage to find a bride and disaster strikes, Tress must leave her simple life to stow away on a ship and seek the Sorceress of the deadly Midnight Sea. Although I expected to love this book, I was initially worried after reading the first few chapters. Note the word ship in the official premise. Sailing and seafaring dominated the majority ofTress of the Emerald Sea. Personally, I tend to have mixed feelings about fantasy books with a heavy focus on seafaring unless they'reThe Liveship Tradersby Robin Hobb andThe Tide Childtrilogy by R.J. Barker. And there were indeed some sections here where I felt a bit of a lull because of this. However, my overall experience was fun. Most of the time, it was difficult for me to stay away from the book. Sanderson's prose and the relatively short length of the novel, plus its short chapters, made it easy for me to steal-read one or two chapters whenever I had some free time. This was a delightful book about human beings, contradictions, leadership, found family, stories, love, bravery, and empathy.“It might seem that the person who can feel for others is doomed in life. Isn’t one person’s pain enough? Why must a person like Tress feel for two, or more? Yet I’ve found that the people who are the happiest are the ones who learn best how to feel. It takes practice, you know. Effort. And those who (late in life) have been feeling for two, three, or a thousand different people… well, turns out they’ve had a leg up on everyone else all along. Empathy is an emotional loss leader. It pays for itself eventually.”Before readingTress of the Emerald Sea, I did not read any of the secret novel preview chapters. However, based on the known artists and the title or premise of the four novels,Tress of the Emeraldranked third out of four. I am interested in all four, but I am most excited about the third and fourth secret novels. Based on these, the first two secret novels felt like they would be the most tonally different from Sanderson's other Cosmere books. Having read all published Cosmere stories, including this one, I can convey thatTress of the Emerald Seahas proved it. Sanderson has mentioned thatThe Princess Brideis one of the main inspirations behind this book. Another good comparison for what kind of tone you're getting here isGood Omensby Terry Pratchett & Neil Gaiman. So it is time to admit something. I haven't read or watchedThe Princess Brideyet, but I have watchedGood Omens. And I think Sanderson nailed the comparison he's going for. The storytelling is whimsical and light-hearted in tone but also imbued with clever philosophical nuggets and serious themes occasionally. I loved the novel for it. I don't think I would've liked it this much if it was just all fun and joy all the way through. Sanderson's comedy, especially when the narrative involves young adult characters, doesn't land well with me often. But his hard-hitting and thought-provoking passages? That's another story. Sanderson may not have flowery prose, but the words he put on the pages of his novel frequently hit and became passages I think about daily. A few examples from this book are:“While a healthy measure of foolhardiness drove our ancestors toward discovery, fear kept them alive. If bravery is the wind that makes us soar like kites, fear is the string that keeps us from going too far. We need it, but the thing is, our heritage taught us to fear some of the wrong things.”And also these two long passages about memories.“Beyond that, memories have a way of changing on us. Souring or sweetening over time— like a brew we drink, then recreate later by taste, only getting the ingredients mostly right. You can’t taste a memory without tainting it with who you have become. That inspires me. We each make our own lore, our own legends, every day. Our memories are our ballads, and if we tweak them a little with every performance… well, that’s all in the name of good drama.”“Memory is often our only connection to who we used to be. Memories are fossils, the bones left by dead versions of ourselves. More potently, our minds are a hungry audience, craving only the peaks and valleys of experience. The bland erodes, leaving behind the distinctive bits to be remembered again and again. Painful or passionate, surreal or sublime, we cherish those little rocks of peak experience, polishing them with the ever-smoothing touch of recycled proxy living. In so doing— like pagans praying to a sculpted mud figure— we make of our memories the gods which judge our current lives. I love this. Memory may not be the heart of what makes us human, but it’s at least a vital organ. Nevertheless, we must take care not to let the bliss of the present fade when compared to supposedly better days. We’re happy, sure, but were we more happy then? If we let it, memory can make shadows of the now, as nothing can match the buttressed legends of our past… Do not let memory chase you. Take the advice of one who has dissected the beast, then rebuilt it with a more fearsome face— which I then used to charm a few extra coins out of an inebriated audience. Enjoy memories, yes, but don’t be a slave to who you wish you once had been. Those memories aren’t alive. You are.”Although possible, it wouldn't feel organic to have these kinds of passages appearing throughout the book if the novel is told through the first-person or third-person perspective of Tress. These were effective because the entire story inTress of the Emerald Seais narrated through Hoid's perspective. Hoid is an integral character in Sanderson's Cosmere universe. And we, Cosmere fans, are all waiting for Hoid's origin story. Sanderson mentioned he wanted to practice and be more fluent at writing Hoid's perspective before that backstory novel happened, and this is the book where it came to fruition. This won't, however, be how the story is told eventually in Hoid's backstory novel. It will definitely be less whimsical. But to give you an idea of the kind of voice Sanderson is giving Hoid in this book, if you've readThe Stormlight Archiveseries, this is more in tune with the unforgettable ""Wandersail"" and ""The Dog and the Dragon"" stories Hoid told in the series. A full-length version of that kind of in-world story. I absolutely loved ""Wandersail"" and ""The Dog and the Dragon,"" and obviously, I ended up lovingTress of the Emerald Seaas well.“Worldbringers like myself spend decades combing through folk tales, legends, myths, histories, and drunken bar songs looking for the most unique stories. We hunt for bravery, cleverness, heroism. And we find no shortage of such virtues. Legends are silly with them. But the person who is willing to reconsider their assumptions? The hero who can sit down and reevaluate their life? Well, now that is a gemstone that truly glitters, friend.”So yes, we get to learn more about Hoid and the Cosmere (more on this in the next paragraph) inside this book. But at the end of the day, even though this is told through Hoid's perspective,Tress of the Emerald Seais still a standalone story about Tress and her adventures. I mentionedThe Stormlight Archiveearlier, and I am no stranger to voicing how much I love the Bridge Four group in the series. The found family trope is one of the many things Sanderson executed extremely well inThe Stormlight Archiveand the firstMistborntrilogy. And he managed to craft another cherishable found family in this book. Tress, Huck, Fort, Salay, and all the characters are well-written and likable characters. The Deaf character representation was written with the help of a special sensitivity reader to do it justice, too. And hey, for the first time in the Cosmere, we finally get to see a real dragon. As Tress and the crew of the ship she's in face danger constantly, the bonds between them grow deeper and deeper. My investment in them, too. And upon reaching the last page, I can't help but hope we will get more stories or appearances from these characters eventually. Knowing how connected with each other the Cosmere is now, I'm confident we will.“She… didn’t need to do this all on her own. That shouldn’t have been such a revelation for her. But after spending ages walking around with everyone piling bricks in your arms, it can throw you off balance when someone removes a brick to carry for you.”Speaking of Cosmere connections, and because people will ask me this question, should you read other Cosmere books first?Tress of the Emerald Seais a standalone story in the world of Lumar. This marks the first time we get a book taking place in this world in the Cosmere. Like always, it is not necessary to read the other Cosmere books first to enjoy the main story here. But will you benefit from reading them? Yes, you will. I talk about this already in my review ofThe Lost Metal. But moving forward, Sanderson's future publications in the Cosmere universe, especially the ones taking place after book 5 ofThe Stormlight Archive, will most likely have heavy Cosmere crossovers. If you intend to read all of Sanderson's Cosmere books, it is a good idea to start catching up reading them if you want to reap all the connections. As for this book, reading the entirety ofThe Mistborn Sagaso far will be beneficial. Additionally, there were a few small nods to the magic or technology portrayed inWarbreaker,Elantris, andThe Stormlight Archive. I will leave it to you to decide whether you want to read them first or not. There is no spoiler for these three series. Also, although not the primary planet of the magic and there is no main novel for it yet, aethers and its explosive potential are explored here.“Now, most people would agree that humans are not telepathic. We can’t directly send our thoughts or emotions into the minds of others. Nevertheless, you can hear my story and imagine the things I describe—the same as I picture them in my own mind. What is that, if not a form of telepathy?”One more thing before I end this review. I will update this once I have the physical copy, but right now, even the ebook of the premium edition alone is exquisitely made. Unless the paper quality of the physical copy sucks, which is so doubtful, I can vouch that the $40 I spent on getting this book is well spent. Maybe too well spent. It is almost ridiculous. You won’t get a premium/special edition like this with only $40 anywhere else. If Subterranean Press or Grim Oak Press publishes a book like this, I guarantee it will cost at least $200 (not counting the shipping fee and customs fee yet). The stunning design and the more than ten interior artworks (four fully colored art and the rest in green-toned black and white) by Howard Lyon enhanced the quality of the aesthetic and the tale. They are magnificent. And I am brimming with excitement waiting for the physical copy to arrive at my place. And if the first secret novel already reaches this level of production value, I want to read and find out what the other three will look like. Rest assured, in this review, I leave out some surprises in the clever design and artwork inside this book for you to find out for yourself.“One of the great tragedies of life is knowing how many people in the world are made to soar, paint, sing, or steer— except they never get the chance to find out.”Whether aesthetically or narrative-wise,Tress of the Emerald Seaprovided a whimsical and wonderful reading experience. It is a refreshing addition to the Cosmere universe. And it is essentially (at least, it read like one) a Cosmere version of an adult fairy tale. With the success of the secret projects, some readers might think Sanderson favors quantity instead of quality in his books recently. It is up to you to think that way, but I can't voice the same sentiment. Personally speaking,Tress of the Emerald Seadoesn't show any drop in storytelling quality. Every book in the Cosmere, including this that he wrote in secret, works amazingly well for me. Similarly to the firstMistborn trilogy, even though this is undoubtedly a different kind of book, I thinkTress of the Emerald Seais a standalone story that can be enjoyed by both YA or adult fantasy readers. Making this even more appealing to a bigger audience. This is a superb first book of 2023 for me, and I hope this signals the positive trajectory of my reading year. I look forward to receiving the physical copy and reading the next secret novel.“The first is that heroes can be trained. Not by a government or a military, but by the people themselves. Heroes are the ones who have thought about what they’re going to do, and who have trained to do it. Heroism is often the seemingly spontaneous result of a lifetime of preparation… In the frenzied anarchy of destruction, loyalty to causes and kingdoms alike tends to fall to the chaos. But the bond between people, well, that’s stronger than steel. If you want to create heroes, don’t give them something to fight for. Give them someone to fight for.”You can pre-order this book from:Blackwells (Free International shipping)You can findthisand the rest of my reviews atNovel Notions| I also have aBooktube channelSpecial thanks to my Patrons onPatreonfor giving me extra support towards my passion for reading and reviewing!My Patrons: Alfred, Andrew, Andrew W, Annabeth, Barbara, Brad, Casey, Diana, Dylan, Edward, Elias, Ellen, Gary, Hamad, Helen, Jesse, Jimmy Nutts, Joie, Kristina, Luis, Lufi, Melinda, Meryl, Michael, Miracle, Neeraja, Nicholas, Radiah, Reno, Romeo, Samuel, Sarah, Sarah, Scott, Shawn, Wendy, Wick, Xero, Yuri, Zoe.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60531406-tress-of-the-emerald-sea,Tress of the Emerald Sea.txt
The Spear Cuts Through Water,"read this review on mymy blog!I genuinely don’t know where to start or how to review this book. The Spear Cuts Through Water is a book unmatched in storytelling and delivery and definitely my favourite book of the year. Despite it being told in a way I’m not accustomed to or done in other books, I’m in awe of how everything blended together to form a gripping story after a couple of pages.This book releases today and I’m hoping my review urges you to pick up this book and be immersed into this fresh world. Albeit it will not be everyone’s cup of tea but I do ask you to be patient with the story and let it guide you with the flow.“For you are the Moon who cursed us with this gift.”story within a storyI’m honestly a huge fan of this form of storytelling done right. It sets up the right stakes and there’s so much to explore, like peeling off layers of the story. Conveying multiple nested stories until it all clicks together is an art, one Simon Jimenez has mastered. There are several perspectives involved along with the use of 1st, 2nd and 3rd person to provide for all the twists and emotional impacts in the story. The summary doesn’t do this book justice, because as you’re introduced to the Inverted Theater, it’s as if you as a reader are witnessing the story unfold in that theater along with the unnamed narrator who is being told these stories about the Old World. And even though we hear from the minor characters, it doesn’t seem unnecessary, just something to help solidify the gravity of events.an epic fantasy at it’s coreThrough the unnamed narrator we witness the main storyline, about two warriors Jun, the grandson of the emperor and Keema, the disabled guard, who are roped into a quest to rescue a god from The Moon Throne, the tyrannical rulers of their land. With folklore woven effortlessly into the magic, action and setting of the story, The Spear Cuts Through Water has all elements of a fantasy world but the kind that’s surreal and unhinged in all those aspects. And a violent kind too, as the book definitely has gory themes but they perfectly fit into the characterization and world of the novel.Speaking of characters, I was immediately invested in Jun and Keema’s dynamic and the pure yearning they develop for each other. I loved being opened up to their complicated personalities, from reluctant travel companions to their love for each other.In fact most of the characters are very clearly imagined with necessary contributions to the plot, Simon Jimenez definitely has a knack for rooting characters into the reader’s brain within a short time.observes the manifestation of loveWe’re hit with the quote above at a point in the story where the narrator’s grandmother tells it to him and it accurately pierces the core of the story. We not only have a compelling and violent love story between the two protagonists but also see how love drives people’s actions, good and bad, and serves as a ray of hope. It’s brilliant how most of the characters are motivated by their want or scorn for love and Jimenez’s mind portrays the consequences for both in a fabulous way.brilliantly imaginedAs a huge lover of mythology and folklore in novels, I found the narrative of The Spear Cuts Through Water so engaging. It has an incredible and expressive prose, and with all the plot twists incoming reading this book was nothing short of a cinematic experience. Even though there was a lot to absorb, at times I was just left stunned by the writing and the emotion behind the sentences. Stunning imageries littered here and there left me in awe.I was so intrigued by the history of the world and the glimpses we get of it through Jun and Keema’s five day journey — and it’s not just a couple of perspectives but we get insights from the most insignificant characters in first person. I would normally be put off by it but I realised how well this structure worked for the novel as I wouldn’t have it any other way.I loved Simon Jimenez’s previous work, The Vanished Birds, and I’m happy to say that this too is a masterpiece and I hope he keeps serving. The Spear Cuts Through Water is an exhilarating and glorious tale, that if you’re hooked onto, will have you at the edge of your seat. It’s an ambitious and unconventional fantasy novel with heavy themes (check CWs) and a strange exploration of perspectives that might challenge readers, but I truly hope it finds its way to the ones who would appreciate the substance of the story!Also, if you want another glimpse into the author’s brilliant mind, readthis postabout the mapmaking of his book.Thank you Netgalley and Del Rey Books for the ARC!",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55868456-the-spear-cuts-through-water,The Spear Cuts Through Water.txt
As Long as the Lemon Trees Grow,"ˏˋ°•*⁀➷・❥・“𝓐𝓼 𝓵𝓸𝓷𝓰 𝓪𝓼 𝓽𝓱𝓮 𝓵𝓮𝓶𝓸𝓷 𝓽𝓻𝓮𝓮𝓼 𝓰𝓻𝓸𝔀, 𝓱𝓸𝓹𝓮 𝔀𝓲𝓵𝓵 𝓷𝓮𝓿𝓮𝓻 𝓭𝓲𝓮”・❥・ˏˋ°•*⁀➷⤿💌18/03/25➸infinite stars, spoiler-free review, shelved in 'invisible-heart-strings'💞Here I'm back with my polished review. This review is going be the longest one I've ever written here. Everyone should read this book at least once in their life despite whether they are a reader or not. You may ask why? No worries, that's why ✨I'M HERE✨ to convince you because that's my job 😌✋🏻 TWs mentioned at the end of the review, so make sure to read it ⚠️This book deserves every star of this universe 😭💫 I don't know where I should begin with, there are no words to describe or that would amount to how much this book means to me. I feel hollow inside yet so full of emotions at the same time like I was the last two years. This book is that book that makes you wish you could keep turning the pages even after you finished it long ago. This can painfully and beautifully break something inside you that you never thought existed before 🥺❤️‍🩹 I haven't found a book yet that can take the place of this one in my heart. You feel for the characters immensely, and you live through the characters experiencing all the emotions, hope, and love amidst the violence. I thought when rereading this for the third time again, I would never cry because I already knew what happens in each chapter, but oh boy, I was wrong. This is the only book that can make me cry always and touch my soul deeply every time 💓what to expect 💌:🍋 Pharmacist x Animator🍋 Halal Romance🍋 Found Family🍋 Dystopian🍋 HEA (still bittersweet)🍋 Two best friends who are more like sisters🍋 Soul mates (meant for each other)🍋 Studio Ghibli movies mentioned🍋 Resistance, hope, survival and love🍋 Dealing with grief🍋 Takes place in Syrian War~🍋“No one will remember our names. No one will know our story.”🍋~This might be a fictional imagination, an ink sprawled on pages, but what's written here is happening in real-time, in real life as many people's reality while I'm writing this review. When I picked up this book at the mark of two months to Gaza's genocide for the first time back in 2023, I knew very well there's gonna be all sorts of emotions, and that's what I was looking for as well- I needed to experience everything in a single book. I'm glad this book surpassed all my expectations- I giggled, cried, sobbed, became sad, and then happy on repeat while reading this book🥹🫶🏻.There is always this constant feeling inside us, i.e., fear of dying. It might sound cliché, but it's present inside every one of us. The people we see today might not be there tomorrow and vice versa. Without fear, emotions can't exist. And you might ask why am I suddenly speaking of the word 'fear'? Because this is one of the overarching themes of this book.~🍋“But no matter how many times I see it, no amount of warning can prepare me for the sight of a human struggling for breath. This is not normal, and it never will be.”🍋~Let's take a moment to imagine what life would be like to live in constant fear, in a country, where bombs are dropped from everywhere, and there is no safe place to go, not even your very own home is safe for you any longer. It's like living in a dystopian world right? Everywhere you see is blood, limbs scattered, people screaming under the rubble to be saved, children orphaned and shivering, people mourning their lost loved ones. You don't want to die. You just want to live a normal life like anyone. You fear you might not live to see the next sunrise/sunset. You fear for your loved ones' lives. You don't want to be separated from them. If you die, you want to die together, so nobody is left alone to face this cruelty anymore. This is what fear is, it gears our emotions, and it drives us to make sometimes irrational decisions. Death teaches us many things.~🍋“For every life I can’t save during my shift, one more drop of blood becomes a part of me.”🍋~All the characters in this book have touched me in so many ways. Each one of them gives you something to walk away with ❤️‍🩹 Salama Kassab taught me how to live with fear; Kenan Aljendi taught me how to fight for what I believe in through his faith, caring nature, kindness, hopefulness, and gentleness toward Salama, making her see the colors she once thought she would never see in Syria again; Layla was the most precious, she taught me how to see light even in the darkness of this world 🥺; Hamza taught me the importance of resilience and Dr. Ziad taught me to keep faith in God and move forward, to never give up.Kenan was Pazu to Salama, and Salama was his Sheeta🥹I swooned over their bantersTheir chemistry was out of the world 😩❤️‍🔥 We all deserve a Kenan in our lives too and I hope we all get one, Insha Allah 🥰🤍Me the whole time when Kenan appears, breathes, and speaks:~🍋“Insh’Allah, we will come back home. We will plant new lemon trees. We’ll rebuild our cities, and we will be free.”🍋~Love, hope, and dreams are what we hold onto when things get difficult.Zoulfa Katouhdid an amazing job showcasing every aspect of emotions in this book 👏🏻 There was so much love between Kenan and Salama. Despite going through turmoils- physically and mentally, they still held onto each other. The love they had for their country, their families, and in the hope they had for their future & their land Syria is soo very beautiful.~🍋“This is my land, and just like the lemon trees that have been growing here for centuries, spilled blood won’t stop us. I have my faith in God. He’ll protect me. I’ve been force-fed oppression, but I will no longer swallow its bitter taste. No matter what.”🍋~Throughout this whole book, it made me see a whole lot more- I can't put it into words. Whether Syrians or Palestinians or Sudanese, seeing their unshakable faith in the Almighty has shaken my faith. If they are God's chosen people for heaven-where do we stand then?A question I ask myself every day.If you've read till here, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your patience, love, and support. I hope you will give this book a chance and fall in love with Salama & Kenan 🥰💐💗Special thank you to my besties irl,Shaz & Fizzyfor reading this with me the first time around, giggling, flirting like Kenan with each other, and crying together in the messages.

The Wise Man's Fear,"An Opinionated look at:Patrick Rothfuss' The Wise Man's FearBy Eric AllenOne thing I can say for Patrick Rothfuss is that he has great ideas. Unfortunately, great ideas do not, by themselves, a great story make. I have heard rumors that the first book, The Name of the Wind, took eleven years of revisions and rewrites to finally get published. Whether that is true or not, his hard work paid off. Since its release, the internet hype over the future of the trilogy has been building to monumental proportions. Rothfuss has developed an almost rabid, cultlike following of fans yearning to know what happens next. The Name of the Wind gave us many mysteries and few answers.The first book was a fun read that, while flawed in terms of story and character, was quite entertaining and extraordinarily well written. It was like the ramblings of an old man, talking simply to be listened to. Like cake, it tastes good but has little nutritional value in it. Make no mistake, I really enjoyed the first book, but as a followup to a great book, The Wise Man's Fear was insultingly bad.We were left with many burning questions at the end of The Name of the Wind. Would Kvothe learn to control the Wind? How would he be thrown out of the University? Would he ever become an Arcanist? Would he find some way to make money? Would he ever avenge his parents? How did he come from the promising youth seeking clues to the supernatural beings that murdered his family to the broken down innkeeper telling the story? Would he ever make any sort of progress with Denna, or would my book simply explode while I read it because of the pent up sexual tension?Were any of these questions answered or even addressed in this book? Not a one. So let’s take a look at The Wise Man’s Fear. Or, as I like to call it: The Name of the Wind 2: Kvothe Gets Laid.We begin where The Name of the Wind left off, with a much older Kvothe, now an innkeeper, telling the story of his life to the king's Chronicler. It is a story in three parts, told in three days, much like the silence that haunts his inn. At first I didn’t get the whole silence in three parts thing, but then I realized the writer was trying to be clever and failing miserably at it.As Kvothe begins his story, the book switches from third person to first person. He begins his next term of schooling at the University. Some of his teachers love him, others hate him. He’s made friends and enemies. Unfortunately, we’ve already read this before. It seems like the last half of The Name of the Wind has basically been retold here in the first half of The Wise Man's Fear.Luckily, the ""plot"" finally intervenes, and Kvothe takes a year off from his schooling for adventure, and hopefully to fill his pockets with a little money to fight off his abject poverty. An acquaintance conveniently knows of a rich and powerful nobleman in a distant land that is looking for a clever young musician to help him win the heart of the lady he has his eye on. Fortunately, Kvothe happens to be a clever young musician. Convenient...To make an extremely long story short, he foils an assassination plot, gains the nobleman’s trust, and helps him woo his Lady. In a completely pointless tangent he’s sent on a mission to bring bandits to justice, loses himself on a tangent from the tangent when he meets a seductress who teaches him how to please women. Then the tangent from the tangent takes another tangent to another distant land where he learns to tangent from a group of tangentary tangents, but is tangented by yet another tangent after leaving when he tangents upon some young tangents in need of being tangentially tangented away from--wait, what as I talking about again? Oh right, I'm reviewing a book. One could say that the entire last half of the book is just one gigantic tangent that has absolutely nothing to do with anything, and ultimately leads nowhere.Falling out with his lordly employer, Kvothe returns to school with an arrangement that for his services his education and expenses at school would be taken care of. At which point he resumes his school life as if nothing has happened and the book ends rather abruptly, again with no climax, no conflict, and no resolution.The good? Rothfuss has an excellent sense of humor. Kvothe can be entertaining at times, when he's not acting like an insufferable smartass... which is most of the time. The world and the magic system are very well thought out, and the different cultures and races seem very distinct and real. The writing itself is excellent. So good in fact, that most people don't even realize what a god-awful mess every other aspect of the book is. Despite all the bitching I do about this book, it was worth reading at least once for the humor, or to see the train wreck for yourself.The bad? Firstly, it is very evident that Rothfuss has ABSOLUTELY no respect for women whatsoever. Almost every woman in this book is a figurative, if not literal, whore that exists for the sole purpose of pleasuring, comforting, or otherwise confounding Kvothe. News flash Pat, women are people too. The same as you and me, with thoughts, feelings, and desires all of their own, that do NOT typically revolve around some incomprehensible and fantastical yearning to please men. Just thought you'd like to know.Half of this book is copy and paste from the first book. The other half has little to no point and goes absolutely nowhere. There’s no conflict, there’s no suspense, there’s nothing like a normal story arch. There is no climax because the book doesn’t build up to anything. Like I said, Patrick Rothfuss has great ideas, but no storytelling skills to apply them to. The whole narrative is incoherent and nonsensical. You have to reward your readers with a climactic event or two for sticking with you through the whole book, Pat.Far too much time is spent on characters telling allegorical stories that really have little point or purpose except to take up space in a book that is already FAR too long for what actually happens in it. They take up huge swaths of the book and leave the characters with very little in the way of worth afterward. The lessons they learn could have been simply taught through other means or much, much shorter stories. The huge amount of tangents that the story takes makes it feel as though the writer made it up as he went along. It's really so incoherent, and so rambling that I believe this book should have been marketed more as a collection of short stories than a novel. The frequent interruptions back to the present day where Kvothe discusses aspects of his story are annoying and hugely distracting, breaking up whatever little suspense that the writer managed to cultivate. Not a single question raised in the first book was answered, or even addressed in this book, in fact this book picks up as though there were no questions left by the first book and does nothing to either build up the mystery of them, or move closer to answering them. It is as though the writer completely forgot all of them and moved on to something else.If you’ve read The Name of the Wind you have no need to read The Wise Man’s fear, because you’ve already read it. It’s basically the same book, and there isn’t a single thing necessary to the overall story that happens in it. When book 3 eventually comes out, you could probably pick it up after reading book 1 and not have missed a single thing. This book was completely unnecessary, and utterly pointless.I have never liked the first person perspective very much. It gives a very narrow view of the world as you can only see, experience and feel the world through the eyes of a single character. You have no other views to give perspective. I always find the contrasting views of different characters to give the world and story a lot more flavor than simply following the words of a single character. However, some of my favorite books are written in first person. It can be done well, and for the most part Rothfuss does good things with it, but when he moves to the parts of the book that happen in the present day he switches to third person and the contrast is jarring and almost as distracting as the actual interruptions themselves. Especially because he does not seem to be as talented in writing third person as he is at writing first person.Rothfuss goes out of his way to shoehorn the title of the book into the story in several places and it's really distracting. It was like he came up with a great sounding title, and then completely drew a blank on why the book should be called that, then dropped a couple references in after the fact. He also seems to think his readers are idiots and frequently talks down to them.The ugly? Lots and lots of sex. There are so many sex scenes in this book that I started to wonder if it shouldn’t have had a shirtless, ripped, long-haired dude on the cover and a title more like Warrior of Passion, or some such nonsense from the porn—er, I mean Romance—section of the bookstore. Everywhere Kvothe goes, women are throwing themselves at him. I wonder what his secret is… Must be the Axe body spray. In real life, no man has women constantly trying to jump his bones simply because he's the main character in the story of his own life. Especially not sixteen year olds who are often thought to be younger than that by appearance. That's called pedophilia, and most people tend to see that as very WRONG. News flash, women don't typically think or act like that. If I were a girl reading this book I think I'd find myself highly offended by this. It's almost as though he's the bearer of the One Wang. Yes, the fabled One Wang of Power. The One Wang to rule them all. The One Wang to find them. The One Wang to bring them all, and in the darkness... well, you know.Denna.I.HAAAAATE!!!!!FREAKING.DENNA!!!Oh my holy hell, I hate this character. Talk about doing EVERYTHING you possibly could in character creation wrong. I get that the writer obviously wanted to make a mysterious female character for the male lead to fall for, someone who equals his own mysteriousness. And that sort of thing CAN be done well, but here, it's definitely NOT. You can only drag it out so far before it becomes annoying, distracting, and downright torturous. Rothfuss has completely and utterly failed in making a compelling love interest. Why do I hate her so much? Because, frankly, she's just a badly crafted and written character. She is bland. So much so that Rothfuss should be both highly embarrassed and ashamed of her. She is boring. She is annoying. She tries to be clever, but isn't... AT ALL. She is not a realistic portrayal of a woman in the slightest bit. She serves no purpose to the plot whatsoever and is blatantly shoehorned in where she does not belong because someone decided that every work of fiction just HAS to have a love story in it. Her faux mysteriousness is badly written, contrived BS that does little but annoy the reader and make her even more painful to sit through. And, most importantly, she adds NOTHING of value to the story even in the barest possible meaning of the term! In short, she is completely unlikable in any way, shape or form. Besides being completely unlikeable, neither she nor Kvothe act like they give two damns about each other, and their relationship fails completely because it's been dragged out FAR too long. Even the most rabid Twi-tard would likely agree on that point.Sometime in the story SOMETHING has to happen between them. You can't just keep building up between two people that honestly have no reason to fall in love with each other and call it a love story. DO SOMETHING!!! And for the record I do not count an argument that has absolutely nothing to do with their relationship in any way to be ""something"" happening in said relationship. Rothfuss keeps playing up her mysteriousness to such a degree that I finally just started flipping through and skimming the last few chapters with her in them because she pisses me off too much. I get it, she’s terribly mysterious, GET TO THE DAMN POINT ALREADY!!! She turns an otherwise entertaining character into a whining, crying, spineless, emo, stalker. Her character is so distracting and utterly painful to be subjected to that she completely ruins the book all on her own. If every other gripe I had about the book mysteriously disappeared, the presence of Denna alone would have ruined it. Worst of all, this painful mess of a love story, has yet to serve any purpose to the overall plot. Oh, it may come into play in the third and final book, but suffering through this horrible, boring, emotionless, and frankly unbelievable abomination for two books leading up to it is asking too much. There haven't even been any hints whatsoever that it may, in fact, be important later on to what passes for a plot in Patrick Rothfuss' universe. It’s a contrived, annoying, distracting, and frankly painful waste of time.Remove Denna from the series entirely and it is a much better series. I do not know who came up with the rule that in every work of fiction there must needs be a love story, but guess what. Sometimes, you really don't need one. It becomes superfluous and takes away from the story instead of adding to it. This series certainly would benefit a GREAT DEAL without one. Why? Because Rothfuss doesn't know the first thing about love, which is painfully obvious if you've read even one scene between Kvothe and Denna. He doesn't seem to understand what love is, or how it works. He seems to subscribe to the George Lucas version of love. Two talented and good looking people are together... TADAAAAAAH, IT'S LOVE!!! now shut up and enjoy your ridiculously over the top computer animated explosion fest of a climax. If you can't craft a believable and compelling love story. STOP. Take two steps back. And completely remove it from your book, because the story is better off without it than it is when it completely fails.A love story has to develop and always be moving. Whether it be forward or backward, it must always be going SOMEWHERE. The characters have to get to know each other and fall in love through mutual experiences and differences, not randomly meet here and there and have a boring conversation with a convenience that stretches credulity and coincidence alike. The supposed relationship between Kvothe and Denna goes exactly NOWHERE, and it leaves you wondering why the author keeps trying to tell us that there is even a so-called love story between these two characters at all in the first place. There has to be some sort of progress made. You can’t throw two good looking people together that have no reason to fall in love with each other and call it a love story. There is nothing about this love story that is a.) even a love story and b.) the slightest bit interesting.And yet Kvothe continuously pines after this girl as though he has any sort of meaningful relationship with her when there is no reason whatsoever for him to even care that she exists, other than that she's a girl and he's a boy. There may be some small, one-sided physical attraction on his part, but physical attraction does not equal love. The attraction is NOT mutual, however, and that is plainly obvious in the way that Denna acts and speaks to Kvothe. The lengths to which the author goes to assure us that there is a love story here are almost as creepy as the lengths to which Kvothe goes to stalk her. Especially because she has expressed no romantic interest in him at all and frequently attaches herself to other men IN HIS PRESENCE, INCLUDING his arch-nemesis Ambrose. AND THEN, Kvothe himself basically bones every girl he meets in the entire book OTHER THAN HER!!! What is this? This isn't a love story. It's like watching a rock try to get it on with a piece of wood. They constantly boink other people throughout the book, and seem to have no romantic feelings toward one another at all. Do you even understand what love is Pat? From this book I can definitely say that you do not. I haven't seen such a failure to write a compelling love story since Attack of the Clones. And I'm not just biased against love stories because I'm a guy. I will admit that I do enjoy the occasional, well done love story, so long as it actually serves a purpose to the plot, or makes me feel that these characters truly do love each other and deserve to be together--two things that are lacking here, so much so, in fact that it completely and utterly ruins the entire series from the first page Denna walked in on. The moment she showed up was the moment this series was irrevocably ruined. I can’t wait for her foreshadowed death because I will cheer with joy the day I read her last words. Until then, I award Patrick Rothfuss the George Lucas Totally Understands Love Stories Award.So, after all is said and done, is The Wise Man’s Fear really as bad as I make it out to be? YES!!! IT IS!!! But at the same time, no. It really isn’t that horrible. If you can ignore that this entire book is completely pointless and full of a non-love story that is really starting to grate, it can be quite entertaining. The sense of humor, and Kvothe as a character, are enough to keep you interested through the good and the bad alike. Denna is annoying and pointless, but you can skip any chapter about her and miss little to nothing because she's not important to the plot and serves no purpose at all except to make Kvothe so lovesick that he screws 25+ other girls during the course of the book. *shrug* Yeah, I don't get it either. If sex scenes offend you, you’ll be doing quite a bit of skipping. As I said before, this book was completely unnecessary, and did nothing at all to ultimately advance the plot, or the characters. If you come at it as a work of comedy rather than part of a grand epic fantasy, then you'll likely be entertained by the humor. On the other hand, you could pick up book 3 when it comes out and not be lost at all, because this book was about nothing. The characters did not learn, grow or progress at all, and it ends as it begins, with Kvothe in school, dealing with the same problems he was dealing with in the beginning. He hasn't taken anything away from his misadventures. He hasn't learned any lessons. He's the same character he was at the beginning. There’s a great story in here somewhere, the author keeps hinting at great events to come, but he never takes any steps closer to them. It’s the best book about absolutely nothing that you’ll ever read.At the risk of inviting nerd rage the likes of which GOD has never seen, I give The Wise Man’s Fear 1 star. It loses points in complete lack of plot, endless tangents, repeated use of pointless allegory, and inflicting Denna's completely horrible side story on us. The only thing that kept me reading this book was the sense of humor. Patrick Rothfuss seemed so promising after his debut novel, but I doubt his will be a lasting name unless his next book makes some major improvements upon the pile of steaming crap he served us with The Wise Man's Fear. He has obvious talent, but lacks any skill to apply it to. I have been accused of giving this book a poor rating simply because everyone else loved it. This is untrue. You can take my words at face value. I mean what I say. I say this book is terrible because I truly feel that it IS terrible. Not every book is for everyone, and this one is not for me. Just because a lot of people enjoyed it does not mean that I did. I've read a rare few books I disliked more than this one. Agree or not, that is my HONEST opinion. You don't have to agree with me, but I don't have to like this book. I have never read a book so vacuous, vapid, pretentious, and up its own ass as The Wise Man's Fear.Check out my other reviews.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1215032.The_Wise_Man_s_Fear,The Wise Man's Fear.txt
Vicious,"”Someone could call themselves a hero and still walk around killing dozens. Someone else could be labelled a villain for trying to stop them. Plenty of humans were monstrous, and plenty of monsters knew how to play at being human.”(Just in case you actually want to read my full review. *lol* You can read ithere!)This is easily one of the best books I’ve read in 2019 and that’s quite something, because I already read so many other awesome books this year. To give“Vicious”5 stars was a no-brainer though and I’m very glad that my reading buddy saw it the same way. As it seems we were both hooked right from the beginning and the longer we read, the more we immersed ourselves in the story.I thought long and hard about the many reasons I liked this so much and I think it’s mostly due to the way it was written. V.E. Schwab made her story some sort of puzzle and the longer you read, the more is revealed and every piece eventually falls into place. It wasn’t until I started to write down a few of the quotes that I finally realized why I could relate to her writing style so much. XD It felt like reading one of my forum role-play games. *lol*Let me explain a little bit more: There are people that will write short posts that cover the basics and then there are people that will write an entire character with its background story and play it out in 900 – 1.000 word posts that stretch over the course of years, sometimes even decades. Yes, you already guessed right, I’m the latter one. ;-P And so it’s no surprise I was intrigued by V.E. Schwab’s handiwork.There’s a certain depth to her characters you never actually see on the pages, but it’s all there, in their actions, the way they behave. In the way they talk and interact with each other. There’s an entire background story and we get it piece by piece, little by little, but never all of it and to say I was captivated by this would be the understatement of the century. XD I lived and breathed for it, I tasted blood and I crave for more!!! <3Next time I’m at the library I’m going to pre-order “Vengeful” and if it’s only half as good as “Vicious” I shall be more than just fine! ;-) This said, I’ll go right into my character’s section because damn, there’s a lot to discuss! XDThe characters:Welcome to my spoilery spoiler section! Take a seat, make yourself comfortable and enjoy the show! Be warned though, I’m at least as fierce as Victor when it comes to book characters and just like him I won’t sugar-coat things and spoil you not only thoroughly but also relentlessly! ;-PEli Cardale (Ever):”Well, when you wonder something,” said Eli, “doesn’t that mean part of you wants to believe in it? I think we want to prove things, in life, more than we want to disprove them. We want to believe.”I didn’t like Eli which actually made him the perfect villain. *lol* The funny thing is that I’m pretty certain he’s more human and compassionate than Victor, yet this also seems to be the main reason why he’s worse than him. Am I already confusing you? XD Okay, let me put it this way, whilst Victor’s analytical mind controls his actions the same can’t be said about Eli. When the shit hits the fan Eli is following his gut feeling and because he believes he’s doing the right thing he goes through with it and never second guesses his decisions. I’d even go as far as to say that Eli is some sort of religious fanatic and that he sanctions his actions by his belief. And what is more human and more powerful than people’s beliefs? There are centuries of history that prove how many bad things have been done in the name of religion and Eli’s character is some kind of embodiment of it. He lives by his principles and this doesn’t only make him a very dangerous man, it also makes him very human. Eli is on a mission and everyone who interferes with it will be the next victim on his Ever-growing list. ;-) (see what I did there?! *lol*)”On the surface, Eli seemed perfectly normal, but now and then Victor would catch a crack, a sideways glance, a moment when his roommate’s face and his words, his look and his meaning, would not line up. Those fleeting slices fascinated Victor. It was like watching two people, one hiding in the other’s skin. And their skin was always too dry, on the verge of cracking and showing the color of the thing beneath.””A hero. Wasn’t he? Heroes saved the world from villains, from evil. Heroes sacrificed themselves to do it. Was he not bloodying his hands and his soul to set the world right? Did he not sacrifice himself every time he stripped away an EO’s stolen life?””I died begging for the strength to survive, and it was granted. But it’s a trade, Professor, with God or the devil, and I’ve paid for my gift with the lives of my friends. Every EO has sold a part of themselves they can never have back. Don’t you see?” He knelt beside Lyne, whose fingers twitched. “I can’t let anyone else sin so heinously against nature.”Victor Vale:”She watched him as he worked, his touch impossibly light, as if he was afraid of breaking her. Everything about him was light – his skin, his hair, his eyes, his hands as they danced through the air above her skin, touching her only when absolutely necessary.”I absolutely ADORED AND LOVED Victor Vale!!! <333 What an intriguing and morally grey character! I just loved the way he thought! His analytical and cunning mind was everything I ever craved for and even more and I just couldn’t get enough of his character. I loved that he was so unapologetic and that he knew exactly who he was. Yes, he tried to blend in with the others, but he never claimed to be something that he wasn’t. If you ask me I’d say Victor is a psychopath, at least if you consider all the typical signs of it. Then again Eli certainly was one too. He might have been more empathic than Victor but whilst Vic knew what was expected of him, Eli ultimately seemed more inclined to ignore human morals than to follow them. I loved how Victor questioned his actions, how he paused to think if what he did was right or wrong, how he weighted both sides against each other and then eventually decided to do what his logic told him. He was vicious and brutal, but he could also be gentle and caring and boy, did I live for that moral ambiguity. *lol*”The paper called Eli a hero.The word made Victor laugh. Not just because it was absurd, but because it posed a question. If Eli really was a hero, and Victor meant to stop him, did that make him a villain?He took a sip of his drink, tipped his head back against the couch, and decided he could live with that.””Victor watched his friend, mesmerized by the transformation. He himself could mimic most emotions and pass them off as his, but mimicking only went so far, and he knew he could never match this … fervor.””You can’t kill me, Victor,” said Eli. “You know that.”Victor’s smile widened as he buried his knife between Eli’s ribs.“I know,” he said loudly. He had to speak up over the screams. “But you’ll have to indulge me. I’ve waited so long to try.”Sydney:”That’s what Sydney was giving these people. A second chance.Her fingers hovered over the dead man’s chest for a moment as she wondered if he deserved a second chance, then chided herself. Who was she to judge or decide or grant or deny? Simply because she could, did that mean she should?”Poor little Sydney! I felt so sorry for her! She didn’t choose to have a power like that but she was hunted for it nevertheless. I found it interesting that she was so young but already asked herself the right questions. In some way that made her a good counterweight to Victor and Eli. I mean there is this powerful girl and she has no idea what she can do with her abilities or what she’s capable of. She was a very strong character though and I loved her for her defiance. <3 It takes guts to live with a man like Victor and she might have questioned his actions but she was never afraid of him. XDSerena:”She looked at Victor’s profile one last time, and tried to picture the man who had once been Eli’s friend, who had brought him back, made him what he was, saved her sister … and for a moment, as she finished dialing Eli’s number, she almost wished he stood a fighting chance.”Now Serena was a character that caused me to think long and hard as well. On the one hand I liked her for standing up to Eli by charming him to do her will, and on the other hand I disliked her for helping him to find and eliminate his targets. If she was so good at compelling people why didn’t she try to stop Eli for good? She played him, yet at the same time she did what he wanted her to do. Why? Did she really think that this was the only way to save her own skin? Did she truly believe that EO’s are dangerous and that they deserve to die? Her character posed so many questions and to my chagrin none of them were answered. >_< She definitely had one of the best scenes in this book though. The moment Victor killed her and quoted Ulysses was priceless!! <3The relationships & ships:Victor & Eli:”You asked me if I ever wanted to believe in something. I do. I want to believe in this. I want to believe that there’s more.” Victor sloshed a touch of whiskey over the edge of his glass. “That we could be more. Hell, we could be heroes.”“We could be dead,” said Eli.“That’s a risk everyone takes by living.”Ohh those two gave me a lot to wonder about. I’m convinced Victor was in love with Eli and that this was the reason why he wanted his revenge so badly. I mean he was betrayed by the person he loved and to make it even worse Eli didn’t even bother to hear him out. He didn’t give him the benefit of the doubt, no, he ratted him out to the police the moment he knew his girlfriend had died. It was like Eli always expected Victor to go off the rails and only waited for an opportunity to turn on him. Funnily enough it turned out that Eli was the one that actually went off the rails in the end. After all Eli’s girlfriend was the only person Victor killed and this was by accident and not intentional. The same certainly couldn’t be said for Eli though. He killed his victims on purpose and went after them with a vengeance. Sure, once Victor got out of prison his death tally went up as well, he never killed without a purpose or reason though. Which is the main difference between those two. Victor always considered the pros and cons while Eli acted as judge and executioner and didn’t even give his victims a chance to defend themselves, let alone to speak. Now that Eli is in prison I can’t help but wonder what’s going to happen next. I guess I’ll find out once I get my hands on a copy of “Vengeful”. ;-P”He and Eli were bonded, by blood and death and science. They were alike, more so now than ever. And he had missed Eli. He wanted to see him. And he wanted to see him suffer. He wanted to see the look in Eli’s eyes when he lit them up with pain. He wanted his attention. Eli was like a thorn beneath Victor���s skin, and it hurt. He could turn off every nerve in his body, but Victor couldn’t do a damned thing about the twinge he felt when he thought of Cardale.””I don’t want to see Serena,” said Sydney.“I know,” said Victor. “But I want to see Eli.”“Why?” she asked. “You can’t kill him.”“That may be.” His fingers curled around the shovel. “But half the fun is trying.”Sydney & Victor:”I’m cold,” she said.“I’m Victor,” he said, and she offered him a small, exhausted flicker of a smile.Their relationship was so precious! <3 Victor became some sort of father figure for Sydney and even though she knew that he had a bad moral compass she still trusted him and felt safe with Victor. I loved that he was always so honest with her and didn’t even try to sugar-coat things. He gave her room to come to her own conclusions and he provided a safe environment to live in. In some way that made him an amazing father even though he certainly wasn’t the best choice to raise a kid like her. *lol* Still, those two worked because Sydney acted as some sort of conscience for him and that ultimately made him a better person. XD I wonder if their relationship is going to change after she brought him back from the dead and if yes in which direction it’s going to head. Oh and I just realized that Vic joined Eli in not being able to age. ;-)”Sydney, look at me.” He rested his hands on the car roof and leaned in. “No one is going to hurt you. Do you know why?” She shook her head, and Victor smiled. “Because I’ll hurt them first.””Serena hadn’t told Sydney to go home. She hadn’t told her to run away. She’d told her to go somewhere safe. And over the course of the last week, safe had ceased to be a place for Sydney, and had become a person.Specifically, safe had become Victor.”Serena & Eli:”She pulled away enough to hold him with her cold blue eyes. He could see the devil in them, silver-tongued and cunning, and Eli thought, not for the first time, that he should have killed her when he had the chance.”Serena and Eli had one of the most abusive relationships I ever witnessed. They both abused each other in equal measure and this was weirdly fascinating. Their dynamic was crazy and they both didn’t hesitate to use their powers in order to get what they wanted. I think in some way they even loved each other, yet they both couldn’t change the way they were. Eli craved to kill Serena but was fascinated by her and Serena wanted to stay alive but couldn’t seem to be able to turn away from Eli. What a stalemate. XD Wicked faerie tongues (like mine) would say Victor relieved them from the trouble of killing each other and they might be right. *lol*Conclusion:I loved this and I could kick myself for not reading it sooner!“Vicious”was the amazing start of a compelling story and I can’t wait to read its sequel“Vengeful”. Morally grey characters, a captivating storyline and the omnipresent question of what is right and what is wrong made this a truly thrilling journey! I don’t know about you, but I want more! ;-)Last but not least I want to thankMr. Babygreysfor another great buddy read!

A River Enchanted,"“From your life came mine. I would not exist if you had been born in the east. I am but a verse inspired by your chorus, and I will follow you until the end, when the isle takes my bones and my name is nothing more than a remembrance on a headstone, next to yours.”🥹🤌🏻You know the feeling when u read something so beautiful that you can’t stop thinking about it. Well yes this book made me feel like this, i went out with my friends today and I couldn’t stop thinking about it. the only thing that was in my mind was that i need to go home to start book 2. my brain refused to think about anything other than this painful ending!! 💔🥲Rebecca Ross 🧎🏻‍♀️🧎🏻‍♀️I was hooked, obsessed, addicted to this book. It was so beautifully, wonderfully, magically written. The book is everything sweet and magical and mysterious. Rebecca Ross writing style has the ability to make me see through the papers. to make me feel like I'm one of the main characters that i was present with them. It’s one of these books that will make you escape and forget reality. I loved it so much 🫶🏻 i want this book to turn into a movie and timothee chalamet to be jack please 😋✋🏻its more fantasy than it is romance so yeah keep that in mind when u read it 🫶🏻“He is afraid of losing you, first in heart, then in body.

Throne of the Fallen,"""Camilla?” She paused on the threshold, glancing back.“If you run, I will chase you.”Spice:🌶️🌶️🌶️I am willing to fight anyone who dares to badmouth this series. I probably won't do much damage. I have no physical strength whatsoever, but I will fight nonetheless. It might have taken me a little while longer to finish it because life sucks for grown-ups and I didn't sign up for this, but I was still completely hooked on this book. I couldn't do much else during my free time. The shocking moments alone were enough to leave me speechless. Not to mention the level of intelligence behind this dangerous game Envy and Camilla are playing, the stakes for the parties involved, especially the demon prince, and the complications that constantly arise. I particularly enjoyed how much more of this world is explored. Maniscalco took the opportunity to explore different fantasy species with this book and it is always the best way to provide exposition. I can't wait to see what other creatures Maniscalco focuses on in her next books.Moreover, Camilla and Envy are fantastic. They are such complex characters with their own traumatic backstories and dark secrets. It might be a cliché to most, but I love how vulnerable they secretly are while showing a tough exterior, especially Envy. I mean, he is a demon prince but he likes painting, and his chest tightened when Emilia made him canolli, but he also tricks and murders people without an ounce of guilt. How cute is that? As for Camilla, she is a cinnamon who hates her solitude, but could also tease you endlessly and fuck your brains out. In other words, they are perfect.In addition, their relationship is positively insane. Not only is their chemistry off the charts, but their dynamic is incredibly intense as well. They have a hard time trusting each other fully, even though they can't help but be vulnerable together at times. Regardless, the sexual tension between them is so thick it couldn't even be cut with a knife, and the way they tease each other so mercilessly is as frustrating as it is entertaining. Also, they are so obviously enamored with each other, even though they keep denying it, that every single person who encounters them can tell immediately. Envy's brothers in particular have the most fun watching them.Lastly, reading this book reminded me just how charming and wonderful the Princes of Hell are. They are as funny as they are intense, they love messing with each other, and even though they fight and argue a lot, they clearly care for one another. Basically, they're siblings, but whose main form of fighting is stabbing. I love them all, but my favorite one has to be Sloth. He reads! He has reading glasses that he keeps around his neck with a chain, he's thick as fuck, and has little interest in debauchery (at least public one, apparently), and his House mostly consists of books. I have never hated my reality more. It is so unfair thatmendemons like him don't exist. I would give anything to have Kerri Maniscalco write me as his love interest. Wishful thinking, right? However, from the way this book wraps up, it seems like Pride's story is the next to come. Not that I mind in the slightest. On the contrary, I can't wait to finally read his and Lucia's story. I love it when the love interests already have a past. Additionally, even though Wrath and Emilia are secondary characters now, their presence in the book, minimal as it is, is a gift. Especially since any mention of them mostly consists of their kinky sexual escapades. I couldn't ask for anything more.Throne of the Fallen B&N Bonus Content:There was no way in hell I wouldn't track down this bonus content by any means necessary. Shipping restrictions will not stand in the way of me reading Wrath and Emilia's kinky sexcapades from Wrath's point of view. I will find a way. Thankfully, there's always a good person who takes pictures of their copy's bonus scenes and posts them online for us unfortunate souls. They are the real heroes. I am also excited to try Envy's cocktail recipe but it is admittedly overshadowed by Wrath and Emilia.Envy mentioned in the book that the King and Queen of Hell were getting into some really freaky stuff together, but it wasn't enough to prepare me for what I read. To be fair, it is very mild compared to other spicy content in modern literature. Nonetheless, those two have some interesting uses for an alcove that has been converted into a red room, chains for obvious reasons, and...a certain House Dagger. Yes, it is used exactly the way you think it is and I will never see a House Dagger the same way again. On the contrary, I expect it to be used the same way again soon. Where was this kind of behaviour in theKingdom of the Wickedseries? Why did we not get a glimpse of it until now? The other problem here is that the chapter is too damn short. You can't just write a scene with two ridiculously hot characters doing some ridiculously hot stuff and end it in five pages. It's not enough! Kerri Maniscalco is truly a mean tease. It's like she wants us to constantly be sexually frustrated.Oh, yes! Envy's cocktail looks fun too! 😇",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/73071451-throne-of-the-fallen,Throne of the Fallen.txt
A Dawn of Onyx,"I was provided a copy of the book by the author in exchange for an honest review.

I got sucked in from the very first chapter and just couldn’t stop! I had a bad syndrome of “just one more chapter with this one”!Now would be a great time for that optimism I’d been told I had in spades.But I feared there was no positive spin for flying via massive, horned dragon as a prisoner into enemy territory. I looked down at the land below me, cloaked in darkness, and watched the only life I’d ever known disappear from sight.Arwen spent her whole life in her small village, caring for her sick mother, and secretly using her healing power to help her people. The past year has been rough for her mother, her younger sister, and her because her brother was forced to enroll in the army to fight against their enemy from the kingdom of Onyx. When Arwen’s brother unexpectedly comes back with stolen Onyx gold, they only have a few minutes to pack up and leave for another kingdom where there is no war, before Onyx’s soldiers catch up to them. Everything does not go according to plan, and Arwen finds herself a prisoner of the Onyx army. She ends up first in prison and then forced to work as a healer for Onyx, and that is how she meets the famous and feared king Kane Ravenwood.Arwen is such a lovable and relatable main character! She is strong, resilient, and driven, but also flawed and not amazingly good at everything she does as soon as she tries it. She is kind and intelligent, while also being snarky and fierce. Overall, she felt very human and real. She is thrown into a new country with her enemies surrounding her, and she is afraid, but that’s where her strength shows and her bravery shines. There was a time or two when she made choices or had reactions that annoyed me a little, mostly when she acted like a jealous teenager wanting to mark her territory with Kane, even though they were not involved romantically or physically together, but as I said, she is not perfect and I like that about her. Besides those few rare instances, she was amazing and I can’t wait to see more of her and see how she continues to grow and gain confidence in the next book.“You met King Kane Ravenwood? And spoke to him? What was he like?”“Horrible,” I snapped. “And miserably handsome. An awful combination.”“You’re hurt. Why didn’t you say something?”“It’s nothing, just a bruise.”Anger simmered in his eyes. “Who did this to you?”I love Kane, he is a great character and love interest. He is protective, but not over the top and too controlling, and he is very devoted to Arwen and her happiness. He supports her and her ambitions, and he encourages her to become better, stronger, and be able to defend herself instead of just deciding that he will be in charge of protecting her. His support and the way he treats Arwen as a valued equal were very attractive. Much more than just being gorgeous and having a 6 pack and a chiseled jaw, as is sadly often the case in YA or NA romances. I also love that Kane has a manipulative side and that he has to lie and keep putting his kingdom first, that even if he is attracted to Arwen, he can’t allow himself to get involved with her, and he has to deceive her at times. It created some tension, especially near the end of the book, and the sequel promises to have some drama and groveling so I am very excited to read it.I had never been so outspoken with anyone in my life. I hated him, I didn’t respect him, I didn’t trust him, and I could not for the life of me keep my thoughts off him and his smug, cruel words.“I love to listen to you explain medicinal practices,” he purred.“And I’d love to listen to you fall off a cliff.”“What do you want? I have a patient to tend to.” I hoped my breathy voice might be accredited to shock.“You’ve been avoiding me.”I swore steam was curling out of my ears “Could you be any more self-obsessed? This man is dying.”I loved the romance in this book. It’s a slow burn full of sexual tension and sassy banter. I do love the “captive in the enemy hold” trope because it often goes hand in hand with a hate-to-love romance. Sadly it too often ends up with insta-love, but not in this book! Arwen truly despises the King, not only because of the rumors she heard about him but also because of his behavior toward her, and his lies. Honestly, their relationship reminded me a little bit of Rhysand and Feyre in ACOTAR and the first part of ACOMAF. Kane doesn’t hate Arwen, he is intrigued and interested in her, but she is afraid of him and hates him because of his bad reputation, and because he goads her and pushes her buttons every time they interact. What would have made it even better would have been a dual point of view. I was dying to know what was going on in Kane’s head, but at the same time, us not knowing allowed the author to give Kane a hidden agenda that wasn’t revealed until the end, and I liked that too.Mari is also a great secondary character who had a use besides supporting the main character in her quest. She is fiery and bubbly, and I really loved her too. Overall, the characters were all well developed and fleshed out, and the author did a great job with the dynamics and the relationships developing in this book, but she also left room for more relationship-building and more character development in the next book. Griffin is also a secondary character that intrigued me, and I am curious to see more of him and his grumpy behavior with Arwen (I am also shipping him and Mari).Halden’s storyline felt weaker now that I am reading this for the second time and could focus more on the details, or maybe it’s more that there is a lack of backstory there. He didn’t want to fight at first and was forced to enroll in the army 2 years ago, and now he is part of one of the King’s secret elite groups. How did that happen? Why was he chosen when he didn’t care about the war? I would have needed more details to truly believe his story and be more invested in his plotline and how it affected Arwen. I hope we will get those details in the next book if he is still a part of the plot.This book was mostly about Arwen trying to survive the predicament she found herself in and trying to thrive in her new environment, but the next book will clearly be more about her taking her destiny into her own hands, and even being in charge of what happens to a certain extent, instead of letting Kane decide of her fate because he is the King. I am very curious to see how her relationship with Kane will progress. There was a lot of flirting and sexual tension between them in this book, but not a lot of smut (I am not complaining), so it built up even more sexual tension and now I am eager for them to do something about it too, but with the way things were left between the two of them at the end of this book, I am not sure love will be in the air at the beginning of the second book (and the angst-lover in me is overjoyed by the promise of angsty groveling).Follow me on Instagram🙂",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/195775182-a-dawn-of-onyx,A Dawn of Onyx.txt
What Lies Beyond the Veil,"2 ⭐️ Interesting fantasy world but predictable storyline, incredibly sexy moments but sometimes cringyTrigger Warning (18+):abuse, grooming, molestation (mentioned), violence, death of character (side)Summary:""You're going to break me""""No, Little One. I'm going to love you. Until you forget what it is to hurt and then long after that. Until the scars you wear like armor have faded from memory, and only we remain.""For nearly 400 years, the Veil has protected humans from the Fae of Alfheimr. Until one day, it shatters, unleashing fae upon the world again.Estrella spent her entire life tending to Lord Byron's gardens in Mistfell during the day and receiving private lessons from him and his tutors at night. But once the barrier between the two realms is broken, Estrella's life is forever changed. Marked as a mate to one of the fae, she must flee to save herself from being hunted down by the Mist Guard, protectors of the human realm, as well as the Wild Hunt, a group of fae from the Shadow Court.Before either can capture her, another fae marked named Caelum saves her, and together they seek protection with the Resistance. But their alliance quickly turns into a passionate romance that may consume them both.*This story ends on a massive cliffhangerMy Thoughts:If you're a fan of JLA's From Blood and Ash and enjoy dagger to the throat meetings, fated mates, forced proximity, 'touch her and die', 'who hurt you', possessive alphaholes, exhibitionism, praise k!nks, and breeding k!nk, you may like this.What I liked:The world-building.This is an interesting world full of Primordials, Gods, Fae, witches, and humans. By the end of book one, we have some background about the history before the Veil, but most of it is told from the human's perspective, so I'm curious to learn about it acording to the Fae. I'm also excited to see what life in the fae realm looks like!The banter was great at times.Estrella is feisty and Caelum is very persistent. All he wants to do is protect her but she's very untrusting, so whenever he pushes, she pulls. But goodness does Caelum say a lot of great things. For example:""If this is what your hate feels like, then I can't wait to feel your love.""Caelum calling Estrella 'My Star' was so sweet.This is the cutest nickname, especially since Estrella means star in Spanish. But he also calls her, 'Little One' a lot which I didn't like so much because it reminded me of Marvel's Thanos calling Gamora 'Little One'. lolThe sex scenes were intense and steamy.Literally steamy because most of them happen in hot springs. This story is definitely 18+ with lots of sexual tension and graphic sex scenes.What I didn't like:Storyline is extremely predictable.There wasn't a single plot twist that surprised me. It felt like the author was spoon-feeding the reader to the point where it was obvious where the story was headed. I felt like I was being told more than I was being shown. However, it’s still an enjoyable ride.Some of the words and phrases used were too modern or relative to our world.For example: 'ew', 'gross', and 'you're a d!ck'. Whenever used, I was taken out of the fantasy story.Other words and phrases used throughout the story were cringy, especially sexual ones. 🙈For example:- ""It was safe to say, my vag!na was unfortunately off-limits.""- ""I like my intestines in my stomach and not shoved into my lungs. You just keep that thing away from me.""- ""He tore another woman in two with his monumental c0ck?""- ""I'm not above punching you in the d!ck.""- ""I don't even mind that your p*ssy is probably still filled with his c*m from when he made you scream this morning. It feels better that way."" (This one in particular, is supposed to gross you the f*ck out but it was too much).- ""Show me my f*cking c*nt. Show them what they will never have.""- ""I'll fill you with so much of my c*m that they can smell it on you tomorrow and remember exactly who you belong to.- ""I want you to come. I want to clench that tight little p*ssy around my c0ck and milk the c*m from my balls until it's dripping down your thighs.""- References to Estrella's vag!na after sex as a ""battered p*ssy"" or ""poor p*ssy""Jensen trying to force Estrella to be a lady of the night did nothing to further the story.I hate useless plot points. And this was obviously done to piss off Caelum and have him show everyone in the Resistance that Estrella is his...which he does when he literally f*cks her in the communal hot springs baths. It just felt cheap.The exhibition was fine but didn't quite align with Caelum's character.He is so protective of Estrella and didn't want anyone to touch or think of her sexually, but he's suddenly okay with the entire Resistance watching him claim her? I feel like this was only added to shock the reader instead of actually providing any real value towards the romance or story.Overall, I was intrigued by the storyline and worldbuilding, however, the characters and romance fell short for me. Regardless, I am curious as to what happens next, so I may read the next book.Thank you Harper L. Woods for providing an eARC in exchange for an honest review!

The Coven,"“Sit, please. I have something I’d like to discuss with you first.”“Ooo… we’re using good manners. Am I in trouble?”“That depends. Do you want me to punish you, Witchling?”“Am I going to enjoy it?”“Why wouldn’t you?”I saw it all coming but.Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.Fuck.Fuuuuuuck.(‼️‼️𝐀𝐁𝐎𝐔𝐓 𝐓𝐇𝐄 ""𝐖𝐈𝐋𝐋𝐎𝐖'𝐒 𝐀𝐆𝐄"" 𝐃𝐈𝐒𝐂𝐎𝐔𝐑𝐒𝐄‼️‼️I've seen a few reviews here on GR and on Amazon where readers commented on the fact that the relationship between Willow and Grey is problematic because he's an immortal and she's 16. Now, I agree that the ""romance"" was on the toxic side (but you'll have to read the book yourself to get why I'm saying this) and I really don't care if people loved or hated this because everyone has different tastes and reasons to love or hate a book, but it'd be sad if people who haven't read this novel didn't give it a chance due to false information.The main character, Willow, is NOT 16. She is, in fact, 20 years old, and it's clearly stated in the ebook version I have.I'll add the passage where her age is mentioned under the spoiler tag:“A new witch has made herself known to us,” Susannah explained, sitting up straighter upon her dais. She looked to the lines of symmetry at her side, to the twelve witches who led each of the houses within the town. They were representatives of the original sixteen families that founded Crystal Hollow—all that remained of those noble lines in the centuries that had passed.“Then surely, she can merely attend next year? If she’s sixteen, she’s far too young to begin at Hollow’s Grove for another four years,” I said, spinning in a circle slowly as I waited for any of those gathered to echo the sentiment. Hollow’s Grove required all students to be at least twenty years of age, given the proclivities that happened within the school walls once a week when the Reaping came.[...]“She’s not sixteen, merely hidden from our sight for four years after her awakening.She is the last of a founding family, Alaric. Surely, even you can understand that it is of the utmost importance that she is brought to Hollow’s Grove immediately,” Susannah explained.“How has she remained hidden all this time? Why didn’t you know she existed before now?”So, you see, the romance is still questionable, but the fmc is not a minor as some readers claim, and if you're an avid romantasy reader who enjoys books like ACOTAR and all that jazz, you might not find the age difference that problematic, after all.I wonder, however, if the version I have is an edited one because some other people told me theirs doesn't have these paragraph I've just shared.I promise I'll get to the bottom of it 🫡𝐔𝐏𝐃𝐀𝐓𝐄: I ended up texting the author on IG and, paraphrasing, here's what she told me:She (Willow)'s always been 20. The book had a paragraph edited because some readers were confused that because witch powers manifest at 16, and Willow is a new student, then they thought that made her 16 when the reality was she was just in hiding when her powers manifested and the coven was unaware of her existence. I edited to add clarity to avoid confusion, but she was never 16. I don't roll that way 🤣 [...] I obviously wasn't clear enough in the original draft, and my editing team missed it because they all know I wouldn't write about a 16 year old.😅And then:Just wanted to thank you! Because you mentioned it. I decided to verify to be safe and downloaded the ebook that the new publisher has up and it looks like somehow in the takeover on amazon, it reverted to the previous version that doesn't have that sentence. My agent is contacting the publisher so they can fix it until the official re-release with the new edits in August.Soooooooooooo...here's the truth, people!)***🦴𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗖𝗢𝗩𝗘𝗡 - 𝗛𝗔𝗥𝗣𝗘𝗥 𝗟.

Its gothic aura emphasized by Woods' exquisite writing and the sharp edges she gifted her characters with.I love that you're catapulted into the no-frills story right away. And by this I mean that the pain starts immediately and it only grows from there.The magic system based on nature and elements was a brilliant touch.The mystery aspect of the story was well developed, as were the witch/demon lore and the characters' backstories and motivations.On a technical level, The Coven has its flaws, some bigger than others, some totally forgettable.BUT, it belongs to that particular category of books you can't help but enjoy despite the things that should tarnish it because it was everything your reader's heart needed in that moment.Right book, right time, basically.Willow is a fierce and intense protagonist, a powerful woman who lets no one walk all over her and who'd do anything for the ones she loves.I relate, but I also fangirl over her super hard.And then there's Gray.Gray...Fucking Gray.Fucking Gray, as in: Fucking (verb), Gray (direct object).Because, yes, I want to freaking smother him with a pillow right now, but I also have a very annoying crush on his sexy, betraying ass.*shakes fist* Damn you and your impossibly hot name, Alaric Grayson Thorne.Speaking of hot.The dark romance was simply magnetic. The connection between Willow andsexy assholeGray is palpable; their banter and sarcastic conversations could totally rival their steamy scenes in terms of chemistry.HLW's smut is delicious.There was a scene towards the end that had Koisty and I a little confused about our feelings about it, not gonna lie.We exchanged notes, metaphorically shook hands and agreed once again that we're both pretty much fucked up when it comes to the stuff we like in our books.So, yeah, it was good.Very good.The ending was a little predictable, honestly.I've seen the twist coming from a mile, but I enjoyed the book anyway.I guess this fact only confirms just how good this actually is.And now I can't wait for the sequel.I've picked upWhat Lies Beyond the Veillast year and ended up DNFing it, but I'm gonna give it another try someday. I think this author has the potential to become a favorite.Or maybe this is simply a book that has my name all over it.Who knows.The only certain thing I know about this book is that:""Gray being alive (or technically unalive) is enough for me to stop breathing😩""-Miss Lyra, 2023_____BR with the EMOJI GANG (🐈‍⬛Lyra, 🐠Koisty, 🦦Leni & ☀️Lila).We are cute, but we read naughty books😏",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75396525-the-coven,The Coven.txt
Beasts of Prey,"Beasts of Prey is a beautiful and powerful YA High Fantasy tale with a wonderful world of magic and African Mythology created by a Pan-African own voices author. There are several different themes that range from drug use, grief, religion, servitude and I believe possible OCD. You would think this is too many to tackle in one book but it was woven together smoothly and everything fit perfectly in its place.“Nightmares hunt like the beasts of prey. Vanquished in the light of day.”Koffi and her mother are indentured servants at the Night Zoo. They are in charge of handling one of most dangerous of all the fascinating and deadly creatures that make up the show.Ekon is an initiate, on his way to becoming one of the elite warriors of the Sons of the Six. He is desperate to make it into the brethren along side his brother and to continue his family’s legacy.Koffi and Ekon very different lives intersect after a distressed Koffi accidentally starts a fire at the Night Zoo. The Sons of the Six are sent to help extinguish the fire and round up any runaway indentures. That fire ends up starting off a chain of events that lead to Koffi and Ekon working together to hunt the Shetani, a ferocious beast that has been killing Lkossa’s citizens for years.Both of them have their own reasons for conspiring to hunt and capture the beast.Koffi needs to bring the beast to the cruel owner of the Night Zoo, so she can free herself and her mother from years of indentured services.Ekon needs the Shetani in order to change Father Olufeni’s mind about expelling him from the Sons of the Six after things went wrong while putting out the fire Koffi started. Ekon will prove he is worthy by protecting the citizens from ongoing years of terror from the mighty beast.Their journey takes them into the Greater Jungle where no Lkossan dares to travel. Along the way they cross paths with dangerous magical and mythical beasts like Anatsou the creature with the torso of a man but legs of a spider. As well as a beautiful but poisonous forest lush with unique foliage. Ekon and Koffi find that the magic they thought was long ago extinct in their world does in fact actually still exist. But as they make their trek further into the jungle they bite off more than they can chew and may not be able to find the Shetani let alone make it out alive.The story had 3 POV’s Koffi, Ekon &Adiah. Koffi & Ekons story intertwined pretty much at the beginning, so when Adiah’s character popped up and she didn’t seem to belong to their story it was a bit confusing, I kept thinking I was missing something. When I finally figured out where Adiah’s narrative was going, I was floored. Ayana Gray did a great job keeping it intriguing and mapping her story out. In fact there were many plot twists that I actually didn’t see coming and that’s hard to do with a seasoned reader.I noticed one of the genres was classified as romance on Goodreads, I can't say I agree. There is an attraction for sure but no romance. I’m wondering if AG will develop more of a relationship in the second book? But this was pretty much strictly fantasy. And I think it fit well for this story.I am looking forward to the next book in this captivating saga, to see what other adventures and troubles Koffi and Ekon will find for themselves.Thank You Penguin Teen for this gifted copy in exchange for my honest review.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56552953-beasts-of-prey,Beasts of Prey.txt
She Who Became the Sun,"I have a Booktube channel now! Subscribe here:https://www.youtube.com/petrikleoARC provided by the publisher—Tor Books—in exchange for an honest review.4.5/5 starsShe Who Became the Sunhas the bravery to pitch itself asThe Song of AchillesmeetsMulanand actually live up to it.If you’re active on bookish social media, you should know thatShe Who Became the Sunby Shelley Parker-Chan is one of the two most hyped books published by Tor Books this year; the other one beingThe Blacktongue Thiefby Christopher Buehlman. Both of these books have been received praises from many people for the past few months, and with these kinds of huge praises and buzz, there’s the tendency for them to disappoint. Now, I haven’t readThe Blacktongue Thiefyet, but the hype forShe Who Became the Sunis real and well-deserved. With such a striking cover art illustrated by JungShan Ink—the artist who illustrated the cover art toThe Poppy War Trilogyby R.F. Kuang—this historical fiction/fantasy debut managed to live up to all the praises.“Becoming nothing was the most terrifying thing she could think of—worse even than the fear of hunger, or pain, or any other suffering that could possibly arise from life.”She Who Became the Sunis the first book in Radiant Emperor duology, and it’s a reimagining of the rise of the founding emperor of the Ming Dynasty. The year is 1345, in a famine-stricken village, two children are given two fates; the boy—Zhu Chongba—is destined for greatness, and the girl is fated to become nothing. However, when a bandit attacks this village and orphans the two children, Zhu Chongba succumbs to despair and dies. The girl, with a burning desire to survive no matter what it takes, decides to take Zhu Chongba’s name and steal her brother’s fated greatness. I loved this book, and I’m genuinely impressed by how well-written this book was, especially remembering that this is a debut novel. The themes of destiny, war, gender, identity, desire, love, and duty were delivered efficiently with much impact; the importance and freedom in our power as an individual to choose, regardless of our circumstances, were spectacularly elaborated. Seriously, I would be lying if I say that I didn’t feel invigorated by Zhu’s resilience.“Monks were supposed to strive for non-attachment, but that had always been impossible for Zhu: she was more attached to life than any of them could have understood.”Yes, the main character, Zhu Chongba was undoubtedly the main highlight of the book for me. Her resilience, her cunning, and her desire to live were nothing short of inspiring to me. I’m not saying that I agree with all of her decision, but Parker-Chan’s way of crystallizing Zhu’s motivation to the readers was so superbly-written that I can’t help but felt that I understood Zhu. Zhu is overall a pragmatic character, and she’s willing to do everything in her power to defy fate, fight, live, and most importantly, she refuses to become nothing. I loved her character’s arc; her moral is colored in grey rather than black and white, and her storyline just felt so believable to me.“So I always knew you had a strong will. But what’s unusual about you is that most strong-willed people never understand that will alone isn’t enough to guarantee their survival. They don’t realize that even more so than will, survival depends upon an understanding of people and power.”Honestly speaking, Parker-Chan did such an excellent job on Zhu’s characterizations, and it made the beginning of Part II worrying for a while. Here’s the thing, Part 1 of the novel centers entirely on Zhu’s coming-of-age story, and she was the only POV character during this section; the sudden shifts to a multi-POV narrative in Part 2 of the novel took a bit of time for me to get used to, and for a while, I was terrified that this storytelling decision would end up diminishing the quality of the narrative. Fortunately, my worry was unfounded; the novel only became better because of the change to the multi-POV structure. Ma, Ouyang, and Esen are the other three main characters that, in my opinion, significantly improved the depth and emotions of the novel. Similar to Zhu, these characters have character development and characterizations that felt so organic and well-realized. The character’s respective motivations, agendas, and backgrounds that complex their emotions, relationships, and sense of duty further were so incredible that I couldn’t even imagine how the novel would be like if it was told solely from Zhu’s perspective.“Desire is the cause of all suffering. The greater the desire, the greater the suffering, and now she desired greatness itself. With all her will, she directed the thought to Heaven and the watching statues: Whatever suffering it takes, I can bear it.”I guess it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the characters and story in this novel won’t be a happy-go-lucky one. As I said at the beginning of this review,She Who Became the Sunis a reimagining of the rise of the emperor of the Ming Dynasty; if you’re familiar with the history of The Red Turban Rebellion and Zhu Yuanzhang, I’m sure you’ll recognize some—not all—characters involved in Zhu’s story. I personally think it’s more accurate to callShe Who Became the Suna historical fiction—or maybe historical fantasy—than a straight-up fantasy novel; rather than having me barraged you with essays and paragraphs of information regarding the inspirations, I think it would be better for me to give you the link to the author’s website—I advise you to check these only after you finished reading the novel—on the subject of the historical figures instead:https://shelleyparkerchan.com/histori...But regardless of genre classification, there’s one thing for sure aboutShe Who Became the Sun; it is written lyrically and wonderfully.“Learn to want something for yourself, Ma Xiuying. Not what someone says you should want. Not what you think you should want. Don’t go through life thinking only of duty. When all we have are these brief spans between our non-existences, why not make the most of the life you’re living now? The price is worth it.”Parker-Chan has an immensely desirable writing style that displays her proficiency for storytelling in practically every scene of the book. Tensions, dialogues, atmosphere, and emotions were conveyed efficaciously, and the pacing of the narrative flowed naturally without hindrance.She Who Became the Sunby Shelley Parker-Chan is a novel destined for greatness, and greatness will be achieved when the publication date has been reached. Although this is the first book in a duology, rest assured that there’s no cliffhanger, and the book worked well as a standalone. There are still 5 months before this wonderful debut comes out, and I’m already so looking forward to seeing how this duology will be concluded. Claim greatness for yourself.

The Bone Season,"In short: the publisher's overblown hype set this book up for judgment and failure, but the book itself provided the rope.I hate hype. The thing about hype is that it---unfairly, at times---sets the bar up so high that there is really nowhere to go but down. This is true especially in the case of such a young author. You throw in the name Bloomsbury, and the ""seven book series"" bit, and the J.K. Rowling comparison surely comes. It certainly sets standards extremely high, unrealistically high, that inevitably one is disappointed with anything less. And this book, while technically acceptable, is in no way comparable to the enjoyment I had from reading the first of the Harry Potter series.Granted, the premise is not the same, the audience is not the same. One fact remains: my enjoyment of the book is just not there. Take away the hype, take away the expectations, and I am only left mildly impressed at this freshman effort of a book.It is an overly ambitious infodump. It was difficult to read.I sludged through this as I would a school textbook: it was just not an enjoyable book at all, for me. Action and information takes priority over a a sensible plot and character development. The addition of a massive cast serves to only disguise the fact that the plot is a hot mess. This is not science fiction. It is fantasy, it is paranormal, there is nothing remotely resembling science in here for a book that purportedly takes place in the future.The premise: This isGameboard of the Gods, with a glossary. I oftentimes joke that in sci-fi, there really needs to be a glossary because oftentimes the terms and concepts are neither well-explained enough, nor are they explained in a timely manner. Well, ta da! I got my wish...and I wish I hadn't. It isreally badwhen there isa glossary of this length. It is not a good sign when within the first 20 pages, I am confused out of my mind, and have to read the book on two mediums, my reader and a netbook, just so I could have two versions of it open so I could constantly (and I mean constantly) refer back to the glossary.It is one thing to create a new world, it is another to immerse the reader so that they feel like they're drowning, holding onto the fucking glossary as a flotation device.It took me a long, long time to read the initial chapters, because I kept having to look things up and then memorize what they actually are. And there are. So. Many. Terms.It took me awhile to realize that this isan alternate universe of the UK; I didn't know this was so until it was mentioned that Oxford (a not-so-subtle-reference to the author's pedigreed university) was destroyed in the year 1859. Oh. That answers a lot of questions, like why the fuck is the UK, not even half a century from now, so goddamned different. Why are there oxygen bars?! Isn't oxygen kind ofrequiredfor living? Etc. Alternate London. Well, that was easy.The world building is at simultaneously overly detailed and extremely vague. Very, very, very specific information is given only when it pleases the author to do so. There is a lot of information (information is the word of the day, in the context of this book) given to uswhen it's convenient for the author to do so. People with clairvoyance are feared and hated and hunted down---the reasons is never explained clearly enough for my satisfaction. There is little history, little background, little explanation to why things are this way or that, nothing to make us feel like this could be an actual world.As quickly as we are dumped into this setting from a 50-foot plank, we're immediately plunked intoyet another underground world. An secret world set in an alternate universe. It's so veryInception, is it not? We've got clairvoyants, seers, etc., in one world, and we're dumped into Sheol I, in which there are Emims and Rephaites, and there's more info-dumping on them. God save us all.The characters: The characters and the setting are gloriously sterile. They left me emotionless.You could easily kill any of the main characters off 90% through and I wouldn't even blink, much less shed a microscopic tear. The book didn't give any of the characters personality or character development until the author suddenly remembers, oh, I should probably insert _____ poignant moment in here at _____ appropriate time.Paige Mahoney is our special snowflake of the day. She is the daughter of an eminent scientist within the Scion scientific research division, and has had a very privileged life due to her father's status and importance. She doesn't want it.I’d always hated school: the uniform, the dogma. Leaving was the high point of my formative years.I always hate it when characters act stupidly contrary like this. Guess what, Paige? It's life. You are not special. School is expected, as are following the rules. Nobody likes it, but we do it because it's the mature thing to do. Making a character a special snowflake is a surefire way to guarantee that I will not like her. Paigejust doesn't feel like she belongs in the average life. She's meant for something more. So instead of settling into a mundane life like the rest of us (and therefore saving me from having to read this book), Paige joins the clairvoyant version of the Mafia.For a book that is told from a first-person narrative, I got no sense of Paige's personality or any sort of complexity or development as the book progresses. Her narrative is comprised of more action than thoughts.Take away the plot, and you are left with a book of YA PNR tropes and clichés. The jealous queen bee, the darkly mysterious guy, the girl with special powers.There is a very large cast of characters about whom I could not care less. Short of a few main characters, the rest of the cast are largely extraneous and utterly forgettable.The romance: utterly forced. Utterly unnecessary. Not well-built at all. Came out of nowhere. To summarize: Paige gets rescued/captured by the Rephaim as she is about to die (so terribly convenient), and is told that she is part of Bone Season XX---which starts...NOW!(Again, so terribly convenient). The Rephaite captures people and save them for every 10 years to compete in this special contest to see who gets to be their special servants, a red-jacket (as opposed to the regular servants, who are just performers---harlies).Shock of all shocks, Paige notices one particular Rephaite, a very-super-extra-good-looking one (among the merely really-good-looking ones).One of the Rephaim was looking at me.His gaze cleaved straight to mine, as if he’d been waiting for me to look, watching for a flicker of dissent. His skin was a dark honey gold, setting off two heavy-lidded yellow eyes. He was the tallest of the five males, with coarse brown hair, clothed in embroidered black. Wrapped around him was a strange, soft aura, overshadowed by the others in the room. He was the single most beautiful and terrible thing I’d ever laid eyes on.Shockingly, he picks Paige to be his Special Girl. She gets to be his servant! She's soooooooooooo special, because guess what?“You have attracted the attention of the blood-consort: Arcturus, Warden of the Mesarthim. He has decided to be your keeper.”“It is rare that he takes interest in a human...You are very, very fortunate.”Fuck me. Facepalming so hard.Their romance is forced and stretched. It is a prison-guard/mentor type of a relationship, only...not, because clearly, certainly the author is setting us up for romance somewhere along the way. The ""like,"", the love, the gradual building up of the relationship never felt realistic, it never felt natural; when it finally came, it just left me utterly cold and disbelieving.The writing is technically well-done, the action scenes are acceptable, but is entirely too dependent on the use ofDeus ex Machinaas a plot device. The plot is a mess. It is peppered through with flashbacks that tried to give me insight into Paige's character, and while that worked somewhat, it just took too long to get to the point, and I felt the majority of the flashbacks...as with the book...were largely useless and noncontributing to the book in general.Undoubtedly, this book has a lot of fans already, based on the huge numbers of glowing reviews. I, for one, remain highly skeptical. If this is indeed to be a 7-book series, I'm not sure where it will lead, but I know will not follow.The ending is meant to leave us wanting more...but I'd rather spend my summer at the Dursleys.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/195391688-the-bone-season,The Bone Season.txt
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone,"It's Always Great, Coming back Home..There's a reason us, the Fans, feel that we're connected, no matter where we from, different culture, ethics, ages..we're all graduated from there....Hogwarts.. even like we were in same class,classmates, no matter which edition we read....Cause Harry Potter is not just a story..it's a Life..The Boy WhoSavedFlourished the Book IndustryIt's One of the most important novels in modern history, Sorry, it'sThe Most Important ONE.This Review also for those who hate the series !Please bear with me..Without it, most Book stores & publishers may have the same fate of Video Stores like Blockbuster LLC, which, despite being super popular in the 90s, closed all the stores by 2013, shutting down forever.Yes, without this Novel, and with the rapid change in technology, the ease of making e-books and reading it in PCs, Smartphones, Tablets..etc, the publishing and trade of new paper books may decrease rapidly.It'd be limited for religious or educating books, classics, small novels. Even those could be just electronic too, and the Books be just like Good Ol' Video Tapes.A Dystopia, right? very gloomy idea to the world without This novel,The One.Well, in the case you think I'm exaggerate..Let's have,ABrief !!History of Literature in the 90s-------------------------------Well, let’s back to early 90s , where TV is in every house, even in every room, Video sets are there too, rental video stores everywhere, satellite receivers and cable channels growing fast packed with channels for kids & teenagers, making them attached more & more into screens,not to mention Video Games, Game boy and Nintendo…Those of this new generation who read are “weirdos"" or ""nerds” to the rest of their peers.And for those “few who read”, book stores mostly got for them comics and graphic novels, which most of them created early this century.Classic Novels, they read just for Schools and Classes mostly.And New Novels that make Best Seller are the ones made, or will be made, into movies for Julia Roberts, Tom Cruse or any of the 90s Hollywood celebrity, or the ones by Stephen King because ,of course, will be made into movies too.Even these new novels didn't live up the selling numbers of Tolkien, Charles Dickens, Agatha Christie-what’s with the British authors and selling numbers :)?-, also in Russia no more Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, no more Hugo in France, inEgyptno more like Naguib Mahfouz & the great authors of the 50s to 70s..No new Big Hit for novels, most of the selling books are those of Speculation about strange & mysterious things in the world or in religion, Dream interpretation , cocking books or celebrities rumors.While in US & UK, Top Selling books mostly the Self Help ones, or those teaching Computers Programming and Web Sites-this brand new huge technology leap back then-No new novels to attract the new generation of kids and teenagers, There's few Successful Highlights though, like R.L.Stine’s Goosepumbs in 1992 which made a very good success, and translated in many countries including Egypt.And in Egypt there’s also a very successful project by respectful Publishing house that made “Pocket Novels” for youth, by brilliant Egyptian writers presenting huge variety of novels of many genres, Sci-Fi, Action Thriller, comics, Romance .etc.There’s also “Reading for All”, project by the first lady “Susan Mubarak”, reprinting a huge verity of important books and novels from all over the world in very cheap prices.But all these effort didn't attract “more and more” of new youth readers as intended, it just made more and more books for those few who already reads.The vast numbers of those who don’t just read will increase if there isn't a BIG new attractiveReading Experienceto get them into reading, specially with the more channels, more movies.But the BIGGEST Obstacle for them to read came out in1994, and became a real phenomenon by 1995....it’sPlaystation, The giant Japanese Gaming leap..Football, Crash, Pepsi man, even the comics heroes also have their games, so why reading Superman, Batman’s comics when you can play them..~~~~~~ A beat. ~~~~~~So by 1996, with this growing leap in Gaming, also the Computer 3D games getting much improved, Books get replaced bit by bit by a gaming controls.So do you think it’s wise for publishers to publish a book for new writer?Of course not, it may not even cover it’s publishing cost.So it was very normal when in this year, 1996, whenJoanne, a 31 years old lady from England , handed the manuscript of her first novel to 12 publishing houses, all of them rejected it...A manuscript of over 200 pages of a novel,that she had hard times in her personal and professional life while writing it,and for children??? Seriously is there still any Child left who still read? it’s 1996, the Era of Playstation and Video Games.But then, the Modest“Bloomsbury“agreed to publish it , with 2 advises for her, first that she’d get a day job, since it’s a little chance of making money in children's books.- later she received a grant from the Scottish Arts Council to help her continuing writing.-But the significant advice was to change her pen name cause young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman..So with her name & her grandmother’s ""Kathleen"" come the 2 initial of her pen name..J . k . RowlingAnd in26 June 1997, with 1,000 copies, 500 of which were distributed to libraries, come out in UK, to our World The Greatest..Harry Potter and the Philosopher's StoneAnd Bam!! , everything happened so fast..Before the end of this year the novel was awarded many important literary awards in the UK.An American important publisher, Scholastic, won the rights to publish the novel in US, with a huge check Rowling would never dreams of.Just with small change, 'Philosopher's Stone' to be 'Sorcerer's Stone', as the American publisher feared 'Philosopher's' may not be that attractive to young readers..And Thanks to Harry Potter, now Every young readers worldwide know much more about Philosopher's Stone's legend.In1998Book Two released in UK ,1999in US, winning more literary prizes. And becoming NO.1 Top Selling Book in UK , US and many other countries which start to publish the translated first book.And on8 July 1999, TheFirst Breaking Recordmade when Book Three sold68.000 copiesin just three days after its release in the United Kingdom.. and more copies when it released late 1999 in US..With the fast growing popularity of Harry Potter among readers, more records had been broken..The 3 books takeover the Top Spot in all charts of Best Selling Books for weeks & months, and it's even still in hardcover editions.This conquer of the Top Spots made some literary magazines & newspapers separate the 'Harry Potter books' selling records from the rest of the top selling books, splitting the lists into 'Children Books' and 'Adult Books' sections, under pressure from other publishers who were eager to see their books given higher ranking.And then it was year 2000 , where everything is about to change ... forever..The Playstation 2 is out there, and even higher leap in Computer Games..But even with this much of temptations, thousands of children, teens and parents gathered in the Midnight of8 July 2000in UK and US at the same day in front of stores, not in front of Cinemas as usual, not electronic stores as Apple storesas happening theses days, But it was in front ofBookstores, for The First time in the Book Stores History, to buy a copy of...Harry Potter and the Goblet of FireAnd They didn't mind to find out that the book is over 700 page, it was even for their pleasure, more than double the size of any of the first 3 novels.. double the thriller, double the fun..Over 3 million copies sold at that day only in the US , a New World Record, totally unexpected one.Huge story, bigger plot , mysterious and very well written.And more literate prizes for Rowling... more translated editions to more than 40 language.And a huge budget for the upcoming first movie of the series, which beautifully visualize the magic of the novel by the faithful producers and the director...and it also made some Cinematic Records back then,but that's not our subject now.~~~~~~ ~~~~~~With the announcement of pushing the publishing date of Book Five to mid. 2003 , and with 2 movies out so far, The Hunger for reading Harry Potter kept on..So, As more readers from this generation start to increase , Publishers and Book Stores start to promote for more books for those readers who are hungry for more..Older Fantasy books , like Lord of the Rings-which was a super successful movie by then too-Narnia , Golden Compass and many other novels start getting more reprinted editions. And so Book Stores prosperity increased as it get more and more readers.More countries welcomed the Harry Potter phenomenon.. The English edition AND the local translated ones , both been sold everywhere worldwide.Even inEgyptEnglish edition sold at many books stores. And, hopefully, some New Book Stores specialized in English novels and books start to open in Cairo & Alexandria by 2002-2003..And in summer 2002, after the Movie wild success, Nahdet Masr publishing house got the rights and published the Arabic edition.Although it cut some of the lines for length issues, the edition still hold the magic of it ..making a very good sales.~~~~~~ ~~~~~~The good news is, the literary movement didn't stop there, Harry Potter and Reprinted Classics. No , there's more new books come out for the increasing demand from the readers..By2002,Life of Pi, Man Booker winner make very good sales numbers.And inApril 2003Dan Brown(previously published 3 novels, making good sales)released a novel that made Huge Fuss around and making a new sales records,The Da Vinci Code..The funny thing that there's a reference in this novel that Harry Potter is 'the Second Most Selling Book in History after the Bible', a speculation that happens to be true in less than 5 years after that.A month later,May 2003, Khaled Hosseini released his first novel,The Kate Runnerwhich also made a very good records too.-Don't you agree if there's no Harry Potter before, this Afghan-born author would have a chance? He'd be rejected by 12 publishers like you know who :)-And all that didn't affect the main reason for this new 'Literal Renaissance'.All that didn't affect the Records Breaker to break records one month later..On20 June 2003book Five'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'comes out..Ten thousands of all ages conquer the Book Stores in UK, US and other countries too at the same day to get The One Book they've been waiting for at least 2 years.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"(A) 86%| ExtraordinaryNotes:A bittersweet bewitchment: all stumble-back and rally, the touchy truth of bitter youth, and fevered feelings to finale.*Check out progress updates for detailed commentary:Progress updates:08/04/2020- 2%(1) Voldemort: ""I understand those things that I did not understand before. I must be the one to kill Harry Potter, and I shall be.""- Interesting how, despite not hearing the prophesy, Voldemort came to the same solution on his own. Albeit for different reasons.(2) Bellatrix is the worst kind of groupie.(3) Tonks and Lupin are married already? I guess they eloped.08/05/2020- 4%(1) I don't want to attribute symbolism where there might be none, but wizards really do react to their wands being broken like they've been gelded.(2) ""The idea of a teenage Dumbledore was simply odd, like trying to imagine a stupid Hermione or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt.""- Hermione has been plenty stupid before. It's just that hers has to do with common sense.08/06/2020- 6%(1) ""What did you say to one another at the end of sixteen years' solid dislike?""- I mean, saying nothing is always an option, that is, if you dislike them enough to not even want to talk.(2) It wouldn't surprise me at all if Dedalus Diggle was modeled after the White Rabbit. He's short, constantly checks his giant pocket watch, and always worries about being late.08/07/2020- 8%(1) Re Polyjuice: '""Ooh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, Harry,"" said Hermione, before catching sight of Ron's raised eyebrows, blushing slightly.'- Foreshadowing the later Ron subplot.(2) '""Hold tight now, Ron,"" said Tonks, and Harry saw Ron throw a furtive, guilty look at Lupin before placing his hands on ... her waist.'- Well, can't look too eager.08/08/2020- 11%(1) Lupin: ""Expelliarmus is a useful spell, Harry, but the Death Eaters seem to think it is your signature move, and I urge you not to let it become so!""- Exactly what I've been saying!(2) 'Hermione flew at [Ron] and hugged him tightly. ""I thought — I thought —""""I'm all right,"" said Ron, patting her on the back.""'- Ah, Ron's learning. Last hug he patted her head.08/09/2020- 15%(1) ""[Harry looked] into [Mrs. Weasley's] eyes, noticing as he did so that they were precisely the same shade of brown as Ginny's.""- Focus, Harry! She's not Ginny!(2) Ron's addicted to hugs now... well, hugging Hermione.(3) ""Gabrielle ... threw Harry a glowing look, batting her eyelashes. Ginny cleared her throat loudly.""- That's right, girl. Mark your territory.08/10/2020- 18%(1) Harry's already got Ginny, so why does Ron gift him a book on getting girls?(2) ""You've really got an eye for that sort of thing.""""Thank you, Ron!"" said Hermione, looking both pleased and a little confused. Harry [smiled] to himself. He had a funny notion that he would find a chapter on compliments [in] his copy of Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches.08/11/2020- 21%(1) '""Come and dance,"" [Ron] added abruptly to Hermione. She looked taken aback, but pleased too, and got up. They vanished together into the growing throng on the dance floor.""Ah, they are together now?"" asked Krum, momentarily distracted.""Er — sort of,"" said Harry.'- Harry being a total bro.- Krum seems allayed by this news, like a suspicion's been proven true.08/12/2020- 23%(1) Harry: ""We just need to wipe their memories.""Ron: ""But I've never done a Memory Charm.""Hermione: ""Nor have I ... but I know the theory.""- Didn't Hermione do a memory charm on her parents? I guess there's a difference between erasing a memory and implanting false ones.(2) Ron takes every chance to hug Hermione. So he's either an opportunist or formed a habit.08/13/2020- 26%(1) ""[Hermione's] fingers inches from Ron's. Harry wondered whether they had fallen asleep holding hands. The idea made [Harry] feel strangely lonely.""- Classic third-wheel talk right there.(2) Ron: ""Elf magic isn't like wizard's magic... I mean, they can Apparate and Disapparate in and out of Hogwarts when we can't.""- Wizarding common sense is why Ron's valuable.08/14/2020- 29%(1) Re arresting Muggle-borns: ""I'll tell everyone Hermione's my cousin.""Hermione covered Ron's hand with hers and squeezed it. ""Thank you, Ron, but I couldn't let you.""""You won't have a choice,"" said Ron fiercely, gripping her hand back.""- Ah, the old Abram and Sarai in Egypt trick.(2) ""Mundungus dived for the stairs: Ron rugby-tackled him.""- See, Ron's useful.08/15/2020- 32%(1) ""Harry felt sure [Ron and Hermione] were looking at each other behind his back, communicating silently.""- Classic third-wheel talk right there.(2) '""Snape, headmaster! Snape in Dumbledore's study — Merlin's pants!""

Mrs. Cattermole.'- Well, glad she has a flaw.08/17/2020- 37%(1) ""Hermione was watching Ron fret over the fate of the Cattermoles, and there was such tenderness in her expression that Harry felt almost as if he had surprised her in the act of kissing him.""- Hermione swoons over sensitive Ron.

King of Scars,"”I’d like nothing better than another opportunity to talk,” said Nikolai. “But I’m afraid I have more bad news.”Genya slumped in her chair. “There’s more?”“This is Ravka,” said Zoya. “There’s always more.”I swear this quote is SUCH. A. MOOD!!! *lol* The entire book is nothing but bad news and well, yeah this is Ravka. There’s always more bad news to come. XD Leigh didn’t just nail it with those words; she also set the pace for this doulogy! To be honest I had no idea this was going to be a doulogy and after finishing “King of Scars” I have absolutely no clue how she wants to wrap this all up. There are so many things that need to be addressed and the mere idea of facing them all in the next book is already making me look like a copy of Edvard Munch’s “The Scream”. (Which is one of my favourite paintings btw ;-P)Still, I trust Leigh and I know she’ll write a phenomenal sequel. She did with “Crooked Kingdom” and I have no doubt that she’ll do it with “Rule of Wolves” as well. This said, the pacing of this book was kind of surprising. I mean I certainly didn’t expect it to be so slow at the beginning. There was a lot of information we needed to get in order to understand the current situation of Ravka and to say it’s precarious wouldn’t even get close to the truth. I guess if you’d just say that they are screwed you’d strike home. *lol*So yes, there’s a lot of build-up and all the new players are introduced and evenly spread on the chessboard. I think in a lot of ways this was a very serious book and even though Zoya’s and Nikolai’s banter was one of the highlights in “King of Scars” there were a lot of severe moments that ultimately forced our beloved characters to grow. Which is always a good thing in my book! You know I’m a sucker for character arcs and to see Nina, Zoya and Nikolai work things out was more than just amazing. Before I spoil anything I better just head over to my character section and write it all off my chest! ;-)The characters:Welcome to Ravka where bad news are the standard and scary winged creatures turn into kings during the day! *lol* The good news is: There’s a lot to talk about! The bad news is that you’ll be spoiled like crazy if you continue to read. So whatever you do, keep in mind that it was your own choice! ;-)Nikolai:”I’ll find a way. All his life, Nikolai had believed that. His will had been enough to shape not only his fate but his own identity. He had chosen what he wanted people to see – the obedient son, the feckless rogue, the able soldier, the confident politician. The monster threatened all of that.”I know a lot of people said that Nikolai isn’t the charming Nikolai from the Grisha trilogy anymore and that they didn’t like this. In my opinion this was only realistic though. I mean how is he supposed to be his charming and carefree self if there is a monster living inside of him? He’s trying to save Ravka from hostile countries, he’s dealing with a lot of problems in his own country and he’s working really hard on uniting his people. And all this even though he turns into a monster at night. I can’t even imagine how exhausted he truly is. Yet he still keeps up appearances and gives Ravka his all. I love that about Nikolai. He’s a man of his people, his country always comes first and he’d do everything to protect his land and the people within it. So yes, Nikolai might not be as easy-going as he used to be but he has thousands of reasons to be the way he is. My poor boy deserves a break and whenever I read about how much he loves Ravka and how tired he is my heart broke for him. T_T Can we get a happy Nikolai in the next book, please?! <333”Nikolai looked again at the old map of Ravka – violent, hopeless, unappeasable in its constant need. Ravka was his first love, an infatuation that had begun in his lonely boyhood and that had only deepened with age. Whatever it demanded, he knew he would give. He’d been reckless with this country he claimed to love, and he could no longer let his fear dictate Ravka’s future.””I think I can fix it,” he said at last. “I’ve always known Ravka is broken, and I’ve seen the way it breaks people in return. The wars never cease. The trouble never stops. But I can’t help believing that somehow, I’ll find a way to outsmart all of the kings who came before and set this country right.” He shook his head and laughed. “It is the height of arrogance.””Nikolai had always understood that he and Ravka were the same. He just hadn’t understood how: He was not the crying child or even the drowning man. He was the forever soldier, eternally at war, unable to ever lay down his arms and heal.Zoya:”She intended to find a way to protect Grisha throughout the world so no one would ever have to live in fear or hide their gifts again – a governing body with representatives from every nation to hold their countries accountable, a guarantee of rights and of punishment for anyone who tried to imprison or harm her kind.I already said it in one of my updates and I’ll say it again: Zoya is like a good wine that gets better with time. She’s an acquired taste and I love her for it! *lol* I kinda lived and breathed for the little snippets we got about her life and her background story was truly heart-breaking. Liliyana sounded like such a great person and it’s so sad that she died when the Darkling expanded the Fold. Also I can’t believe her parents wanted to marry off Zoya at the tender age of 9!!! Like WTH is wrong with you people?! *GRRR* I’m really glad she managed to escape that marriage and became a Grisha instead. I never thought I’d grow so fond of her insulting tongue but haha she really grew on me in this one. Also OMG! Now that she has Juris’s power will she be able to turn into a dragon too?! Because damn it, I’d be so down for a Zoya dragon in the next book! XD That way she couldn’t just spit fire with her sharp tongue but actually well, you know, SPIT FIRE!!! *lol* I’m ready for it Leigh! Just bring it on! ;-)”What will I do with this? Look at my old face?” said Liliyana. “Send it to your mother as a peace offering.”“It’s a gift for you,” Zoya replied. “So you can look into it each morning and see the most beautiful person I’ve ever known.””But the Darkling saw me clearly even then. ‘Is that really what you wish to say?” he asked.”Zoya pushed a dark strand of her hair behind her ear. “So I told him the truth. I put my chin up and said, ‘They can all hang. It was my blood in the snow.”Nina:”Saints, she missed him. The ache of his absence felt like a hook lodged inside her heart. The hurt was always there, but in moments like these, it was as if someone had seized hold of the line and pulled.”Ahhhhh!!! Nina was so savage in this! And I kinda liked it? XD What’s wrong with me? *lol* On the one hand Nina’s POV repeatedly ripped out my heart because the way her thoughts revolved around Matthias was just painful but on the other hand to see how strong she became also made me kind of proud? I mean Nina was always a very strong-willed character and did things her own way, but the Nina of “King of Scars” was on an entirely new level! I mean WOAH! The way she dealt with the Wellmother and basically everyone else who got in her way. Boy, that girl means business! Yet she’s still compassionate, gentle and kind. I think her experiences just made her a little more... I dunno ruthless? She knows none of the Fjerdans would show her mercy so she pays them back in kind. I’m very curious how she’ll develop and which kind of person she’ll be at the end of this duology. No matter what happens I’ll always love my Waffle Queen and that will never change! <3 (Also to everyone who watched “Shadow and Bone”: I loved Nina in there! I’m totally besotted with Netflix Nina. *lol*)”Nina tucked two tiny quail eggs into her skirts in case Trassel had a taste for the finer things, and found herself wondering if they might finish with sugared almond cookies. One could plot violent espionage and still hope for dessert.””I told you I would pray for you,” said Nina as she closed the door and issued her final command to her soldiers: Give her the mercy she deserves.Nina turned her back on the Wellmother’s screams.”The Saints, Yuri and The Darkling:”Most of us can hide our greatest hurts and longings. It’s how we survive each day. We pretend the pain isn’t there, that we are mad of scars instead of wounds. The hive does not grant me the luxury of that lie. I cannot go on this way. None of us can.”Okay, I admit it: I never saw that plot line coming! Not even in my wildest dreams would I have imagined that Leigh would introduce us to living saints and that we’d actually get to know some of them more closely. So that caught me totally off guard. I didn’t like Yuri right from the beginning because he was your typical religious fanatic and well as it turned out to have him around was a big mistake. I knew something was up with Elizaveta but I would have never expected her to go that far! Like OMG! Why??!! Juris’s and Zoya’s friendship was great and Grigori kind of grew on me too. It’s a shame both of them had to die because Elizaveta wanted to resurrect the Darkling and I can’t believe... I CAN’T BELIEVE she actually succeeded! I swear: The Darkling in Yuri’s body at the ending was... THE. DEATH. OF. ME!!! I can’t even!!! No, no I can’t! I mean I love the Darkling but OH GOSH!!! I think I might need a little time to digest this. *lol*”Stop punishing yourself for being someone with a heart. You cannot protect yourself from suffering. To live is to grieve.”The relationships & ships:Zoya & Nikolai:Zoya batted Nikolai’s quaking hands away from his buttons and took up the work herself. Through the thin cotton, she could feel the chill the night had left on his skin.“What an excellent valet you make,” he murmured. But she knew he hated submitting to these small attentions, hated that he was weak enough to require them.I SHIP IT! Badly! I never thought I’d say this but Zoya and Nikolai are made for each other. They both know how to deal with court problems, they are strong and independent and they obviously have a soft spot for each other! <3 I loved the level of trust that is between them and they had so many little moments together. Their love is something that grows slowly like a delicate flower and I can’t wait for them to realize how much they mean to each other. Nikolai comparing her to a strong drink was everything! *lol* We all know Nikolai could handle her and I want them to kiss and confess their love for each other! Also their banter!!! It’s superior! I think Zoya might be exactly what Ravka needs and who knows, now that she’ll be some sort of saint people will probably accept her at his side? I really hope those two will have a HEA because they both deserve it! Nikolai needs a woman like Zoya and I’m convinced Zoya needs a man like Nikolai. So can they already kiss, please?! *lol*”Zoya, say something spiteful.”“Why?” she asked faintly.“Because I’m fairly certain I’m hallucinating, and in my dreams you’re much nicer.”“You’re an idiot, Nikolai.”“Not your best work.””In that moment, he wished things might have been different. That he might not die tomorrow. That he could be led by his heart instead of duty.Because Zoya was not kind and she was not easy.But she was already a queen.””Of course I’ll come back,” he said. “I don’t trust anyone else to deliver my eulogy.”A smile curled her lips. “You’ve written it already?”“It’s very good. You’d be surprised how many synonyms there are for handsome.”Zoya closed her eyes. She turned her face, letting her cheek rest against this palm. “Nikolai –“Nina & Hanne:”Nina studied her. There was something relentless in her features – the cheekbones sharp, the nose rigorously straight. Only the full thrust of her lips gave any hint of softness. It was a challenging face, stubborn in its lines. Beautiful.”Mhmm... To be frank I don’t know how I feel about this new ship. I mean we all know I love a good f/f rep in my books and Nina deserves someone who will lover her the way she is. I’m just not sure that person is Hanne. I wasn’t convinced by their chemistry and it came out of nowhere. Like suddenly there is Hanne and Nina thinks she’s beautiful but she’s still grieving for Matthias so idk. *shrugs* And then she’s Jarl Brum’s child?! I mean I’m currently very fond of K-Dramas but Nina having a relationship with Brum’s child? I’ve a tough time imagining it. Guess only time will tell if I’ll be persuaded by this ship or not.”If I had just been a boy. If I had been the son my father wanted ...”Nina gripped Hanne’s shouders. “You are perfect, Hanne. That your father can’t value your strength speaks only to his weakness.”Ehri & Isaak:”A reasonable gambit, but not one I was prepared to make.”He studied her. “Not when you could simply wait for a pensive king to amble by and find you looking like a painting in green silk with flower in your hair?” Her golden eyes shifted away guiltily. “How long were you waiting, hoping I might stroll by?”She bit her lip. “Two hours and twelve minutes. Give or take.”This was straight out of a Greek tragedy and I was really shook by this turn of events! Isaak grew on me and I really liked that boy and then BAM! Leigh killed him through Princess Ehri who wasn’t even Princess Ehri to begin with. They were both posing as someone they were not and actually fell in love. This love story was nothing but tragic and I’m still sad about it. They both deserved better and at another place and at another time they might have even been able to become lovers. T_T It’s so heart-breaking. It’s on the same level as Romeo and Juliet and ahhh my heart is still bleeding for those two. RIP Isaak! You did well, you were a great king and you could have been so much more! <333She pressed a soft kiss to his lips. “My only comfort is that you never could have been mine. But know that I would have gladly been yours.”“Ehri,” he moaned as the world began to go dark.“Not Ehri.”Conclusion:“King of Scars” started out way more slowly than I thought it would, but the last couple of chapters totally made up for the slow beginning! My mind is still reeling from all those revelations and it might take a couple of days until I digested this ending. All told, I enjoyed this immensely and I can’t wait to dive into the next book. Now that the stage is set I expect an epic finale in “Rule of Wolves” and tell you what? I’m ready! ;-)",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36307634-king-of-scars,King of Scars.txt

In the film they actually work! Film Luna is treated as more of an eccentric than the books, where she's sort of a lovable gullible.07/01/2020- 26%Ginny be like: ""Get a room you two.""(1) It's a mark of Ron and Hermione's closeness that she's comfortable enough to hit him repeatedly with a book, and he's comfortable enough to let her.(2) Nearly Headless Nick: ""I would rather die than betray [Harry's] trust.""Ron: ""That's not saying much, seeing as you're already dead.""- Ron again with the common sense.07/02/2020- 29%Finally!

Just 10 pages later, Harry smells something flowery and turns to see Ginny.- Not exactly subtle.07/03/2020- 33%(1) The House of Gaunt has a very Craster's Keep vibe to it.(2) Merope seems right out of a Jane Austen novel.(3) Dumbledore: ""The Gaunts [were] noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins.""- Not so different than European royals, then... and a fair bit better than Egyptians.07/04/2020- 36%(1) Ron gets attention from Lavender, Hermione gives him the cold shoulder. Hermione congratulates Ron, Lavender walks off grumpy. Meanwhile, Ron's totally oblivious.(2) Harry: ""But wasn't that dishonest, Hermione?

She also tells Ron ""Hermione snogged Viktor Krum."" Enraged and shamed, Ron snogs stalkerish Lavender Brown. Ergo, Ginny's to blame for that mess.07/09/2020- 48%Ron makes Hermione cry on stairs a lot.(1) Ron: ""She can't complain ... She snogged Krum. So she's found out someone wants to snog me too ... I haven't done anything wrong.""- Ron's not wrong, but misses the point.(2) Hermione: ""He's at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes ...

Not useful, but it's the thought that counts.(2) '""Harry, you've got a maggot in your hair,' said Ginny cheerfully, leaning across the table to pick it out; Harry felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot.'- Most romantic maggot scene in fiction?07/13/2020- 56%(1) ""Abstinence"" is the new common room password. Sneaky, having students recite it repeatedly.(2) Harry: ""Hermione, can't you [make up with Ron]?""Hermione: ""No, I can't... So don't even ask.""- Can't or won't?(3) ""The contents proved difficult to empty into the Pensieve, as though they had congealed slightly; did memories go bad?""- Eh, only the regrettable ones.07/14/2020- 58%(1) Hermione: ""Oh, well, if Won-Won thinks that, you'd better do it ... After all, when has Won-Won's judgment ever been faulty?""- It's contagious! Now Hermione's saying ""Won-Won."" Sarcasm, yes, but ""Won-Won"" regardless.(2) ""Friends they might be, but if Ron started calling Lavender 'Lav-Lav,' [Harry] would have to put his foot down.""- The buck stops at ""Lav-Lav""!07/15/2020- 60%Poor Lavender :((1) Hermione: ""Golpalott's Third Law states that the antidote for a blended poison will be equal to more than the sum of the antidotes for each of the separate components.""- That makes no sense! How can something be equal to more than a sum? It would just be greater than it!(2) The gif never happens in the book, but it's my favorite scene :)07/16/2020- 62%(1) ""[Harry] was now being dogged wherever he went by Cormac McLaggen and Lavender Brown. He could not decide which of them was more annoying.""- I vote Lavender.(2) ""Harry's imagination zoomed into overdrive ... Ginny, weeping over his lifeless form, confessed her feelings of deep attraction to him while Ron gave them his blessing.""- Pretty passive ambition there.07/17/2020- 64%(1) Lavender: ""Is Hermione Granger still visiting [Ron]?""Harry: ""Yeah, I think so. Well, they're friends, aren't they?""Lavender: ""Friends, don't make me laugh ... She didn't talk to him for weeks after he started going out with me! But I suppose she wants to make up with him now he's all interesting.""- Now we know what Lavender looks for in a partner. Interesting.07/18/2020- 68%(1) Lavender to Ron: ""Why didn't you tell me you were getting out today? And why was she with you?""- I suppose a condition of being Lavender's boyfriend is having to cut loose all your female friends.(2) Voldemort: ""You are omniscient as ever, Dumbledore.""Dumbledore: ""Oh no, merely friendly with the local barmen.""- That's some stealthy foreshadowing there.07/19/2020- 71%(1) Ron: ""I love you, Hermione.""Hermione: ""Don't let Lavender hear you saying that.""Ron: ""I won't ... Or maybe I will ... then she'll ditch me.""- Essentially, that's what happened in the film.(2) The Imperius Curse = Temporary insanity defense.(3) Harry supposes Tonks was in love with Sirius, which no one thinks is weird. Wizard views on incest are oddly casual.07/20/2020- 73%(1) Ron: ""Quick, hide me!""Hermione: ""It isn't Lavender!""- If it were Lavender, I think hiding behind Hermione would make things much worse.(2) Harry hesitates to use his vial of Felix Felicis, having saved it to break up Ginny and Dean. Luckily, that happened as a side effect of his Slughorn mission. So, bonus points.- Incidentally, Harry's low-key a homewrecker.07/21/2020- 75%(1) '""What were you doing up there with her?"" shrieked Lavender Brown, staring right through Harry at Ron and Hermione emerging together from the boys' dormitories.'- Lavender's suspicions confirmed!- Lucky all around... except Lavender.(2) Slughorn: ""Had a house-elf taste every bottle after what happened to your poor friend Rupert.""- I see what she did there :)07/22/2020- 78%(1) '""You have [uncommon skill and power],"" said Dumbledore firmly. ""You have a power that Voldemort has never had. You can —""""I know!"" said Harry impatiently. ""I can love!"" It was only with difficulty that he stopped himself adding, ""Big deal!"".'- I had the same reaction as Harry to the ending of ""The Fifth Element."" ""Really? Love is the greatest power there is?""07/23/2020- 82%(1) Flitwick: ""A little less talk, a little more action.""- Wasn't that an Elvis song? No, wait, that was ""A Little Less Conversation.""(2) Harry's mind: ""She's Ron's sister. But she's ditched Dean! She's still Ron's sister. I'm his best mate! That'll make it worse. If I talked to him first — He'd hit you. What if I don't care? He's your best mate!""- Ron, Ron, Ron.07/24/2020- 85%(1) Ginny: ""All Romilda Vane does is ask me if it's true you've got a hippogriff tattooed across your chest ... I told her it's a Hungarian Horntail ... Much more macho.""- Harry's already kinda got a lightning bolt tattoo, and on his face too! I'd guess that's be even more macho.(2) ""Rage and resentment fought shock and excitement.""- Fight it! Angst was so Book 5.07/25/2020- 86%(1) Perhaps Harry's grown too used to magic. He's fine charging headlong into danger, but a short swim in cold water totally freaks him out. Who is he? Film-Ron?(2) ""Harry had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise.""- I wonder if he's referring to Seamus, who's gimmick is he often accidentally blows things up?07/26/2020- 87%(1) How is Harry shocked that blood magic is a thing? Voldemort was revived by his blood!(2) Dumbldore: ""You are underage and unqualified. Voldemort would never have expected a sixteen-year-old to reach this place: I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine.""- So... Harry should be glad the alarm can't detect his negligible amount of magic.07/27/2020- 88%(1) Harry needs blood to open the archway. Luckily, he was already cut whilst fighting Inferi. Even zombies have a silver lining.(2) '""It's going to be all right, sir,"" Harry said over and over again ... ""Don't worry...""""I am not worried, Harry,"" said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. ""I am with you.""'- Hits me right in the feels.*character limitClick here for the rest",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58613345-harry-potter-and-the-half-blood-prince,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.txt
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"Welcome to my re-read of the magical series “Harry Potter”. 🤓⚡️My journey this time around is a hybrid of reading the books, listening to a fun (adult) podcast and watching the movies. ❤️📚🎧🎬⚠️Spoiler Warning: stop reading now, if you’re unfamiliar with the world of Hogwarts.⚠️Personal Opinion Note: I’m terribly sad for you, if you’ve never read the books (or at least watched the movies). 😉📚🎧🎬I’ll be updating this review as I progress through the series, so, be prepared for a long review. 🤗📚Chapter 1: The Worst BirthdaysThe Dursley’s have not changed. They’re still terrible muggles. Harry has not heard from anyone all summer. Uncle Vernon’s boss is coming to dinner and Harry’s been told to stay upstairs and not make a sound.📚Chapter 2: Dobby’s WarningDobby the house elf really makes a bad first impression. Dobby had been taking all of Harry’s letters all summer, in hopes that Harry wouldn’t want to go back to school. Dobby does a spell and Harry gets the blame, soon after a letter arrives from the ministry of magic giving Harry a warning. Uncle Vernon puts bars on his window and says he can’t go back to Hogwarts.📚Chapter 3: The BurrowThe Weasley’s really are the best! Them showing up in a flying car to rescue Harry is the best scene ever. Harry tells them about Dobby. Fred and George tell him house elves usually belong to rich wizard families. Harry believes Malfoy sent him. Ron is embarrassed by his home, but Harry thinks it’s brilliant.📚Chapter 4: At Flourish and BlottsI love that Hagrid breaks up a fight between two grown wizards! Harry and the Weasley’s head to Diagon Alley to gather school supplies. Gilderoy Lockhart is signing books and announces that he’ll be the new defense against the dark arts teacher. Mr. Weasley gets into a rumble with Mr. Malfoy.📚Chapter 5: The Whomping WillowThat’s one mean tree!! Harry and Ron are unable to get through platform 9 3/4. So, they fly the car, along the train, to Hogwarts. But the crash the car into a very old and angry tree when they arrive. Ron breaks his wand.🎧Podcast: Binge Mode: Chapters 1-5***Warning: podcast has adult content***Ummm… did you read that warning? If you’re easily offended by things like: swears, wanking jokes, milf’s, etc. etc. do not listen to this podcast. To all my fellow heathens out there, this is not only entertaining- but also very spot on!📚Chapter 6: Gilderoy LockhartOooooo…. Weasley got a Howler!! Needless to say, Mrs. Weasley was none-to-pleased with the car disappearing from the station. Lockhart takes his moment to brag more, but only proves he has no idea what he’s doing. Ron’s wand is malfunctioning. Harry’s got a fan in a first year named Colin.📚Chapter 7: Mudbloods and MurmursPoor Ron can’t catch a break with that wand. He tried to curse Malfoy for calling Hermione “mudblood” and it backfired, resulting in him puking slugs. Speaking of Malfoy, his father bought his way onto the Slytherin Quidditch team. Harry hears a chilling voice.📚Chapter 8: The Deathday PartyHarry is nice to everyone, even ghosts. Nearly Headless Nick invites Harry to his deathday party. He foregoes the Halloween feast, to attend. Rotten food, cold room, screeching music… not exactly a warm blooded good time. While leaving the party, Harry heard the voice again. This time he follows it to find a message scrolled on a wall, about the chamber of secrets.📚Chapter 9: The Writing on the WallFilch’s cat got frozen, aka petrified. Professor Binn’s explains the history of the chamber of secrets, which supposedly contains a Slytherin monster that would wipe out all non-pure-blood wizards. The trio speculate that Malfoy may be the heir of Slytherin.📚Chapter 10: The Rogue BludgerFreaking Lockhart… such a dumb dumb!! First Quidditch game against Slytherin and a bludger is targeting Harry. He end up with a broken arm, which Lockhart tries to fish, resulting in the removal of Harry’s bones. As he sits in the hospital, Harry overhears the Colin was petrified as well.🎧Podcast: Binge Mode: Chapters 6-10***Warning: podcast has adult content***I love the why? why? why? We all think it and none of us know. It’s all very intriguing! Like Tom’s trophy still being displayed at Hogwarts… why?? Given who he is and what he’s done, you’d think that thing would be hidden or destroyed.📚Chapter 11: The Dueling ClubPolyjuice Potion in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. Hermione’s working on the potion. The whole school has heard about Colin. Lockhart starts dueling club, to keep everyone safe. Harry and Malfoy are matched up. Malfoy congers a snake and Harry speaks parseltongue in front of everyone. Another student and ghost are petrified.📚Chapter 12: The Polyjuice PotionHarry’s called to Dumbledore’s office, where he meets Fawkes the pheonix. The trio takes the polyjuice potion, Harry/Ron become Crabbe/Goyle, pointlessly, as they discovered nothing. Hermione became a cat.📚Chapter 13: The Very Secret DiaryHarry and Ron find a diary with TM Riddle on it. Ron remembers the name from a trophy. Harry discovers the diary writes back and allows him inside memories. He sees why Hagrid was expelled.📚Chapter 14: Cornelius FudgeHarry’s room was broken into and the diary stolen. Quidditch is cancelled and everyone is told the school is on lockdown. The Minister of Magic shows up to take Hagrid to Azkaban (wizard jail) and calls for Dumbledore to step down as head master.🎧Podcast: Binge Mode: Chapters 11-14***Warning: podcast has adult content***It’s really funny how they point out things, like Ginny being upset, so Fred and George scare her… Dumbledore asking Harry point blank if he has anything to tell him and he chooses not to. Truth. Hurts.📚Chapter 15: AragogPer Hagrid’s request, Harry and Ron follow spiders into the forest. They find Hagrid’s friend spider, Aragog, who is the size of a horse. The spider tells his family to eat them, but the old flying car rescued them in time.📚Chapter 16: The Chamber of SecretsGinny is still acting strange. The boys visit petrified Hermione, to find a note in her frozen hand, which identifies the monster as a type of snake. They run to tell, but overhear that Ginny was taken. They go into the pipes to find her.📚Chapter 17: The Heir of SlytherinHarry find Ginny in the chamber, with a ghostly Tom Riddle nearby. Tom shares about Ginny and his diary and his identity… Voldemort. Dumbledore’s bird Fawkes appears, carrying the sorting hat. Harry uses a sword from the hat, to kill the snake, gets bit, uses the snake fang to destroy the diary, causing Tom to disappear.📚Chapter 18: Dobby’s RewardHarry talks to Dumbledore about Voldemort. Mr. Malfoy shows up with Dobby on his heals. Harry confronts him about slipping Riddles diary to Ginny. He slips a sock into it and chucks it to Mr. Malfoy. He unknowingly freed Dobby. Lockhart and his wiped memory are no longer an issue. All the petrified get woken up. Gryffindor wins the house cup.🎧Podcast: Binge Mode: Chapters 15-18***Warning: podcast has adult content***They covered so much- but these last chapters covered a ton too! Main points: Why doesn’t Harry replace Ron’s wand for him? He has the money! But treats from the cart will have to do… lol…. Why does the school take so long to wake the petrified? Like those are the only Mandrakes in the world…. Dumbledore assures Harry he’s a true Gryffindor, because of his CHOICE to be in Gryffindor.🎬Movie #2I wish they had depicted the fist fight between Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Weasley in the movie. But alas, it was left out. But there was a lot still there, that I loved seeing come to life. Travel by floo powder…. the Mandrakes…. Harry going into the diary. I also love how Ron’s voice cracks all the time. It’s really great.🎧Podcast: Binge Mode: Movie***Warning: podcast has adult content***Hedwig!! Poor Hedwig. She does need a bigger cage and boy, oh boy, she had a rough time. Sadly the movie does skip quite a bit. Our choices define us, not our blood- what a great message overall. Hogwarts!! The safest place in the world, lol, where Voldemort has attacked Harry, twice now. I love that they manage to sum up all the thoughts with humor.Checking Chamber of Secrets off my list. Thanks for following along on my journey. Now… onto book 3! ❤️📚",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15881.Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.txt
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"(A) 86%| ExtraordinaryNotes:A tone transfiguration, it's so the boy-girl drama, bright to start, but breaks your heart, and ends in tears and trauma.*Check out progress updates for detailed commentary:Progress updates:03/15/2020- Preamble(1) I've said it before in comment replies, but I've always considered books 4-7 to be four parts of one very long book, which I call the ""Voldemort is Back Saga.""(2) Attending the Wizarding World Cup was mentioned at the end of ""Prisoner of Azkaban."" I think the only other tease of events to come was book six when HRH decided to leave Hogwarts.03/16/2020- 2%(1) The opening chapter is the first one not in Harry's POV. Another aspect that separates the latter books from the first three.(2) The village of Little Hangleton reminds me a lot of Pagford from ""The Casual Vacancy."" Both feature an abandoned manor house, for example. I wouldn't be surprised if the germ of that book started with this chapter.03/17/2020- 8%(1) Harry to Sirius: ""[Dudley] got really angry and chucked his PlayStation out of the window. That’s a sort of computer thing you can play games on.""- Historical inaccuracy. This takes place in 1994, the Playstation didn't come out until late 1995.(2) Last book, Hermione's letter mentioned Ron five times. Ron's letter here mentions her once :(03/18/2020- 10%(1) I think it's intentional, that right after Molly sort of intimidates Arthur into submission, Hermione does the same thing to Ron. It's juxtaposition!(2) I hear the name ""Ludo Bagman,"" and all I think of is ""Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong."" In my head he's Australian.(3) Wonder why Albania's such a hot wizard vacation destination?03/19/2020- 11%(1) Apparently, wizards don't use the metric system. Arthur needs Harry to help him pay the campsite manager in muggle money.(2) ""The Lovegoods"" are mentioned here. Probably Luna and her father – her mother having passed.(3) The only thing we know about Cedric, thus far, is he's handsome and athletic. Same as last book. Worth reminding, I guess.03/20/2020- 14%(1) In the book, Harry, Hermione and the Weasleys all cheer for Ireland. In the film, Harry and Ron support Bulgaria... I suppose so it doesn't look like they're all in Slytherin.(2) Crouch has a ""toothbrush mustache,"" also known as the Hitler mustache... or alternatively, the Charlie Chaplin mustache.(3) Crouch to Percy: ""Thank you, Weatherby.""03/21/2020- 16%(1) The Bulgarian mascots are veela... who can entrance men at will. Women aren't affected, which is an argument for having some female players... at least when playing Bulgaria.(2) ""'Let’s have a really loud hand for the gallant losers — Bulgaria!' Bagman shouted.""- ""Runners-up"" would have been more prudent, if only for political sensitivities.03/22/2020- 18%(1) Just like ""Weird!"" is Ron's catchphrase, ""Honestly!"" is Hermione's. She says it, for example, whenever Harry or Ron are entranced by veela. You'd think ""the brightest witch of her age"" would understand it's involuntary.(2) In the books, Hermione's always scared, while Ron's brave in the face of danger. In the films, it's the other way around.03/23/2020- 20%(1) Boy, after the World Cup, wizards be clamoring for portkeys like it's toilet paper at a Costco. Mass hysteria!(2) Harry says his scar hurt. Ron suggests they play quidditch to de-stress while Hermione insists he needs a nap. Ron and Hermione sort of have a fun parent/strict parent dynamic in this situation. Very much like Arthur and Molly do.03/24/2020- 22%(1) Harry's dress robe is brand new and bottle-green, while Ron's is shabby, lacy and second-hand. It's totally Ron's Cinderella moment!(2) Bill: ""[Rita Skeeter] called me ‘a long-haired pillock’.""Molly: ""Well, it is a bit long, dear ... If you’d just let me —""Bill: ""No, Mum.""- In the film all the Weasley boys and Harry have really long hair!03/25/2020- 24%(1) '""Hogwarts is hidden,"" said Hermione, in surprise. ""Everyone knows that ... well, everyone who’s read Hogwarts, A History, anyway.”""Just you, then,” said Ron. ""So go on.""'- Hermione citing ""Hogwarts, A History,"" expecting everyone's read it, and Ron saying she's the only one who ever has never gets old. It's my favorite recurring bit.03/26/2020- 26%(1) I just put together that ""Beauxbaton"" means ""beautiful wand"" in French. Mind blown! I don’t speak German so I can’t say if ""Durmstrang"" means anything. Though, knowing Rowling's penchant for stereotypes it's probably something downright Wagnerian: turmoil, fury and the like.(2) Apparently, Durmstrang offers courses in breakdancing. (see gif)03/27/2020- 27%(1) ""Squeezing the bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly satisfying. As each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowish-green liquid burst forth.""- Ironically, or fittingly, this is use to cure acne.(2) ""Professor Trelawney kept predicting Harry’s death, which he found extremely annoying.""- To be fair, he very often does nearly die.03/28/2020- 29%(1) Lavender: ""Oooh, which one’s that, Professor?""Trelawney: ""It is Uranus, my dear.""Ron: ""Can I have a look at Uranus too, Lavender?""- Ron will regret planting that seed.(2) Hagrid: “Yeh’ll do wha’ yer told or I’ll be takin’ a leaf outta Professor Moody’s book... I hear yeh made a good ferret, Malfoy.”- Sadly, Hagrid can't legally do magic.03/29/2020- 30%(1) Moody forcing Neville to witness the imperius curse is really cruel, knowing the backstory.(2) '""It’s all right, sonny,” [Moody] said to Neville. “Why don’t you come up to my office?... we can have a cup of tea..."" Neville looked even more frightened at the prospect of tea with Moody.'- Wonder how Moody prepares tea, and what china he uses.03/30/2020- 32%(1) ""Harry’s brain was as fogged as though it had been filled with the fumes from Professor Trelawney’s fire.""- As an alliteration aficionado, I approve.(2) '[Harry] just finished predicting his own death by decapitation. ""What’s in the box?"" he asked [Hermione], pointing at it.'- What's in the box? What's in the box!! (it's ""Se7en"" reference)03/31/2020- 33%(1) Hermione turns on ""Hogwarts, A History"" for not mentioning house elf abuse. Priceless!(2) '""You only like [Cedric] because he’s handsome,"" said Ron scathingly.“Excuse me, I don’t like people just because they’re handsome!” said Hermione indignantly.Ron gave a loud false cough, which sounded oddly like ""Lockhart!""'- Ron with the sick burn!04/01/2020- 34%(1) The Beauxbatons sit with the Ravenclaws and the Durmstrangs sit with the Slytherins. Thus foreshadowing that Hogwarts' champion will come from Hufflepuff or Gryffindor, or both.(2) Ron: ""What’s that?""Hermione: ""Bouillabaisse""Ron: ""Bless you.""Hermione: ""It’s French ... It’s very nice.""- Hermione, quickly after, stops liking French things.04/02/2020- 36%(1) Hagrid dresses for courting just the same as he does for court!(2) The Goblet of Fire is made of wood! Must be non-flammable wood.(3) ""[Crouch's] toothbrush mustache and severe parting looked very odd.""- Yes, uncomfortably odd. The mustache had me wondering, but the ""severe parting"" confirmed it. Crouch is intended to remind you of Hitler.04/03/2020- 38%(1) '""Madame Maxime!” said Fleur at once ... ""Zey are saying zat zis little boy is to compete also!"" Somewhere under Harry’s numb disbelief he felt a ripple of anger. Little boy?'- Well, Harry is somewhat shorter than average.(2) ""Did you put your name into the Goblet of Fire, Harry?” [Dumbledore] asked calmly.""- Yes, ""calmly."" See gif.04/04/2020- 40%(1) The Gryffindors throw a party to celebrate Harry (supposedly) cheating to get into the tournament. Celebrating deceit seems more like a Slytherin thing to me.(2) Stephen Fry uses the same voice for both Hermione and Professor McGonagall. I don't know if it shows a lack of range for female voices, or if he's actually making some subtle point.04/05/2020- 42%(1) Malfoy turns Hermione's front teeth the size of tusks. Ron, instead of immediately trying to fist-fight Malfoy, runs to comfort Hermione. That's character development!(2) Rita Skeeter forces Harry to squeeze into a dark broom closet with her for an interview. In my head I'm screaming, ""He's underage! That's the whole reason for the scandal!""04/06/2020- 44%(1) Last book it was Hermione who was on the outs with Harry and Ron, here it's the opposite. I appreciate the mirroring!(2) Rita Skeeter writes that Hermione's Harry's girlfriend... thus begins the boy-girl drama!(3) Hermione: ""[Krum]'s not even good-looking! ... [girls] only like him because he’s famous!""- She'll change her tune soon enough.04/07/2020- 46%(1) Hagrid shows Maxime, and by proxy Beauxbâtons, the secret first task simply to get her to like him. On one hand, it's helping the competition. On the other hand, everyone cheats anyway, and at least he gets the girl.(2) '""Never mind me, how are you?"" said Sirius seriously.'- It finally happened! Been waiting the last two books for that pun.04/08/2020- 48%(1) '""Hermione,"" Harry said, through gritted teeth, ""will you shut up for a bit, please?""'- Without Ron, I guess the job of reining in Hermione falls to Harry.(2) Moody: ""Cheating’s a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament and always has been.""- I knew it! Though knowing the twist at the end, I question how true this statement actually is.04/09/2020- 50%(1) '""Got a plan?"" said Bagman, lowering his voice conspiratorially. ""Because I don’t mind sharing a few pointers, if you’d like them, you know.""'- Bagman low-key offering to help Harry cheat sounds a lot like the start of a drug deal.(2) Rita Skeeter: ""I wonder if you could give me a quick word?""Harry: ""Yeah, you can have a word ... Goodbye.""04/10/2020- 52%(1) Viktor Krum persistently stalking Hermione in the library is at the same time endearing and creepy.(2) Shame the whole ""Blast-Ended Skrewts"" subplot was cut from the film. I would have liked to see what ""the most repulsive things Harry had ever seen"" looked like.(3) Apparently, one elf's servile emancipation is another elf's grievous shame.04/11/2020- 55%(1) ""Why do they have to move in packs?"" Harry asked Ron as a dozen or so girls walked past them .... ""How’re you supposed to get one on their own to ask them?""'- I've totally been there.(2) 'Ron was staring at Hermione as though suddenly seeing her in a whole new light.""Hermione ... you are a girl!""""Oh well spotted,"" she said acidly.'04/12/2020- 56%(1) ""Hermione — who are you going to the ball with?” said Ron. He kept springing this question on her, hoping to startle her into a response by asking it when she least expected it.""- In other words, ""Who's my new nemesis?""(2) Parvati: ""Padma’s going to meet you in the entrance hall.""Ron: ""Right ... Where’s Hermione?""- Wrong girl, Ron! Focus!04/13/2020- 57%(1) Dumbledore apparently found the Room of Requirement, filled with chamber pots, when he needed to urinate.(2) 'Hermione was now teaching Krum to say her name properly; he kept calling her ""Hermy-own.""""Her-my-oh-nee,"" she said slowly and clearly.""Herm-own-ninny.""""Close enough,"" she said.'- Before I knew better, I pronounced it ""Hermy-won.""04/14/2020- 58%(1) ""The Weird Sisters ... were all extremely hairy and dressed in black robes that had been artfully ripped and torn.""- Nice bit of historical accuracy there. 1994 was the very height of ""artfully ripped and torn"" clothes.(2) Ron insists Krum only asked Hermione to the Ball to get info on Harry. Jealousy aside, that's actually a legit concern.04/15/2020- 59%(1) Hermione: ""Next time there’s a ball, ask me before someone else does, and not as a last resort!""Ron: ""Well — that just proves — completely missed the point —""Narrator: ""[Harry] somehow thought that Hermione had gotten the point much better than Ron had.""- The saddest non-death scene of the series.- Hermione's tough, but so weak for Ron :(04/16/2020- 61%(1) Ron lays down some serious knowledge on giants. Filmmakers take note, Ron’s not dumb.(2) ""Ron and Hermione seemed to have reached an unspoken agreement not to discuss their argument. They were being quite friendly to each other, though oddly formal.""- Yes, classic ""drunk at the office X-mas party and overcompensating the next day"" behavior.04/17/2020- 63%(1) Don't know if it's been accentuated, but Harry looks downright tiny in the gif.(2) Harry: ""What d’you do, sneak up here in the evenings to watch the prefects take baths?""Myrtle: ""Sometimes, but I’ve never come out to speak to anyone before.""Harry: ""I’m honored. You keep your eyes shut!""- Moaning Myrtle... more like Pervy Myrtle, amiright?04/18/2020- 65%(1) Apparently, Myrtle being stuck in Hogwarts is sort of a jail sentence. The Ministry confined her there permanently for stalking Olive Hornby. So, technically she's a convict under a kind of house arrest.(2) Ironic how it's ""Moody"" who gives Harry the idea to pursue a career as an auror.

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"(A) 86%| ExtraordinaryNotes:An angsty apprehension, it's a tome of teacher torment, misbelief, new girlfriend grief, and dread no longer dormant.*Check out progress updates for detailed commentary:Progress updates:05/04/2020- Preamble(1) You can tell things have gotten dark from the title sequence. No longer shiny metal against still skies. Now it's rusty, pitted metal against billowing clouds.(2) Prior to my current re-read of the series, this was my favorite. Before that it was ""Half-Blood Prince."" Wonder if it'll keep its position or if I'll have a new favorite this time.05/05/2020- 4%(1) Harry: ""Why had Ron and Hermione got together without inviting him along, too?""- Oh, I can think of a few reasons...(2) Harry openly insulting his aunt and uncle and picking a fight with Dudley? This isn’t the Harry I know!(3) Super-angsty to start. ""No one understands me, no one tells me anything""... Someone’s been listening to Radiohead.05/06/2020- 6%(1) If you’re a wizard, don’t give your kids the initials AF, they’ll likely be a squib: Arabella Figg, Argus Filch.- Mrs. Figg's cat keeps tabs on Harry. Wonder if it's magic?(2) Petunia: ""I heard — that awful boy — telling her about [dementors] — years ago.""Harry: ""If you mean my mum and dad, why don’t you use their names?""- She means Snape.05/07/2020- 8%(1) ""Mundungus Fletcher"" is maybe Rowling's most expressive name, alluding to the words ""fungus,"" ""dung,"" and ""retch.""(2) Rowling loves adverbs. ""Stupidly"" is perhaps the most overused.(3) Lupin: ""And this is Nymphadora —""Tonks: ""Don’t call me Nymphadora ... It’s Tonks.""- She does take his name when they're wed. Can't be that insistent on it.05/08/2020- 9%(1) Tonks: ""Are you mad, Mad-Eye?""- Well, it's in the name. Though it could just be the eye that's mad.(2) House elf heads line the hallway of Sirius' place. Awfully macabre... though muggle taxidermy is common, so is placing urns on mantles.(3) Ron and Hermione spend the summer mostly alone in bedrooms together... wonder what they do all day?05/10/2020- 11%(1) Who knew Percy would be the Weasley black sheep?(2) Bill leaves Egypt for a desk job in London just to be close to Fleur. Some might call that romantic... others might call it stalking.(3) Molly: ""Who’s left all those Dungbombs outside the kitchen door?""Also Molly: ""Ginny, your hands are filthy, what have you been doing?""- I mean, put two and two together.05/11/2020- 12%(1) '""Arthur!"" said Mrs. Weasley, rounding on her husband. ""Arthur, back me up!""'- Is it really backing up a point if it's by coercion? and in front of everyone at that?(2) ""[Harry] had been touched by what [Mrs. Weasley] had said about his being as good as a son, but he was also impatient at her mollycoddling.""- Wonder if ""mollycoddling"" is why she's named Molly?05/12/2020- 14%(1) '""Size is no guarantee of power,"" said George. ""Look at Ginny.""""What d’you mean?"" said Harry.""You’ve never been on the receiving end of one of her Bat-Bogey Hexes, have you?""'- Married life will fix that.(2) ""Mrs. Weasley, Hermione, Ginny, Fred, and George ... [looked] rather peculiar, as they had tied cloths over their noses and mouths.""- Life imitates art.05/13/2020- 19%(1) ""Mrs. Weasley ... started fussing with [Harry's] T-shirt, tucking in the label and smoothing out creases across the shoulders. He wished she wouldn’t.""- Get used to having a mom.(2) The Ministry has jurisdiction over Britain and Ireland. Huh, must not have split when Ireland left the union.(3) ""a heavy locket that none of them could open.""- Hmmm, curious...05/14/2020- 20%(1) ""Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.""- In other words: Latin, Old-French, Anglo-Saxon, Irish, Old-English.(2) Molly: ""I don’t believe it! Oh, Ron, how wonderful! A prefect! That's everyone in the family!""George: ""What are Fred and I, next-door neighbors?""- Well, Harry was facing expulsion. Between Ron, Neville, Dean, and Seamus, Ron's the clear choice.05/15/2020- 22%(1) '""Mrs. Weasley had hung a scarlet banner ...Congratulations Ron and Hermione — New Prefects.""'- Cut out the ""New Prefects"" bit and you could reuse that banner.- It's always ""Ron and Hermione,"" like they're a music act or a comedy duo.(2) ""Harry’s mood suddenly lifted. His father had not been a prefect either.""- It nearly always boils down to daddy issues.05/16/2020- 23%(1) Considering the amount of time prefects spend together, it's no wonder so many end up as couples.(2) ""[Harry] would have liked Cho to discover him sitting with a group of very cool people ... he would not have chosen to be sitting with Neville and Loony Lovegood, clutching a toad and dripping in Stinksap.""- Ginny's also there, but Harry's as yet blind to her.05/17/2020- 24%(1) '""Tell me, how does it feel being second-best to Weasley, Potter?"" he asked.""Shut up, Malfoy,"" said Hermione sharply.'- More Ron/Hermione mirroring. Until now, it's always been Ron who's defended Hermione's honor against Malfoy's jibes. Here it's the other way around.(2) With Delores Umbridge, it'd be far more fitting for her initials to be FU instead of DU.05/18/2020- 25%One of these things is not like the other.(1) Students find it odd that Umbridge wears a pink cardigan. Not so much because it’s ugly, but mainly because it’s muggle attire. You know who else wears muggle clothes? Fudge. Umbridge is an insincere flatterer who does, or wears, anything to get to the top. A simple pink cardigan can say a lot about personality.05/19/2020- 27%(1) ""Harry was too used to [Ron and Hermione's] bickering to bother trying to reconcile them; he felt it was a better use of his time to eat his ... steak-and-kidney pie.""- Smart. He's got his priorities straight.(2) Harry: ""[Umbridge's speech] sounded like a load of waffle to me.""Hermione: ""There was some important stuff hidden in the waffle.""- Mmm... waffles.05/20/2020- 28%(1) Hermione hates Lavender because she's anti-Harry.- She'll hate her even more when she's pro-Ron.(2) Ron and Hermione as prefects are like an old married couple. Hermione even bosses Ron around like Molly does with Arthur.(3) ""Cho was almost always surrounded by a gang of giggling girls.""- That gang sounds terrifying!- I always hated Cho.05/21/2020- 30%(1) ""Poisonous toadstools don’t change their spots,"" said Ron sagely.- It's a much sharper metaphor than leopards.- Ron's all about wizarding common sense.(2) Umbridge sings her responses to student queries. Though, Mary Poppins she's not.(3) '""Have a biscuit, Potter.""""Have — what?""""Have a biscuit!"" [McGonagall] repeated impatiently.'- Take a biscuit, Harry!05/22/2020- 31%(1) Hermione: If you don’t stop doing it, I’m going to —""Fred: ""Put us in detention?""George: ""Make us write lines?""Hermione: ""No ... but I will write to your mother.""- Ouch! She sure knows how to twist the knife.(2) Hermione knits woolly hats and hides them under rubbish, hoping to trick house elves into freedom as they clean.- I mean, that's just unethical.05/23/2020- 34%(1) Angelina's not an ideal Quidditch captain. When she's stressed she gets bossy, when she can't get her way she gets stressed, and so on.(2) Ron spots Harry's scarred hand and implores him to tell McGonagall or Dumbledore.- Yet another Ron scene given to Hermione in the film.(3) Knitting things no one wants is yet another trait Hermione has in common with Molly.05/24/2020- 35%(1) Ron makes the Quidditch team by process of elimination. Two people fared better at keeper tryouts, but Angelina found one whiny and the other unreliable. Thank goodness for that!(2) ""[Harry] walked on, feeling quietly elated ... [Cho] did not hate him for being alive!""- Well, that's an awfully low bar. I'm fairly sure most people don't hate him for being alive.05/25/2020- 37%(1) O=Outstanding, E=Exceeds Expectations, A=Acceptable, P=Poor, D=Dreadful, T=Troll.- And people complain about my grading system...(2) Fred: ""Nothing wrong with a good, healthy P.""- I expect higher brow humor from the likes of Fred and George... puns are my thing.(3) Feel free to use my gifs. I post them on Imgur at:https://imgur.com/user/jaysongo/posts05/26/2020- 39%(1) '""But Sirius, this is taking an awful risk —"" Hermione began.""You sound like Molly,” said Sirius.'- Hermione/Molly comparisons continue.(2) Hermione: ""You know, I was just saying to Ron when you came in... we’ve got to do something about [Umbridge].""Ron: ""I suggested poison.""- Well, poison would certainly be effective.- Ron, always with the practical ideas.05/27/2020- 41%(1) Ron: ""You’re not still in contact with [Viktor], are you?""Hermione: ""So what if I am? ... I can have a pen pal if I —""Ron: ""He didn’t only want to be your pen pal.""- Ron knows what's up.(2) ""The barman ... [had] a great deal of long gray hair and beard. He was tall and thin and looked vaguely familiar to Harry.""- Hmm... who's tall and thin with a long beard?05/28/2020- 44%(1) Ginny starts dating Michael Corner, Ron hates Michael Corner... it's math.(2) Hermione: ""It says in Hogwarts, A History that the founders thought boys were less trustworthy than girls.""- On the whole, sure. Though a girl is the book's big turncoat.(3) Harry: ""Don’t worry, I’ll behave myself...""- Moments after founding a clandestine outlaw combat guild.05/29/2020- 47%(1) In the book, The Room of Requirement is Dobby's idea, in the film it's Neville's. Same with gillyweed in ""Goblet of Fire.""- Ergo, film Neville is book Dobby.(2) Hermione: ""I think we ought to elect a leader.""Cho: ""Harry’s leader.""Hermione: ""Yes, but I think we ought to vote on it properly ... It makes it formal.""- I don't know... the vote seems rigged to me.05/30/2020- 51%(1) '""Good luck, Ron,"" said Hermione, standing on tiptoe and kissing him on the cheek ... He touched the spot on his face where Hermione had kissed him, looking puzzled, as though he was not quite sure what had just happened.'- Ron had the same reaction with Fleur, except Hermione doesn't have veela powers.(2) ""Weasley is Our King"" is a hit song. Everyone sings it.05/31/2020- 52%(1) ""Hermione was going skiing with her parents, something that greatly amused Ron, who had never before heard of Muggles strapping narrow strips of wood to their feet to slide down mountains.""- My feeling exactly! But then, I'm from the tropics.(2) Dobby: ""HAVE A VERY HARRY CHRISTMAS!""- ""Harry"" as an adjective means to harass. So, I suppose I'll take it as a pun.06/01/2020- 54%(1) '""Mistletoe,"" said Luna dreamily, pointing ... over Harry’s head. He jumped out from under it. ""Good thinking ... It’s often infested with nargles.""'- I'd ship Harry and Luna.(2) Ron: ""What does she see in Krum?""Harry: ""I suppose he’s older, isn’t he ... and he’s an international Quidditch player.""Ron: ""Yeah, but apart from that.""- Ron's too obvious sometimes.06/02/2020- 58%(1) Harry: ""Are they doctors?""Ron: ""Doctors? ... Those Muggle nutters that cut people up?""- Ron's descriptions of the Muggle world never ceases to be a treat.(2) Arthur: ""I was just reading about Willy Widdershins’s arrest ... You know Willy turned out to be behind those regurgitating toilets last summer?""- Well, that's a loose end I never expected to be tied up.06/03/2020- 62%(1) Arthur: ""Well, I don’t know whether you know what — what stitches are?""Molly: ""It sounds as though you’ve been trying to sew your skin back together ... but even you, Arthur, wouldn’t be that stupid —""- I guess Ron takes after his mother.(2) ""Harry was sure he saw Neville slip the wrapper into his pocket.""- One of the most poignant lines in the entire series.06/04/2020- 63%(1) Hermione gets Harry and Ron homework planners for Christmas, which is kind of like gifting someone a diet book... it sends a message.(2) '""I want you to take this,"" [Sirius] said quietly, thrusting a badly wrapped package roughly the size of a paperback book into Harry’s hands.""What is it?"" Harry asked.'- It's Chekhov's Gun... uh, Chekhov's book-sized package.06/05/2020- 66%(1) Neville should have been the one to kill Bellatrix. Would have been justice for torturing his parents to insanity.(2) I figure with a name like Madame Puddifoot, your career options are rather limited. Either be the proprietor of a girly tea house or a shop for comfortable women's shoes.(3) Seems like Hermione withholds information from Ron just to see him beg.06/06/2020- 68%(1) '""Women!"" [Harry] muttered angrily.'- Well, that's what you get for dating your student.(2) ""Rita sat up straight again, her eyebrows raised, and drained her glass of firewhisky.""- Teatime's a bit early for firewhiskey.(3) Hermione: ""Harry, you’re worse than Ron... Well, no, you’re not.""- Ron, still champion of not being able to read girls' romantic signals.06/07/2020- 70%(1) Harry to Snape: ""Why do you call Voldemort the Dark Lord, I’ve only ever heard Death Eaters call him that.""- It's misdirection. Have the villains all do one thing and cast doubt on an ally by having him do the same.(2) Trelawny: ""You c-can’t sack me! I’ve b-been here sixteen years! H-Hogwarts is m-my h-home!""Umbridge: ""It was your home.""- Cold-hearted.*character limitClick here for the rest",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58613451-harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.txt
A Court of Thorns and Roses,"(Note from 4/17/2023 So someone reported this for unmarked spoilers even tho I prefaced it lol so the spoilers will be marked where they are, even though they really aren't spoilers at all because they do not significantly affect the plot in any way but oh well. It's either do this or have the entire review hidden bc of spoilers)(Note from 2/21/2023 because I apparently have to spell it out: For those of you who don't read comments or check dates read, I read and reviewed this book in 2018. It has been about 5 years; as I have stated in a number of comments, I will not continue this series. In the intervening years since reading this, my feelings on the matter have not changed nor have I desired to continue. Please refrain from commenting about how I need to continue the series or that I did not understand the book. I receive too many of those comments and I'm tired of replying the same thing over and over again. This review is for me first and foremost, not you. Please move on if you do not like my take.)Me to Sarah J Maas:""Do you lie awake at night to come up with all your witty replies for the following day?""Oh dear, this is awful.The WritingThe title of this book is stupid. It's stupid and flashy and unrelated to the actual content of the book. It's solely for the ~wow~ factor. The quotable line, ""I love you... Thorns and all"" is wholely ineffective because ""thorns"" had not been established as a motif and was only used in that context in that very scene, more than halfway through the book. The word ""thorn"" was only used a grand total of 9 times in this book. The original Beauty and the Beast story had established rose motifs—you can't borrow good writing, even for a retelling. That's just lazy.The writing itself was inconsistent and poorly done.I pushed and pulled, but the mud was too slick, and held fast.Are you aware of the definition of ""slick"", Sarah J Maas? I do not think it means what you think it means.Besides that, Amarantha's hair drastically changed color after about 90 pages:Her red-gold hairHer black hairWhich is it, Maas? It can't be both unless she has unmentioned magical hair dyeing abilities.The atmosphere and the opening chapter were excellent and I was intrigued by the idea that was offered me, but the actual book did not deliver at all.This next point is a spoiler, but because I am disgusted with Sarah J Maas for including this, I amnotgoing to mark it as such, since everyone should know what kind of morals this book is supporting before they read it especially when they are as filthy and vulgar as this was.The attemptedrapeof Feyre by Tamlin was brushed off as no more than a mere romantic, steamy encounter to further their lukewarm love story. The only conclusions I can logically draw from this are all rather victim blamey, tbh—she was warned several times to stay inside with the doors locked until dawn, but she leaves her room not once but twice before dawn because she ~wants to go to the party~ and then later, after she almost gets gang-raped and is saved and then creeped out by Rhysand the sociopath, she thinks she is totally safe to go eat a bunch of cookies because, well the drums stopped, so it's probably okay now, and then she getssexually assaultedby Tamlin, who wasstill high with lust magic.I was about to pass out when he grabbed me, so fast I didn't see anything until he had me pinned against the wall.""Let go,"" I said as evenly as I could.I [pushed] him away. He grabbed my hands again and bit my neck. I cried out as his teeth clamped onto the tender spot where my neck met my shoulder. I couldn't move—I couldn't think.Before, during and after theattack, she's thinking,Wow, he's really hot. I'm kinda uncomfortable with this, but I guess it's okay that he's drunk on lust magic, because I wanted to sleep with him anyway. That is avery wrong and dangerous way of thinking.No matter what, it isneverokay foranyoneto make someone else sexually uncomfortable or afraid, especially when they've given verbal disapproval. This entire scene left a bad taste in my mouth.And then there's Rhysand's behavior. He repeatedly violates her personal space and comfort, drugging her and forcing her to""dance""for him in front of a large crowd for weeks on end after stripping her all but naked. Like all Fae males, apparently, he uses brute force to get her to comply with his sexual wishes.""But he didn't actually touch her; he kept his hands just on her waist!"" you say. Yeah, but did she say he could touch her at all? Did she actively encourage him to touch her? No, she did not.I pulled away, but his hands were like shackles.I would not have such an issue with this if Sarah J Maas didn't give the impression that she supports such behavior. That is what I find unconscionable.Besides that, the plot made no sense, even after exposition-Alis gave us the lowdown—in fact, it almost madelesssense then. It was cheesy and cliché and frankly, boring. The ""riddle"" was extremely easy and only proved that Feyre is an absolute idiot with no logical abilities, as I was able to figure it out before Amarantha had even finished saying it, and I'm notoriously bad at riddles.The sex scenes were almost Empire of Storms levels of bad, cringey, and gross. I think Sarah J Maas doesn't know what YA means and isn't aware she's actually writing for NA.The WorldbuildingThe Fae were, for one thing, almost exactly the same (primarily in appearance and personality) to the ones in the Throne of Glass series, and tbh I was disappointed. They're not even cleverly unique faeries. They're just Tolkien-esque elves that are actually vampires: fangs and biting, immortality, aetherial beauty, animalistic tendencies, superiority complex. They don't have any distinct differences from humans in their thought processes or emotional capacities—only the same degree of variety that exists in humans.The religious system and creation story was very interesting and I really liked that aspect.The CharactersFaerie aka Belle: Sarah J Maas decided to try something new and have a first-person fixed perspective, but it didn't really work, because Feyre was a bland complacent character without much substance passed the surface level, and most of the interesting action took place where she couldn't see it. She suffered, like Celaena did in Crown of Midnight, from what I call Nehemia syndrome: the character that the MC has grown to trust, despite obvious suspicious behavior, turns out to be manipulative, and yet the MC completely overlooks that fact in favor of idolization of their lying friend. In this case, everyone in Prythian is keeping secrets from her and after almost getting her questions answered by the Suriel, Feyre decides to ""Stay with the High Lord. He will keep you safe,"" and just completely forgets that she wants answers about the blight. Also, whereas Belle left the Beast in the original story because her father was in mortal danger, in this book, Feyre leaves becauseTamlin impies that she's gonna get ganked by Rhys or Amarantha, the evil Faerie Queen.She is not an active protagonist. Also, her painting skills aren't a part of her characterization; it just feels tacked on to make her ~cool~ and ~unique~Tampon aka the Beast: I don't even care about this guy tbh. He's a confusing character who just feels like a Chaol-Rowan merge on steroids. He's violent, obsessive, and abusive, but also sweet, understanding, and caring, because that's not a contradiction. There's a difference between a complex character and a poorly written character.Lucien aka Lumiere/Cogsworth (his steampunk eye suggests Cogsworth but his personality suggests Lumiere): So apparently he ""hates"" Feyre even though I almost shipped them more since they consistently had better chemistry than her and Tammy, and that's saying a lot, because they didn't have chemistry.exposition-Alis aka Mrs Potts: She was okay. Just okay. She was fine.Reese's Cups aka also the Beast and kinda Gaston too: Is he supposed to be her love interest for the rest of the series or something, because the fan art definitely suggests that, but, uh, did everyone forget that he's a dangeroussociopathwith a history of violence?? He has no regard for her emotional well-being and sees her body as literally nothing beyond a sexual plaything. He's a horrible person.Amarantha: Why did there have to be a ""big bad evil Faerie Queen"" in this at all? There's already one in the Throne of Glass series and I can only take so much female-against-female hate from a supposedly feminist fantasy writer. Amarantha was bland and predictable, and her motivations were extremely surface-level.Her fam: Nesta was like, supposed to have some kind of implied character arc but lol it wasn't very good. Elain was nice and I liked her. The dad was okay, I guess. Pretty forgettable tbhIsaac Hale aka fake-out Gaston: This character wasn't important at all, but I just wanted to say that I think this is the dumbest name choice in a high fantasy book that I've ever seen.Isaac Hale?? Really, Sarah J Maas? Really? That's the Jason of fantasy names. This is a the-guy-who-went-to-high-school-with-my-older-sister kind of name. It's not a fantasy name.ConclusionWhile I managed to read it fairly quickly, I had to dnf it for several days before deciding to trudge through. It was horrendous. I may pick up the sequel at some point, idk, but for now, from what I predict and understand from various spoilers I've encountered on the internet, I don't really care about this series very much. Frankly, it's not good.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50659467-a-court-of-thorns-and-roses,A Court of Thorns and Roses.txt
Caraval,"*record scratch**freeze frame*Yup, that’s me. Scarlett Dragna, main character of the YA hit Caraval. You’re probably wondering how I ended up in this situation. If everysinglethingthathappenedinthiswholebook was anything to go by, it was through a combination of pointless lying, constant embarrassment, obsession with Some Guy, a big act of caring about a younger sister despite very little indication of that being true, unrelenting drama about a dumb wedding, repetitive interactions, weird descriptions, gender-based generalizations, and insanely personal info-dumps about emotional happenings from the past.(insert elegant bow here) And that, my dear friends, is my Scarlett Dragna impression. Thank you. Yes, thank you. Oh, please, stop with the standing ovation! I’m just like all of you. Except I possess such bitterness and have such a grasp of the future that I wrote a character description at the 25% mark, and god did it hold up.Yup. You guessed it. I didn’t like my most anticipated book of the year.https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...(What a surprise!you probably all chant in unison.)I almost felt guilty about writing a negative review about this book - because it’s about to be damn negative - but then I remembered it’s THIS BOOK’S FAULT. It marketed its damn self as a young adultThe Night Circus. It must take some serious goddamn gonads to look at a masterpiece, essentially magic with a front and back cover, and go, “Yeah. My book is just like that.” Spoiler alert: it’s really, really not.Oh, God, this review is going to be long. My bullet point list of notes alone is long. And I am putting away fruit snacks like nobody’s business, so I’ve got enough sugar in my system to sustain a lengthy burst of anger. Strap in, everybody! (Note from later: I sugar-crashed when I was almost done this review. But it did last me through most of it.)THE SETTINGAll I want is a good setting. All those times I said I just want a good characterto love and settle down with, I think - and relish this rare gift of a moment - I think I was wrong. I think I care most about settings. (Hence why books with magnificent settings get five star ratings no matter what.) And thus, it is my curse to eternally pick up every book that is compared to The Night Circus.This book does not have a good setting. It’s confusing: everything that seems solid is gone back on later. Nothing is real. That doesn’t lead to a good setting. But I’ll talk more about the constant, piece of sh*t cop-outs later in this review. It lacks the strong descriptions that a setting literally needs. It doesn’t feel magical at all. (More on that later, too.) But above all, it’s not goddamn GROUNDED.Haha. That GIF made me feel a little better. Thank you, my favorite person of all time forever, Bo Burnham. Anyway, as I was saying. This. Is. Not. Grounded. In Round 14 of 3947234829 why The Night Circus is better than this book and the latter should never have been compared, TNC takes place inour world. Yeah. The author (presumably) realized 1) maybe we need a little bit of magic! And 2) she couldn’t create one of the greatest settings of all time while also establishing a fantasy world. It would have weakened the whole book.But Stephanie Garber did NOT make the same choice. Instead, we’re unceremoniously dumped into a world where there are islands and colonizing empires and that CLASSIC YA trope of using clunky terms to differentiate the world from the real one (like Hot Season, because they don’t have WORDS FOR THE SEASONS). Even more fun, during this book characters travel between countries/colonies/islands/empires/I have no idea, and the reader has NO GODDAMN CLUE WHAT IS GOING ON.Alright, I think I’ve talked about the setting for too long. I see that now. But this is an UNFORGIVABLE OFFENSE, OK?THE CHARACTERSWe’re introduced to a world’s worth of characters here, and this book achieves quite a feat - they all manage to be either flat, boring, or both! Yaaaaay! I’m totally ready to try to pretend to feel emotionally connected to these goons for 400 pages!!First: Scarlett. Cannot believe we were trapped inside the head of the most boring character of all time throughout what was supposed to be a suspenseful thrill ride! (But, obviously, was not.) She’s easily embarrassed, obsessed with propriety, falls in pretty much instalove with Julian because he’s hot. Lies all the time because poor widdle gal is embarrassed of something or other about herself. Super weak. Constantly questioning her own reasoning and letting others make decisions for her. Tries to act like she’s a protective older sister, but, speaking as a protective older sister, she doesn’t give much of a sh*t about family when she’s staring into Julian’s eyes or literally sucking his fingers.But then we get into a whole different type of characters: Those who, by the end, we know NOTHING. ABOUT. Tella, Julian, Legend. We’re given descriptions of them that are gone back on, returned to, and gone back on again. Nothing is real. The whole thing is confusing and an absolute waste of energy. I came SO GODDAMN CLOSE to DNFing this book because it has about 100 twists andnone of them make sense.I wanted to shake myself out of a nightmare. What the hell was going on for 400 pages?!Beyond that, they’re boring and I don’t want to talk about them. And so were the “villains.” Scarlett and Tella’s dad is literally ruthless for no reason. His wife left him and now he plays psychological games of abuse with his daughters. There’s a moment where he essentially tries to get his daughter’s fiancé to rape her. And for what reason? It makes no sense. No sense at all. He slaps a random girl across the face at one point, murders some random dude. I don’t know what excuse to make for that except that this book is sloppy.THE PLOTWord to the wise...if you haven’t read this book, you may want to skip this section. Even the stuff I don’t mark as spoilers may be somewhat spoilery. I’ll try, kind of.So this book centers on Caraval, the supposedly wonderful setting I’ve already moped about for way too long. Caraval attracts a bunch - well, an unknown number of people, and is supposed to be a scavenger-hunt-style game. Somehow, though, in spite of the bajillion people who actually give a sh*t competing against her, Scarlett juststumblesinto the goddamn clues.Here’s my world famous (I’ve become famous since the beginning of this review, right?) Scarlett impression, coming back to show you what following her through this shindig feels like. “Oh, this terrible poem-slash-cheat sheet I was unceremoniously given says I have to ‘earn’ the next clue! It’s probably just this thing I randomly picked up along my travels with zero fanfare! Or maybe it has something to do with a situation I just stumbled into! Doesn’t matter which choice I make, somehow it’ll be manipulated into being the right one!” Where are the stakes?!I also feel like 80% of this is just us listening to boring old Scarlett being like, “Omg, I think Julian is lying to me. Whatever shall I do?! I don’t trust him!!! I just want to kiss his face off!!!” Etc, etc. And despite spending ALL OF HER TIME with him, she’s never just like:And when Scarlett’s piece of shit dad shows up with her fiancé to like, punch her in the stomach until she says she’ll make babies or whatever, she and luhhhhhhverboy have the DUMBEST REACTION. They get caught in a poor widdle thunderstorm, stop to make out for somewhere between 90 minutes and 7 hours, and get caught by the Dynamic Duo of Bad Characters…despite being about 1 f*cking yard away from an entrance to a hidden tunnel system.An entrance they knew about all along! I wish they both died.Also: two deaths, neither real, both anticlimactic and annoying. Not. A. Fan. That’s literally just a ploy to make it seem like your dumb book has the emotional depth it strives for. WHICH IT ABSOLUTELY DOESN’T.And this book is just one cop out after another. Weird choice to write a supposed ““““high fantasy”””” book without wanting to define your world at all! Everything that is said definitively is gone back on, so many conflicting descriptions of Caraval are given that I couldn’t summarize them if I tried, and on top of all that, we don’t even get answers at the Big Reveal.LANGUAGEThis book is written...weirdly. For one thing, Scarlett, in order to remind us of her special snowflake status, sees emotion in COLOR. It is straight up so annoying. Here are a handful of my least favorite instances, for your readinghorrorenjoyment.1. “She could see the sting of her rejection in shades of stormy blue, ghosting over his heart like sad morning mist.""2. “Periwinkle curiosity” (I don’t know why I hate that one so much. I just really do.)3. “It would have been a mistake to kiss him, yet she felt … disappointed. It came in cool shades of forget-me-not blue, which wrapped around her like evening fog, making her feel hidden enough to acknowledge that she wanted to experience more of Caraval’s pleasures than she would ever have admitted out loud.”Did you notice anything besides how irritating that quirk is? Numbers 1 and 3 are pretty much the DAMN SAME. What the hell?!The language in this book isn’t always AWFUL, it’s just...weird. Every sentence is very overwrought. Like, not everything has to have figurative language. Here’s my favorite example: The worst poem I have ever, ever read is in this book. And I’m an English major who hates poetry. Would you like to read it?""This girl was last seen with Legend.If you catch her, you shall catch him as well.Of course, you may have to venture through Hell.But if you succeed you may find yourself rich.This year’s winner will be granted one wish.""I do have to give this book some props, because this is the first time I have ever had to shut a book for 90 seconds in order to hysterically laugh. No one ever told me that the word “rich” rhymes with “wish”! Hahahaha. This poem should be used to teach the importance of using meter.GENERAL STUPIDITYI haven’t had the absolute privilege of writing one of these sections in a while! It’s like a homecoming. An unpleasant, unwanted homecoming. Like if my home was a festering swamp, or a city sewer system.Here’s one beautiful example - seriously, it’s like a gift from the reviewing gods: “Then she did her best to explain the truth about death and Caraval. Tella didn’t know the particulars as to how it worked. It was one of those things that people didn’t really talk about.” See what I mean?! Instead of the author coming up with an actual defined magic system, she just says “Oh, um...well the character doesn’t know. There’s that!” The world has no definition and neither does the magic. In other words, some of the sloppiest fantasy I’ve ever had the privilege to read.Plus, there’s a lot of weird stuff going on with hooking up with your family members’ sloppy seconds. I don’t want to talk about it because I’m grossed the f*ck out. I just want to let everyone know I’m SUPER not a fan.There’s also a fun moment where Scarlett lectures her sister on how “You can’t be in love with someone you just met,” even though a) she fell in luuurve with Julian in less than 5 days and b) she was planning on marrying someone she’d never met, and thought she could tell he was a good guy THROUGH LETTERS. So dumb.And then maybe my favorite moment of all: When a fortune teller tells Scarlett she wants “love and protection,” her reaction is even worse than I would have expected from a character I hate. She says, “Isn’t that what every girl wants?” WHAT. THE. DAMN. HELL. No! No, not every girl, you piece of shit! It’s fine to want that, but some girls want adventure and knowledge and friendship and bravery and the ability to look out for their damn selves! What the actual f*ck?!Bottom line: I can’t believe how much I hated this book. (Or how long this review is.) Boring setting, boring characters, boring plot. Overall confusing language and decisions and reveals. I honestly wish I had never read this book.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27883214-caraval,Caraval.txt
City of Bones,"19 Apr '16Bet you're sick of my updates, now.Just for reference, on the recent Sherrilyn Kenyon v Cassandra Clare.Kenyon hasfiled a lawsuitagainst Clare, and also provides alist of alleged similaritiesbetween Clare's work to her own.Read and decide for yourself.15 Jun '13update again!Saw some stills for the movie, and to be honest, despite being slightly spurious in my ""casting"" ofCity of Bones, I actually think my version is much better than the movie version.I mean, look at Isabelle, and look at Clary.Correct me if I'm wrong, but Isabelle is supposed to bewayhotter than Clary.And don't even get me started on Jace.I mean, Jamie Campbell Bower was cute in a couple of his other films, but.... Jace was supposed to be..... I dunno... swoon-on-your-feet-panty-wettinghawwwt.And Simon.....I mean, he has ""friendzone"" written all over him.12 Jan '13I know this is now being made into a film, and Iknowthey've all got the cast sorted out, but I imagined them very differently. So here's how they all played out in my head:Simon - Aaron Taylor-JohnsonFor some reason, I always imagined Simon as young Eisenheim. And a part of me wants to kick myself for associating the 2006 film with this book in any way.Alec - Ezra MillerAnd no, it'snotbecause he's queer.Isabelle - Jessica SzohrBecause I wanted to put this picture in here, 'kay?Jace - Draco MalfoyI mean come on. Is there even a debate on this??Clary - Kristen StewartOnly because her acting skills match the quality of Clary's personality.11 Aug '12Also known asWhy Readers CAN Review An Author As Well As His/Her Book, And Why STGRB Are Full of Shit And Obviously Never Took English Lit Classes For Telling Us We're Not Allowed To.I heard aboutthe whole plagiarism issuelong before I even heard ofCassandra Clare's books, so I tried getting into it as objective as possible, given the circumstances. All I know is that she pretty much copy-pasted whole wads of text from another FF writer, from published books, from TV dialogue - into herDraco Dormienstrilogy, without providing any credit to the original authors.I also know that she lifted wads of text fromDraco Dormiensinto her publishedMortal Instruments. What remains a mystery, though, is whetherthesebits copied intoThe Mortal Instrumentswere her own original pieces of writing, or some of them even plagiarized work?I won't go much into the whole plagiarism thing, since if indeed any plagiarized work exists inThe Mortal Instruments, that is pretty much speculation.However, it does bring to mind questions of ethic;should a plagiarist be published?Some people strongly believe in giving second chances. I think people only deserve second chances when theyadmitto their errors and have truly proven their repentance. Both cases which I have not as of yet heardCassandra Claredo.Other questions popping into my head includeshouldn't there be some sort of punishment for plagiarists?!I mean, if I did in university whatCassandra Claredid inDraco Dormiens(and, arguably,The Mortal Instruments), then I would've been kicked out on the curb and my pretty Master's degree ripped to shreds. And, similar to the wholeChris Browndebacle, instead of condemning her far below ethical work habits, we, the consumers, commend their ""artwork"", as if sending the message that whatever wrongs they have done, it doesn't matter because people still eat their shit up. There is no learning curve here; or at least, no deterrence factor.But anyway, I tried to suppress these nagging questions while I read the book, because I wanted to know if I would truly,objectively, enjoyCity of Bones. Especially after the whole ""GR Bullies"" absurdity, where an increasing number of voices proclaim thatReviews Should Be About Books And Completely Separate From The Author.Well, ladies and gentlemen, my experience readingCity of Boneswill provide evidence (alongside many other ample evidence out there), that no -sometimeswe, as readers, cannot keep the two things separate.Sometimes, our moral and ethic code just won't let us. Reading is, after all, a subjective experience, andall sorts of thingsinfluence our enjoyment of it, including our perception of the author. And if that affects our enjoyment of a book, then it damn welldoesbelong in a review if we choose to put it there.So. Anyway. Now that I'm off my soapbox. The biggest thing that stands out while I readCity of Boneswashow inconsistent the writing was. It was so lazy and repetitive, information was handed over to us on a silver platter - there was no subtlety or any depth going on. But then there would be brief, short scenes or dialogues thatactually made me laugh out. Those few and interspersed scenes surprised me, like one wet and icky autumn day, when I found a five dollar bill while raking up my neighbour's filthy garden.Try as I might to ignore it, I was at a dilemma.Should I enjoy this?I mean, it's only five dollars. Surely they couldn't miss it. And, I mean, I'm working myarseoff in this horrible weather because mymotherowes them a lawnmower. And anyway, it might not evenbetheirs to begin with.In the end, I took the money (come on, you would've, too!), but I just didn't enjoy it as much as I would have. And thedelightI should have felt atfinding moneyjust wasn't there.These funny bits of dialogues and scenes filled me with just as much inner turmoil as my five-dollar-note dilemma, and even though Iknowthat maybe, perhaps, it could be that these are allCassandra Clare's own words, I still couldn't shake off the icky suspicions out off my gut - did she ""draw inspiration"" from some other unknown source, here?In the end, it just ravaged me with too much guilt and suspicions that what originally would have been a five-star scene was reduced down to three stars and a really, really sad face.Also a part of the inconsistent writing, was theinconsistent narration. I know 3rd person omniscient gives the narrator the power to sift through characters' thoughts and emotions as they please, but this is what made the narrative sound forced and contrived. We would normally follow Clary as the novel progresses - until it is convenient for us to see things from another character's perspective, in which case off we'll jump into another person's head.Theseconveniencesare justoneexample of what I mean when I say thatthe narrative lacked subtlety. When we aren't directly being fed a certain character's thoughts and emotions through his/her own point of view, we are blatantlytoldtheir feelings by the character themselves. Rarely are people in real life so honest andself-awareas the characters inCity of Bones.""An asshat?"" Jace looked as if he were about to laugh.""What you said to Simon--""""I was trying to save him some pain. Isabelle will cut out his heart and walk all over it in high-heeled boots. That's what she does to boys like that.""*""(...) You want to know what it's like when your parents are good church-going folk and you happen to be born with the devil's mark?"" He pointed at his eyes, fingers splayed. ""When your father flinches at the sight of you and your mother hangs herself in the barn, driven mad by what she's done? When I was ten, my father tried to drown me in the creek. I lashed out at him with everything I had--burned him with everything I had--burned him where he stood. (...)""*""I didn't think you liked me all that much.""Isabelle's brightness faded and she looked down at her silvery toes. ""I didn't think I did either,"" she admitted. ""But when I went to look for and Jace, and you were gone..."" Her voice trailed off, ""I wasn't just worried about him, I was worried about you, too. There's something so ... reassuring about you. And Jace is so much better when you're around.""The point I'm trying to make, here, is that we get to know the characters becauseother characters are constantly telling us about them, instead of us making our own informed opinions of them based on their actions and words. This is why I saythe writing was lazy and lacked depth. And howCassandra Claretried to show us that her characters have background and troubles and areoh such damaged goodswas more or less through self-testimonials such as the second quote up above, where Magnus Bane so conveniently gave away his entire childhood to three random teenagers. The chapterThe Werewolf's Talewas another one of these self-testimonials for another partially-important character.This is a whole new level of telling-instead-of-showing.Where unimaginative writers just unload all these information through descriptive prose,Cassandra Clarewas at least creative enough to hide it into her dialogue. But the same underlying problem is still there - weseenone of this ""damaged goods"". I didn't needSweeney Toddto tell me his past to know that he was a damaged, troubled man. Hisactionsspoke it for me.As forinformation being handed to us on a silver platter-- all you need to do is take a look at the entire ending scene with Valentine to see my point. The whole chapter was an infodump session. Rarely do I read villains who are so eager to reveal their past and provide explanations to their potential victims. TheHarry Potternovels were slightly guilty of this - especially in the earlier books - but I believe a lot of other things about the books redeemed itself from this one fault.Jace was also a bit of an infodumper, but I don't take away points for this. I mean, I get it - it's hard to get on withoutonecharacter at least explaining what the blazes was going on.Speaking ofcharacters... this is rather tough.Many reviewers despised Jace because he was such an asshole.Clary herself accuses Jace of being an asshole plenty of times. But I've lived a fair amount of years, and I was friendly with quite a few assholes during my own teenage years. And let me tell you one thing: Jace is no asshole. He's a guy with daddy issues, trying to act tough. Andthatis as deep as any of the characters get. I guess, he would be my favourite character out of the whole lot - notmy favourite characteras in the one I liked the most, but the character whom, in my opinion, was the most developed, withoutself-testimonialsorother characterstelling us about him.But remember my five-dollar-note dilemma? Yeah. Jace was, without a doubt, a direct cut-and-paste of theDracofromClare'sDraco Dormienstrilogy - who, by default, is a creation ofJK Rowling's. So forgive me if I""can't separate the book from the author""because frankly? If I enjoyed this book simply because of Jace, that doesn't say much about the rest of the book, or the quality of writing, because Jace is not evenClare's original character.Further illustrating theinconsistenciesofClare's writing, though, was thesudden and drastic change in Jace's characterduring the scene with Valentine. There is no way one person, in such a short amount of time, could thoroughly convince and change Jace into such an ... obedient? passive? receptive? character. No matterwhothe person claimed he was, orwhatevidence he brings to the table. Even if Jace believed in everything Valentine told him, there isno wayit would have drastically changed him in such a manner and such a short time.Just as unlikely, was the way Jace was ready to walk the ends of the world with Valentine, build a new life with him, and in the next moment - after a few words from Clary - was ready to throw that all away once again.Thedouble inconsistenciesastound me.Claresimply does not understand human psychology or even humannatureenough to make solid characters.The other characters were forgettable,to say the least. They all sounded the same, I'm afraid. Witty, dry sort of humour. It gets tiring after a while. Also, the Magnus-and-Alec thing? Can I just say,ew? Magnus is like, what? Forty? And Alec is ... sixteen?Even Valentine the Villain was ...not much of a villain.He didn't frighten me, or evendauntme. I kept reading how Clary was disgusted at howmanipulativehe was during his scenes, but reading the pages myself, reading his words, his actions? He wasn't particular conniving or ingenious - really, it was just that Jace was so ready to have a family back, he was willing to lap up every bit of contradicting information he heard.Plot progression and twists were unsurprising.Uninspired. No, wait, theywereinspired. ByStar WarsandHarry Potter, to name a few. Perhaps even a bit ofBuffyin there.And this is where my final dilemma lies.To like, or not to like? That is the question.For light fluff, it has entertainment value enough. Butwhat little entertainment value therewas, was lifted off other, better, pieces of workout there. To say that I did not enjoyCity of Boneswould be a lie; but the question is, did I enjoyCity of Bones, or did I enjoy the bits ofHarry PotterandStar WarsinCity of Bones?I'll let you decide if it's fine to like a book filled with other writers' characters, other authors' plot twists, other screenwriters' dialogue. Perhaps I'm being too uptight, but here's how I see it. New York with Potterverse and Star Wars. Take that away and what are you?",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/256683.City_of_Bones,City of Bones.txt
Once Upon a Broken Heart,"To put it simply,Once Upon a Broken Heartis a hot mess. The premise promises a fairytale, but what Garber delivers is a confused nightmare. With an annoyingly-naïve protagonist, a one-dimensional cast of supporting characters and a truly “what the fuck”-inducing plot, this book’s only saving graces are the short chapters and fast pacing, which at times can too be a hindrance to your enjoyment and desire to rate this book higher than you actually will.The beginning chapters of this book are the only thing that delivers on the premise. With vivid imagery, they instantly drew me in and I could see the improvement in Garber’s writing from the six (boring) chapters I had read ofCaraval. (As you can guess, that didn’t last very long).Once Upon a Broken Heartfollows rose gold-haired Evangeline Fox, whose stepsister is set to marry Luc, her one true love. Believing Luc to be cursed and desperate to stop the wedding, she enlists the help of Jacks, a Fate and the Prince of Hearts. He agrees to do so under the condition that Evangeline will kiss 3 people of his choosing, but doesn’t say any more than that. Willing to do whatever it takes to stop Luc marrying Marisol, she agrees to the deal but the wedding is stopped by Jacks turning everyone to stone. It is here that Evangeline first displays her wishy-washy personality, as she regrets her actions and drinks the poison that turned the bride, groom and wedding guests to stone – thereby taking their place.Evangeline, as a protagonist and narrator, frustrated me endlessly. She’sinsanelynaïve, always trusting people she shouldn’t and wanting to help Marisol (her stepsister) when it’svery obviousthat a) her sister is shady and up to no good and b) she generally has no reason to. The two of them have next to no relationship, but because Evangeline is so Wonderful and Perfect and Special Because She Has Pink Hair, of course she has to want to help. She’s also a very passive character: things happentoher, notbecauseof her. Now, I know what you’re probably thinking: “Characters are allowed to be naïve! It’s part of their growth!” or “Characters are allowed to be nice! They don’t all have to be sword-wielding assassins or (insert other character trope here)”. Trust me, I hear you, but there’s a difference betweenthose charactersand Evangeline Fox.The side characters – yes, including Jacks – in this book are no better. They’re all one-dimensional and flat, having one ‘unique’ aspect about them… and that’s it. I could tell you hardly anything about them. Jacks’ past with Donatella is briefly mentioned, but I wouldn’t really class that as him having personality, and I think it’s more fanservice for existingCaravalfans than anything.I can separate this book into two parts: Before Evangeline Drinks the Poison and After Evangeline Drinks the Poison. I enjoyed the Before part, as After Evangeline Drinks the Poison is where Stephanie Garber seems to have forgotten the novel she promised to readers, and began writing something else entirely. Ergo, the plot had gone haywire.The book’s plot follows no clear structure; it’s all over the place. Sure, there’s a little bit of “action” but that does nothing to redeem a story that is 99% Boring and 1% Interesting Scenes. There were numerous attempts at romantic scenes throughout the book, but Evangeline has no real chemistry with either of her potential love interests (one of them is literally cursed to be in love with her, so there’s that), so it did nothing for me and I skim-read most of them.Once Upon a Broken Hearttook an extremely bizarre turn after the introduction of vampires. Yes, you read that correctly. Vampires. What the fuck are vampires doing in this book? It was so completely and utterly random, I was honestly thinking ‘what was Stephanie Garber on when she wrote this?’ while reading. We were given no real explanation as to why vampires were included either. It was like a complete abuse of authorial power on Garber’s part: she thought vampires were cool, soshe just put them in the book, with no real thought as to the sense (or lack thereof) it would make. And trust me, it madezero sense. Unfortunately, around the last third of the book and its “plot” hinges on vampires, so there wasn’t any escaping them.There was also a prophecy subplot, becauseof course there was. The prophecy in this book centres around the Valory Arch, a mysterious archway in The North which contains either treasure and secrets or deadly monsters (no one is really sure which). Evangeline, having such Main Character Energy, is the key to unlocking this arch/doorway (I get she literally IS the main character, but just roll with the punches here). I say it’s a subplot, but I honestly couldn’t tell you what was the main plot and what were subplots in this book. Garber weaved a lot of threads throughoutOnce Upon a Broken Heart, and they got tangled up at times.As a ‘minor’ complaint, a lot is told to readers and not shown. For instance, after Evangeline has just woken up from being poisoned, she is told of a Week of Terrors that unfolded after the cancelled wedding, but we’re not given any information about it. Later, through dialogue, Evangeline learns of information she needs to know to progress the plot, but it’s done in quite a heavy-handed manner. There’sa lotof it, and wasn’t done subtlety or in small pieces, like you might see elsewhere in other novels.To give myself something positive to say about this book, I did like its short chapters and relatively fast pacing. As a slow reader, I appreciated being able to get through this book super quickly. Yes, that’s all I have to say. Moving on!The book ends on a cliffhanger. It’s somewhat intriguing, but I certainly won’t be reading the sequel. If for whatever reason, after reading this review, you’re still inclined to readOnce Upon a Broken Heart, you might want to hold off on doing so until the sequel is out, as this will leave you with too many loose plot threads and unanswered questions – more than any book should.Thank you to Kate Keehan and Hodder & Stoughton for the eARC!↠ 1 starBookstagram✦BookTwitter✦BookTok15/04/2024: I'm far too late in adding this, but if you're looking for a YA fantasy series (with enemies to lovers, morally grey characters, and corruption arcs) that will actually be worth your time, may I direct your attention toThe Kinder Poisonby Natalie Mae!",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55987278-once-upon-a-broken-heart,Once Upon a Broken Heart.txt

Serpent & Dove,"Rating: 1.5 StarsBefore I begin I'd like to start us off with some quotes:""Didn’t all men share some sort of unspoken camaraderie? A mutual understanding of their own collective importance?""""From the dawn of time, this has been men’s plight – to be tempted by women."" - Mean Witch-hunter #47Does this dialogue make you go haha yeah #feminism, or does it make you cringe in a little ball? Well you're in for this type of writing and much more!Serpent and Dove has been marketed as a clash between witch and witch-hunter, the revolutionary new fantasy romance novel. What you actually get is 90% romance with poor world-building and very little witch/witch-hunting action. I can totally understand if you just want a guilty pleasure book that has a hate-to-love (and by love I mean forever and always and eternal and our souls are bound as one) romance, but if you are expecting anything more you will be disappointed.Since I opened this review with some quotes, let me explain my issues with them and with the style of writing in general.1) Nuance? Never heard of her.If you're looking for any sort of nuance in this book you can check your expectations at the door because you won't find it here. There are many heavy-handed quotes that prevent any real insight or examination into the characters or society as a whole. You might hope that the author would use the premise of two people with drastically different philosophies on life to explore why people get indoctrinated into cult-like groups and how people might struggle with their faith when faced with atrocities but ..... nope.2) AnachronismsNow you could argue that anachronism isn't something that even applies to fantasy novels.These phrases didn't exist in historically accurate magical witch colonies!isn't a strong argument in-and-of itself. But Lou's diction sounds like you took an edgy modern teenager and dropped her into this story. The author is clearly using a backdrop that resembles France anywhere from the 14th century to the 18th century, and includes the patriarchal and religious baggage that comes with such an era. The reader is supposed to believe that Lou was raised in such a society, but her dialogue is so dissonant with the world she resides in that it is very difficult to get any sense of realism. It's one of the reasons the world-building is so poor: the characters (especially Lou) and the society are completely at odds. I don't expect the characters to speak with historically accurate phrases, but the dialogue is so uncompromisingly modern that I wouldn't have been surprised if she started using hashtags. Which leads me to...3) #WokeNow look, obviously I'm all for strong feminist characters; it's one of the main selling points for YA fiction. But I dislike the use of heavy-handed crowd-pleasing quotes that proclaim a feminist message in place of well-crafted characters and stories that show this message. Good stories don't need to tell you that they're progressive. Often books that use #woke quotes actually contradict their message with poor characters which is what happens here! But more on that later.Now I have one more more thing to say about the writing style. In addition to cringey quotes there are also just badly worded sentences.""Our respect had once been mutual. But that was before the envy.""""There were worse kinds of smoke than chimney.""There were worse kinds of smoke than chimney.There were worse kinds of smoke than chimney.How did anyone think that this is good sentence structure??? It's clunky, awkward, and just plain uncomfortable to read. I think any English teacher would underline this in a heartbeat with a note that just said syntax! Honestly this would make my top 10 worst literary quotes of 2019 if I had such a list. Perhaps I should make such a list.Let's move onto the plot. Like I said before there is very little witch action. It will trick you at the beginning into thinking there will be a lot of interesting magic, but that doesn't last long. The majority of the time you will be quite literally stuck in a room with our protagonists. There is some interesting action at the end, but the poor world-building means the reader never feels that this conflict has much weight. The only world-building you get is from a few info-dumps sprinkled throughout the book and you barely get to see this magical world integrated into the setting or the plot. And for some reason they edited the Goodreads book description so that it now spoils most of the plot points that hold any interest? Why would you do this? I have screenshots! The previous description was much better, but I digress. So let's take a look at main subject of this book: romance.If sappy romance is all that you're looking for I'm sure you will be fairly satisfied. But I would warn other readers that these two people go from hating each other to this:""I loved him. Deeply. Such a love was not something of just the heart and mind. It wasn’t something to be felt and eventually forgotten, to be touched without it in return touching you. No . . . this love was something else. Something irrevocable. It was something of the soul.""in the span of this short novel. Yes, it is that overly-dramatic and it doesn't follow any realistic progression. Firstly, Reid doesn't undergo any type of character arc in which he learns to accepts witches. Of course for the majority of the novel Reid doesn't know that Lou is a witch, but he is aware that she sympathizes with them. So there should have been some type of progression/self-doubt but it is barely explored! Minor spoiler: in the SECOND HALF of the novel Reid captures and burns a witch alive.... and he feels nothing! There is no internal conflict about morality; not even a hint of self-doubt. He only feels bad that Lou is upset but at no point in the novel does he ever explore his feelings about this event, and I'll remind you that he is a viewpoint character. He just burns someone alive ..... and then we move on. The author never takes advantage of situations like these to further the growth of a character. A character can't go from burning a witch to fulling loving one in the last half of a novel! They could have saved this full acceptance for a future novel because in the context of Reid's character arc - or lack thereof - it falls flat.Secondly, many aspects of the romance contradict the self-proclaimed feminist message. Lou seems to enjoy that Reid acts possessive/jealous once they are married even though she doesn't like him. As Lou's feelings grow she refers to his ex-love interest Celie as a ""cow"" multiple times though she knows nothing about her - I thought we were past this as a society. Lastly and most importantly (Minor Spoiler) when Lou discovers Reid is still a virgin even though he had a relationship with Celie she has this thought:""How could Celie have abandoned him in this? What else was first love good for but bumbling hands and breathless discovery? At least she’d taught him to kiss properly. I supposed I should be grateful for that.""Just let that sink in. I could write a dissertation on the problems with that statement. Stay tuned for my 100-page essay! But let me at least say this to any young girl who is reading this review:You have absolutely no obligation or responsibility to be physically intimate with your significant other. It is a very personal decision that should be made in your own time and if anyone ever tries to manipulate you into doing something you are not ready for, drop them! You deserve better. It is your choice and don't ever feel any sort of obligation to do more than you feel comfortable doing.This quote sends such a dangerous, toxic message in a novel aimed at teenagers that it honestly disgusts me. Not to mention that in this era any girl would have been socially ostracized if not physically abused had she become pregnant while she was unmarried so Celie's actions are even more understandable (do you see what I mean about the disconnect between character and society?). And this is why I have so many problems with the #woke language of this novel since its underlying sexist tones completely undercut its feminist message.In conclusion, I feel that this novel has many problems. It doesn't deliver on world-building or fantasy adventure, and the romance is over-dramatic and at times problematic. I'm not here to criticize anyone who found enjoyment in this novel, but I hope I have made potential readers aware of type of book they will be reading. It may seem that I am holding YA literature to an overly high standard but it is only because I have a lot of respect for the genre and I know that many great books have and will continue to grow from it. This is not one of them.Thanks to Edelweiss for the ARC.Review of Blood & Honey",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40024139-serpent-dove,Serpent & Dove.txt

Red Queen,"It’s getting a little hot in here, isn’t it? That’s because Red Queen has unearthed what I never thought could occur: AminiDarkling. That’s right. Yet another morally ambiguous character and I am sold.I’m a book pusher and I’m going to push this one right into your hearts.Red Queenis the fantasy that I’ve been searching for. You’ve probably all heard the comparisons before and honestly, they speak the truth.Red Queentook the best elements from all our favourites (and our not so much) tales and smushed them into one phenomenal book with an equally addictive storyline. Yes, this is indeed an Xmen high fantasy and yes, my heart did stop. Aveyard has ticked all the right boxes for me. She’s a heck of a debut.Red Queenbegins as all high fantasy dystopias do, with ayoung unassuming girl slumming her way through her rather unfortunate situation only to discover that she’s special.Yes, that does sound mildly sarcastic. Yes, this did have the“You’re special”line. But you know what? I’ve come to a point in my life where I’ve realised, do YA fantasies do it any other way? It feels like a genre requirement at this stage and who am I to complain when a hundred and one others do the exact same thing. Mare Barrow is a highly agile pickpocket. It’s the only means with which she can support her family. But time is running out. Like her brothers, she sees a future of conscription for herself. Her eighteenth birthday is looming and without a job to pardon her, she is set to enter the frontline. And it scares her. The thought of war, the thought of leaving her sweet, innocent sister behind, the thought of waving goodbye to her parents, yet another member of the family unable to support them. However as life may have it, her seventeen years of familiar suffering are about to take a different turn. As in, she’ll suffer, just at different means. You see,Mare is discovered to be an impossibility, the secret that could topple an already precarious hierarchy.Society is ruled by the silvers. They are a race seemingly set apart by God. They themselves have usurped the title. As abnormalities defying the mundane genetic makeup, they are creatures to be feared. You can go either two ways with that—to the ditches or raised up on a throne. The Silvers are blessed with the latter.They are Gods in the arena of life.“Long ago he called us ants, Red ants burning in the light of a Silver sun. Destroyed by the greatness of others, losing the battle for our right to exist because we are not special. We did not evolve like them, with powers and strengths beyond our limited imaginations.”Their inhuman capacity to bend the elements has crafted an illusion of invincibility.Reds however bleed red. They are mortals, cursed to a life of servitude.“…no one pays attention to another Red servant, another insect wandering past the feet of gods.”And a society without equality? It’s a dangerous tower, begging to topple over.As a Red with a Silver aptitude, Mare is dropped into a dangerous game. It is a political desire that keeps her alive. While her days are limited to however long she can keep in line, Mare is given a route out of the slums, away from her fate of war. In a bid to placate the hunger for a rebellion, she becomes a Red in disguise as a Silver, betrothed to the King’s second son. From there on out, it is a game of chess.""A puppet. A show to keep people happy, quiet, and trampled.”Alliances must be won and bought. Secrets come at a cost.What I adored aboutRed Queenis the concept. It was delectable. The abilities reminiscent of XMEN add a unique flavour to the mix. The world building was neither underwhelming, nor overwhelming. Aveyard interweaves all facts and ideas into her intricate world in a fluid manner. We also see elements of The Selection added to the bag, onlywithout the pettiness.We enter Aveyard’s world just as Crown Prince Cal is set to be engaged. The Queenstrial is set in place as a selection process. Only, instead of vying for the Princes attention, it is a little more of a family affair. These Silver women all hail from families equivalent to dukes and duchesses. It’s a bloodbath, not between the ladies, but between the families. And they’re all out to impress one person: the king. You see, it’s all a ploy, for the Queenstrial is merely a selection process for political ties. The marriage is a means to an end, an cementation of an alliance. And in that arena there is only one thing that prevails: strength. Power and strength are two concepts that could happily marry one another, and in Red Queen, they certainly do.The action sequences were incredible. Red Queen digs a little deeper,exploring political themes, alliances and the ultimate consequence of repressing a race.“This world is Silver, but it is also fray. There is no black and white.”It, like all dystopias, tells the tale of a fight for liberation. Humanity does not wish to be oppressed. It craves expression. And the structures that have carefully restricted the Reds, barricading them into one route in life, threatens to crumble with the dawn of every new day.“You believe you are the masters of the world but your reign as kings and gods is at an end.”Unlike other dystopias, we deal with life at court inRed Queen. And in that instance, there is a heavy influence of political ploys, deceit and games. It is a battlefield and it is the explicit who fall first. The shadows, those who play their cards, are the ones who ultimately have the upper hand.“I’m the shadow and no one remembers shadows.”Red Queensets a question for the new dawn: Can those who cheat one another overlook perfidy in order to band together against an ultimate enemy who has betrayed them all?For a debut novel, Aveyard writes stunningly. While she does not hold the outright lyrical styles of the likes of Bardugo and Stiefvater,she writes with a balanced combination of short, concise simplicity with an ounce of lyricism every now and again.It is a prose that will be likened by many. Often with high fantasy tales, humour can be disregarded, however I appreciated thatAveyard knows a little thing about sarcasm and banterand she incorporates it brilliantly.“You want me to pin my entire operation, the entire revolution, on some teenaged love story? I can’t believe in this.”I’m going to hug Aveyard.I love the dig she took at the conventional dystopia.My little heart is swelling with pride, considering this is a topic I tackled in a critical essay of mine (which I also refer to as my baby. You know, casually.) I enjoyed a good laugh here and there.The characterisation was fantastic.We have a set of characters that are tenuous in their beliefs but deep down they are flawed.Tragically, deeply and realistically. Mare Barrow reeks of desperation. She’s in it to survive. She knows the stakes and I appreciated her character growth as she realises that there is a greater cause at hand. Cal, the crown prince, lives under the delusion of hierarchy. It is a precarious structure that he is set to rule and he understands the pros and cons—it is easier to maintain dictatorship then it is to liberate. And he attempts to seek the easier route. Maven, my little puppy, lingers in the backdrop, the second son to a kingdom that will never be his. He is demure, quiet but he is steadfast in his belief. Despite his apprehensiveness towards Mare, he finds himself intrigued by her. And he’s just a little sweetheart.But I know that you’re all here to hear about the romance. I get you. We all know that there’s going to be one. And there is. One that I ship so incredibly hard. In fact, I may even ship the politically incorrect side because god knows I have a thing for sociopathic characters. They feed my curiosity. I’m intrigued by the unknown.“He knows what he is and, worst of all, he likes it.”Humbleness and good intentions do not faze me.Some may say that this is a love triangle. I’m going to go right ahead and say that itmay not even be a romance, at this stage.If anything, Red Queen is playing down a dangerous path, one reminiscent of Bardugo’s infamous Grisha series. That’s right, I said it:We have a Darkling. You know how I feel about that. Of course I’d gravitate towards this book. That being said, this book reeks of betrayal. Love thrives off trust, connection, understanding. What brews inRed Queenisdark, delicious and destructive.Neither party will foster a healthy relationship.Now I don’t want to speak too soon, considering I did an incredibly silly thing by reading this in 2014, butRed Queenhas got to be my favourite fantasy set for 2015 thus far. That’s a bold statement to make, considering we haven’t even entered the year yet. I am however willing to take that risk. You see,Red Queenjust explores a winning formula for me. We are at thebrink of a revolution funded by the desire for revenge.It isjustifying darkness in hope of pursuing lightness, liberation and levelling the amount of pungent injustice.And that isbegging to fail.And I want to see that unfold.Many thanks to the publisher for providing an advanced copy in exchange for an honest review. All quotes used were obtained from uncorrected proof that is subject to change in the final publication.___________________Two words:New Darkling. Read at own risk. Something's coming. Like my full review.In the mean time, I'll be quick and vague. This isXmen put in a cake mix withShadow and BoneandThe Selection(DON'T BE PUT OFF. I mean this in that we have a Selection BUT it is not a petty, shallow, fickle show of swinging back and forth. DO NOT EVEN COMPARE IT TO THAT.)We have a protagonist we longs to survive, a crumbling hierarchy, a delusional view of justice and peace and a war of strength and power. The stakes are high.It is what appears to be a love triangle but honestly, it's not that in any sense. These characters are destructive, they are flawed, they shan't have a happily ever after. And they've cracked my heart in half, to be honest. I'm drowning in my emotions here.Go preorder or something. This is beautiful. I'm book pushing this for 2015, alright?",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22328546-red-queen,Red Queen.txt
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"(A) 85%| ExtraordinaryNotes:A flavorful foreboding, it plies expanded bandwidth, like ripened fruit, and more acute: a sweet and spicy sandwich.*Check out progress updates for detailed commentary:Progress updates:02/13/2020- PreambleOf all the books, most people say this one's their favorite. I believe a big reason why is it hits the sweet-spot between the middle-grade fare of the first two and the dark seriousness of the last four. On the whole, I enjoyed the last four more, as serial installments of the ""Voldemort is back"" storyline. But of the standalone books, I like this best.02/14/2020- 4%(1) Hedwig flew all the way to France, assuming Hermione would have a gift for Harry. A bit presumptuous.(2) Hermione's letter: ""Dear Harry, Ron wrote to me ... Did you see that picture of Ron and his family ... Ron says he's going to be in London ... Ron says Percy's Head Boy ... Ron doesn't seem too happy.""- Ron, Ron, Ron. It's all about Ron.02/15/2020- 7%(1) ""Ron Weasley ... came from a whole family of wizards. This meant that he knew a lot of things Harry didn't, but had never used a telephone before.""- Filmmakers should've taken note... not so much the telephone part.(2) Everyone's weirdly casual about the fact that Harry's punished with beatings. Likely entirely acceptable in the early '90s.02/16/2020- 12%(1) ""Muggles have been told that Black is carrying a gun (a kind of metal wand that Muggles use to kill each other).""- Well, wizards use wooden wands to kill each other too.(2) Fudge took off his pinstriped cloak and tossed it aside, then hitched up the trousers of his bottle-green suit.""- Trousers? Suit? Fudge enjoys muggle clothes, I see.02/17/2020- 15%(1) Hermione takes Muggle Studies. Which, while not cheating, is a lot like taking a language you're fluent in.(2) '[Hermione's] arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat.""You bought that monster?"" said Ron, his mouth hanging open.""He's gorgeous, isn't he?"" said Hermione, glowing.'- Well, Hermione does have a thing for gingers.02/18/2020- 18%(1) When arguing about Harry's safety, it's Arthur who insists on extra precautions, while Molly believes Dumbledore knows what's best. I'd have thought it'd be opposite.(2) ""Mrs. Weasley kissed all her children, then Hermione, and finally Harry.""- I wonder if Molly ever treated her kids' other friends this way. Possibly, she's seen the future.02/19/2020- 27%(1) ""Crabbe and Goyle seemed to exist to do Malfoy's bidding.""- That's quite the meta statement.(2) '[Professor Trelawney] shot suddenly at Parvati Patil, ""beware a red-haired man."" Parvati gave a startled look at Ron, who was right behind her and edged her chair away from him.'- Hmm, it'd be a much better omen for Padma, Ron’s Yule Ball date.02/20/2020- 30%(1) Pansy Parkinson is totally Malfoy's Lavender Brown. Unlike Ron, Malfoy's content to string her along.(2) Malfoy calls Buckbeak ugly, provoking an attack. Wonder if hippogriffs understand English or are just sensitive to tone.(3) Ron's surprisingly proficient at potions, at least where knifework is concerned. His roots are ""beautifully cut.""02/21/2020- 34%(1) Parvati's greatest fear is mummies. I'd assume they'd only be a real threat in Egypt. Though, perhaps she was menaced by one brought over for Victorian unwrapping parties.(2) Lupin and the Marauders mocked Snape as students. Lupin encourages Neville to mock Snape in effigy. Snape bullies Neville more than ever. Not right, but it makes sense.02/22/2020- 37%(1) Crookshanks kills a spider, and eats it in front of Ron. Then goes to kill Scabbers: taking out all Ron's natural enemies.(2) ""Ron and Hermione had just turned up in the common room, pink-faced from the cold wind and looking as though they'd had the time of their lives.""- See, who said Ron and Hermione can't get along, just the two of them?02/23/2020- 41%(1) The Hufflepuff quidditch team's secret weapon is Cedric Diggory... who makes all the female Griffindor players giggle and swoon.(2) Snape calls Hermione an ""insufferable know-it-all."" Ron yells at Snape and gets detention... only Ron gets to call her that ;)(3) Snape makes Lupin's class study werewolves... because he's such a troll.02/24/2020- 45%(1) Lupin: ""Don't worry. I'll speak to Professor Snape. You don't have to do the [werewolf] essay.""""Oh no,"" said Hermione, looking very disappointed. ""I've already finished it!""- This is why I procrastinate.(2) Trips to Hogsmede essentially serve as bonding-time for Ron and Hermione. Or at the very least, a ceasefire during their pet conflict.02/25/2020- 49%(1) Ron has a crush on Madame Rosmerta, which the book only hints at. In the film Hermione teases him about it.(2) In the book Harry finds Ron and Hermione in Honeydukes. In the film they're by themselves in a secluded wood:Hermione: ""Do you want to move a bit closer?""Ron: ""Huh?""Hermione: ""To the Shrieking Shack.""Ron: ""Oh no. I'm fine here.""02/26/2020- 55%(1) For someone who scolds others for breaking rules, Hermione's awful cavalier about entering the boys' dormitory.(2) '""When thirteen dine together, the first to rise will be the first to die!""... Professor McGonagall poked a large spoon into the nearest tureen.""Tripe, Sibyll?""Professor Trelawney ignored her.'- McGonagall with the sly diss!02/27/2020- 58%(1) I'd imagine butterbeer must taste something like a cross between butterscotch and root beer.(2) Dementors drain happiness. The remedy for a dementor attack is chocolate. Ergo, chocolate equals happiness.(3) Hermione's favorite subject is arithmancy. I'd never have taken her for a numbers person. But then, math is the opposite of divination.02/28/2020- 62%(1) Cho is to Harry as Cedric is to the Gryffindor girls. Eyes on the snitch, Harry! Not the girl!(2) Harry is to the Firebolt as Jon Snow is to Longclaw.(3) '""Penelope and I have got a bet on,"" [Percy] told the team. ""Ten Galleons on the outcome of the match!""- Yes, because making your girlfriend pay you money is always a good idea. *eye-roll02/29/2020- 64%(1) Hermione: ""Harry, if you go into Hogsmeade again... I'll tell Professor McGonagall about [the Marauder's] map!""- Oh, Hermione. Always resorting to blackmail. Like getting Harry's broom confiscated worked so well.(2) Hagrid: ""Really upset, [Hermione] was, when Black nearly stabbed yeh, Ron.""- Never confide in Hagrid, he always spills beans!03/01/2020- 66%(1) Ron to invisible Harry: '""Where are you? ... Are you still there? This feels weird!""'- ""Weird"" seems to be Ron's catchphrase, as in ""Weird! What a shape! This is money?"" or “So that’s a house-elf? ... Weird things, aren’t they?”(2) ""Harry tried to look innocent, all too aware of his sweaty face and his muddy hands.""- Blame it on herbology!03/02/2020- 68%(1) '""Oh, Ron!"" Hermione flung her arms around Ron's neck and broke down completely. Ron, looking quite terrified, patted her very awkwardly on the top of the head. Finally, Hermione drew away.'- Ron's not used to being hugged, I guess. Pats go on the back.(2) Ron totally gets turned on by Hermione punching Malfoy. She should've done it sooner!03/03/2020- 70%(1) Hermione quits divination... which fulfills the prophesy of the lost pupil!(2) Trelawney: ""Would anyone like me to help them interpret the shadowy portents within their Orb?""Ron: ""I don't need help ... There's going to be loads of fog tonight.""(3) For a supposed charlatan, Trelawney's remarkably accurate with her omens... albeit imprecise.03/04/2020- 73%(1) Co-ed changing rooms seem like a recipe for disaster.(2) Penalty shots in quidditch are never adequately explained or described. Is it soccer-style, where the shot's taken from a fixed position? Or is it hockey-style, where the player moves toward the goalkeeper?(3) Apparently, wizarding trials involve a judge, jury,andexecutioner.03/05/2020- 75%(1) Apparently, Ron has giant feet. Could well call him Ronald McDonald instead of Ronald Weasley.(2) Like Neville, Hermione's boggart is also a teacher. It's McGonagall saying she's failed everything. Unlike Neville, she fails to find the humor in it.(3) Hermione blushes when Ron compliments her rule-breaking. Weird what passes for sweet-talk.03/06/2020- 77%(1) I'm getting a definite ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" vibe at the scene where the Grim pulls Ron below ground.(2) At the execution scene, both Harry and Hermione fall to pieces. Surprisingly, it's Ron that's the pillar of strength.(3) The tunnel at the base of the Whomping Willow goes off the Marauder's Map. It's literally uncharted territory.03/07/2020- 79%(1) ""'If you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us too!' [Ron] said fiercely, though the effort of standing upright was draining him of still more color, and he swayed slightly as he spoke.""- Another estimable Ron line/act given to Hermione in the film.(2) Knowing how the book plays out takes all the edge out of seeing Sirius as a villain.03/08/2020- 82%(1) Lupin seeing Peter on the Marauder's Map is a spit-take I want to see!(2) Hermione's awfully naive, assuming every Animagi voluntarily registers with the Ministry. But then, she's new to rule-breaking.(3) I heard J.K. Rowling say once that being a werewolf was akin to living with AIDS. Really makes you read Lupin's origin story differently.03/09/2020- 87%(1) ""Bandages spun up Ron's leg, strapping it tightly to a splint. Lupin helped him to his feet; Ron put his weight gingerly on the leg and didn't wince.""- Far cry from the film, where Ron's a whimpering wreck.

A ​Court of Silver Flames,"”Your power is a song, and one I’ve waited a very, very long time to hear, Nesta”.Aviso: la primera parte de esta reseña va a estar libre despoilersy les diré cuando empiecen a aparecer para que puedan dejar de leerla si no quieren saber qué pasa.No sé por qué me sigo sorprendiendo de que Sarah J. Maas lo logre una y otra vez. Es absolutamente impresionante lo que esta mujer puede llegar a transmitir con sus palabras. De verdad, leyendo ACOSF sentí que me destrozaban hasta lo más hondo y que luego, poco a poco, me iban reconstruyendo y poniendo cada pieza en su lugar.Como muchos aquí, debo confesar que no estaba tan emocionada por este libro porque se centraría en Nesta. Pero, así mismo, tengo que admitir que me comí todas y cada una de mis reservas y que, leyendo cada página, entendí profundamente a Nesta, sus traumas, su sufrimiento, su personalidad, la culpa que siente todo el tiempo y la sensación de que nunca eres lo suficientemente bueno para nadie. Y no sólo la entendí, sino que me sentí jodidamente identificada. Y, claro, luego me di cuenta de que odiaba tantísimo a Nesta porque reflejaba las partes más horribles de mí misma.ACOSF es un libro tremendamente intenso y lleno de emociones, de momentos de confrontar los sentimientos más oscuros, de arrepentimientos, rabia y odio. Pero también es una historia que lleva a Nesta en un camino que le permite enfrentar todos los demonios que tiene por dentro, todas las cosas que se ha guardado durante años, las decisiones que le quitaron de las manos y su odio hacia sí misma. Y, a pesar de lo oscuro que es el pozo en el que está y de lo duro que es el camino, Nesta se va a dar cuenta de que siempre va a existir alguien al otro lado de esa oscuridad para tenderle una mano, para caminar junto a ella y para recordarle una y otra vez que sí que se merece el amor de sus amigos y de su familia. Que nunca va a estar sola.En serio, no les puedo decir con palabras lo hondo que me llegó esta historia al corazón. Sí, es el libro máshotde Sarah J. Maas y todas esas escenas están diseñadas para ser leídas mientras estás en una tina llena de hielo porque… joder. Y obviamente las marqué todas y casi me da un infarto leyendo otras. Y también mucha envidia. Pero más allá de eso, creo que eran una forma súper poderosa de comunicar lo mucho que Nesta necesitaba una distracción, salirse de sus pensamientos durante unos momentos… u horas (because Fae lovers, jajaja) porque estar dentro de su cabeza era demasiado doloroso. Y la entiendo.Y Cassian… ay, ¿cómo puede existir alguien tan bueno, valiente, sensible y paciente? Si amaron a Cassian en los libros anteriores, en este van a querer abrazarlo (y más cosas, ejem) hasta que todo esté bien para él. No se pueden imaginar todo lo que conocemos sobre Cassian en ACOSF, sobre su pasado, sus sentimientos, sus miedos y, sobre todo, cómo es tan genuino como para siempre demostrar lo mucho que le importan quienes son cercanos para él, todo lo que estaría dispuesto a hacer y soportar por ellos. En este libro, Cassian enfrenta toda la tormenta de proporciones épicas que significa estar cerca de Nesta, pero lo hace porque sabe que ella está en un lugar oscuro, que está luchando por salir de allí y él la entiende… porque ha estado él mismo en ese camino antes. Joder, es que, de verdad… después de leer este tipo de cosas, ves a las personas del mundo real y te das cuenta de que eso no existe. Ojalá todos pudiéramos tener la certeza de que, cuando salgamos de nuestros momentos más oscuros, siempre va a estar alguien allí esperándonos para decirnos que todo va a estar bien o incluso sólo para sonreírnos o abrazarnos.Ahora, obviamente todo el libro no se centra únicamente en Nesta y Cassian, sino que Sarah J. Maas nos presenta una nueva amenaza que puede, nuevamente, destruir todas las Cortes e incluso afectar al mundo de los humanos. Pero esta es una amenaza mucho más antigua, poderosa y letal de lo que el Rey de Hybern pudo llegar a ser. Más adelante hablaré de ello, pero me gustó que hubiera una historia paralela de conflicto, de magia arcana y de monstruos que no pueden volver a caminar libremente por el mundo.Antes de empezar con la sección despoilers, tengo que decirles que amé profundamente volver a ver a los personajes que adoro. Feyre, Rhysand, Mor, Amren y Azriel no son solamente sombras en el fondo de las escenas de ACOSF, sino que siguen siendo importantes y están allí para los momentos más críticos. Ahora, que ellos sean ligeramente menos importantes en este libro que Cassian y Nesta no quiere decir que Sarah J. Maas no los vaya a usar para rompernos el corazón, triturar los pedacitos, sumergirlos en ácido y luego incinerarlos. De verdad, es tremendo… Y lo único que diré, y que discutiré más a fondo más adelante, es que les juro que no pude parar de llorar con el último 10% del libro. Y no precisamente de felicidad.Vamos con losspoilersy con Isa perdiendo la cabeza… de nuevo.•••1. Sí, vamos a hablar de la dedicatoria del libro. Cuando la leí al principio dije como “oh, vaya, bueno”, pero ahora que la estoy releyendo y estoy escribiendo esta reseña, puedo decirles que casi lloro. Dice”For every Nesta out there, climb the mountain”.2. Las pesadillas que tiene Nesta nos dan una pista de todo lo que está batallando por dentro desde que la sumergieron en elCauldrony, joder, poco a poco entendemos por qué es como es. Nadie que lidie con pesadillas que describe como el frío antes de las estrellas, el vacío antes del infierno, puede siquiera fingir estar bien.3. ¿Cómo me atreví a juzgar a Nesta sin saber que ella sentía la inmortalidad como un fuego eterno y no como una serena juventud? Son estas pequeñas frases las que nos dan, incluso en las primeras páginas, las pistas que necesitamos para ver lo destrozada que está, que toda su mala actitud es una coraza para protegerse.4. Me rompe el corazón ver a Cassian al principio del libro admitiendo que el fuego helado de los ojos de Nesta siempre había sido una tentación para él. Y es que justo lo piensa cuando está en su apartamento destartalado en donde ella se ha estadofuckinga cuantos machos Fae quisiera y bebiendo hasta perder el conocimiento… Y lo peor es que Nesta tiene a un macho en su cuarto en ese momento. Agh.5. Y luego ella admite para sí misma que todo ese sexo con desconocidos, el alcohol y la música la ayuda a apagar un poco ese fuego frío y oscuro que la consume desde que la forzaron a entrar alCauldron. Nesta siempre ha estado muy rota y siento que la hemos juzgado demasiado sin saber exactamente lo mal que lo estaba pasando dentro de su cabeza.6. Lo triste es que hay una cita que dice que ese sexo no la hacía sentir nada más allá de un momento fugaz de liberación de ese poder cataclísmico que hay dentro de ella. Pero luego se ríe un poco y dice que incluso los siglos de experiencia que algunos machos Fae tienen no los hacen buenos en la cama, jajaja.7. EL HORROR del momento en el que Cassian vuelve a ese apartamento y le dice que se nota que ni siquiera se ha dignado a cambiar las sábanas entre sus visitantes PORQUE PUEDE OLERLOS. Dioses, en serio Nesta está en un punto muy bajo en ese momento.8. Es tremendo cuando Feyre y los demás le dan un ultimátum a Nesta: o accede a entrenar con Cassian por las mañanas y a ayudar a las acólitas de la biblioteca por las tardes e intenta enderezar su vida o la van a enviar de vuelta al mundo humano. Esa pelea y esa conversación son durísimas, pero tenían que darle un empujón para que empezara a salir de ese pozo.9. AMO A RHYSAND. Hay un momento en el que está hablando con Cassian después de la “intervention” de Nesta. Y Cass le dice que tiene que volver a entrenar porque no querría que Feyre, sumate, encontrara partes blandas en su cuerpo. Y RHYS RESPONDE QUE ELLA NUNCA ENCUENTRA NADA BLANDO Y OMG, JAJAJA. Y luego hablan de que Rhys les dio el día libre a los sirvientes y Cassian cree que es para que no los escuchen pelear después de lo de Nesta, pero Rhys le dice que no son las peleas lo que no quiere que escuchen, AIUDA.10. Se me rompió MAL el corazón cuando Cassian vio el retrato de Feyre y Rhys juntos, sus anillos y a ellos mismos y lo invadió ese sentimiento de querer lo que ellos tienen, a alguien especial a su lado. POBRECILLO MÍO.11. Ay, dioses, y más adelante Cassian dice que tiene que alejarse mucho de la casa del río porque no quiere ni oírlo ni sentir su poder cuando Rhys… acabe. PERO ES QUE ESO NO ES TODO. Luego menciona como quien no quiere la cosa que, cuando eran más jóvenes, Az, Rhys y Cassian se f*llaban a muchísimas hembras Y GENERALMENTE EN LA MISMA HABITACIÓN. ¿ES QUE NADIE VA A HABLAR DE ESTO? O sea… dioses. A mí nadie me puede quitar de la cabeza que esos tres…you know. QUIERO UNFANFICDE ESTO YA MISMO.12. AMO cada vez que Cassian molesta a Nesta recordándole lo mucho que le gusta leer novelas eróticas, jajaja.13. Uf, también me rompe el corazón los momentos en los que Nesta admite para sí misma que sabe lo desagradable que es con los demás, lo dura que es la coraza que la rodea y lo asustada que está ella misma de ese pozo infinito de poder oscuro que tiene dentro de ella. Y hay una cita en la que dice que siempre se sintió cómoda siendo como un lobo, como un depredador, pero que cuando llegó el momento de eliminar a ese ser feroz, se dio cuenta de que la había devorado incluso a ella.14. Ehhh… ¿podemos hablar de que Rhys sigue siendo un loquillo? Es que le habla por el vínculo mental a Cassian en medio de dos… eh…roundscon Feyre,if you know what I mean.15. A ver, todos sabemos que, tarde o temprano, Cassian y Nesta van a hacerlo sobre todas las superficies de la Casa, pero es que toda la tensión previa es la que me matabaaaaaa. ¡La tensión y las frases con doble sentido y los gruñidos bajos! En el primer día de entrenamiento, Cassian le dice a Nesta, con voz súper grave, que le alegra que se haya levantado lista para jugar. Y ELLA SE DERRITE AUNQUE NUNCA LO ACEPTARÁ EN VOZ ALTA… todavía.16. PERO LO QUE SÍ RECUERDA ES ESE MOMENTO EN LA BATALLA FINAL, ahhhh. O sea, cuando pensaron que iban a morir y él la besó y le dijo que desearía haber tenido más tiempo, pero que la encontrará en esta vida y las siguientes. Es que me muero. Y Nesta admite mentalmente que nunca deja de pensar en ese momento. Ayyyyyy, ya bésenseeeee.17. Sarah J. Maas me quiere matar porque luego Nesta dice que si Cassian cree que todo esto de entrenar va a terminar con ella subiéndose a su cama, que está muy equivocado. Y él dice que eso está clarísimo, que él no se va a subir a la cama de ella, PORQUE ES ELLA QUIEN VA A SUPLICAR ESTAR EN LA CAMA DE CASSIAN. AYUDA, NECESITO AGUA FRÍA.18. Y no soy la única que necesita hielo porque cuando Cassian ve a Nesta en losIllyrian leathersde entrenar, que son pantalones y equipo muy ajustado, el pobre casi muere y empieza a fantasear sobre todo lo que haría quitándole esos pantalones y… uf.19. Y justo después de esas fantasías Cassian recuerda que no ha tenido más compañía que su mano desde hace más de dos años, cuando lo hizo duro y rápido contra una pared de ladrillo con una hembra cualquiera que encontró en un bar. O SEA, CASSIAN ESTÁHORNYY LA QUE NOS ESPERA EN ESTE LIBRO… MADRE DE TODOS LOS DIOSES.20. Esos primeros días de entrenamiento cuando Cassian lleva a Nesta a Windhaven y ella se niega a levantarse de una roca y entrenar son tremendos. Y es obvio que todos losillyrianse están burlando de Cassian por dejar que una mujer tan terca le gane… y aunque Nesta sabe que lo está haciendo ver débil y lo odia, no puede ceder porque siente que es mejor que la odie a que se acerque. MI CORAZÓN.21. Parte de la razón por la que este libro me enseñó a no odiar a Nesta es que entendemos mucho más cómo piensa. Y me identifiqué un montón, de verdad. Verla a ella era verme a mí en los momentos más horrorosos de salud mental. Cuando ella dice que odia todo lo que es, que está absolutamente exhausta y que está cansada de querer estar en un lugar que no sea su cabeza… wow.I felt that.22. Me encantó la conversación que tienen Amren y Cassian en la que ella le dice que deje que Nesta cave su propia tumba, pero que al final le ofrezca su mano. Que no se rinda y siga ofreciéndole su ayuda para salir de ese lugar oscuro.23. FAAAAAAAN de que Lucien diga que Tamlin está sufriendo y que desde el final de la guerra no ha adoptado su forma Fae, sino que está vagando por su corte como la bestia que es.Fucker.24. Sabes que se vienen problemas cuando empiezas a enterarte de que las criaturas poderosísimas que inclinaron la balanza en favor de la Corte de la Noche tienen hermanos. En este caso, nos presentan a Koschei, el hermano delBone Carver. Y que parece que está aliado con Briallyn, una de las reinas que entró alCauldrony que ahora quiere recuperar laDread Trove, una colección de objetos poderosísimos, hechos por elCauldronmismo, que tiene el poder de empezar otra guerra y borrarlos a todos del mapa.Oh, joy.25. Hay una mañana en la que Nesta casi no puede moverse porque la noche anterior intentó bajar las 10.000 escaleras que separan a la Casa de Velaris. Y Cassian se da cuenta en el desayuno y la molesta con que no se puede ni parar. Y ella lo hace apoyándose un montón en sus manos, pero él le dice que no cuenta si son las manos las que están haciendo todo el trabajo. Y ELLA LE DICE QUE SON SUS MANOS LAS QUE DEBEN ESTAR OCUPADAS TODAS LAS NOCHES, OMG. Entonces Cassian le responde con voz grave que si es eso lo que le enseñan sus libros eróticos, que sólo se hace por la noche. Él nota Y HUELE lohotque se pone ella y sigue diciendo que se puede hacer en cualquier momento, con la luz del día, durante un baño o incluso después de una LARGA Y DURA sesión de entrenamiento. En serio, lean este libro con hielo a la mano.26. ¡Lo peor es que toda esa conversación sucede mientras Az también está en la mesa con ellos! Y al final, cuando Nesta se va, Azriel le dice a Cassian que lo va a tener muy jodido, pero él ya no lo está ni escuchando porque en su cabeza se está imaginando todo lo que las manos de Nesta podrían hacer con él y JODER, LES DIJE QUE ESTE LIBRO ES DEMASIADO CALIENTE. Y ESO QUE NO HA SUCEDIDO NADA.27. Uf, golpe bajo cuando, en medio de una pelea porque Nesta sigue negándose a entrenar en Windhaven, Cassian también explota y ella le responde diciéndole que genial, que menos mal ya no lo va a tener babeando detrás de ella y que le costó mucho entender las señales de que ella no lo quería. Y MALDITA SEA, OBVIAMENTE LO QUIERES. Y ÉL A TI. Pero también entiendo la reacción de querer alejar a todo el mundo cuando ni tú te soportas a ti misma.***SIGUE EN COMENTARIOS***",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53138095-a-court-of-silver-flames,A ​Court of Silver Flames.txt
A Court of Mist and Fury,"*spoilers alert**Warning! Overuse of the word fuck (courtesy of Ms. Maas who uses it freely in this book). If you have problems with swearing, do not read this review*Buddy read with my partners in disappointment:Katerina&Vera. Yay, we are freed from under the Mountain at last! And a special hug goes to my dear friendSimona(click on the names to see girls' reviews) You were right, dear, reading this book and, especially, discussing it is so much fun, indeed.First of all, let me show to you a simplediagram, where you can see how the level of my engagement toward this book...uh, plummeted (actually I wanted to make the diagram more vertical, but, well, I am not good with graphic stuff) with every chapter until nothing was left for me to enjoy.And let me tell you it was a rather bumpy and painful ride.Now, let's clarify a few things:- I am not a fan of ACOTAR. You can see inmy reviewwhy.- I had few expectations starting this book... ah hell, I had THE ONLY expectation - Rhysand.-I do not hate this book, I dislike it.<----- I am close to hating it now.This review is probably going to be a mess of thoughts with no structure, so I am sorry in advance if it's confusing, I just wanted to splash out my disappointment.I liked Rhys in the previous book; I liked his darkness. I knew he was not evil and had his reasons to act as he did, and I wanted to know why. I wanted him and Feyre together. But turns out, me and Rhys are never going to happen, not because he acts OOC (out of character) - after finishing the book, I know that he didn't act OOC - I dislike his sugary nature; there's too much goodness in him, he is practically a Saint: hell, he is the Saint among Fae!“We are lucky to have him, Feyre.” I turned from the door. “I have known many High Lords,” Amren continued, studying her paper. “Cruel ones, cunning ones, weak ones, powerful ones. But never one that dreamed. Not as he does.”“Dreams of what?” I breathed.“Of peace. Of freedom. Of a world united, a world thriving. Of something better—for all of us.”Of course, the other High Lords are stupid, they don't see the war coming, they are not interested in peace and prosperity, only Rhys does everything, and no one wants to listen to him.Poor baby.And let's not forget he is the strongest Fae out there.Here—here was the most powerful High Lord ever born.The face of dreams and nightmares.Only throughout the book, there was more than one situation where his ""mighty"" powers let him down.The question: why make him so powerful, impossibly so, if a little bit of vulnerability could've made him more real and likable, and suited the plot better. It's unnatural to be that good. He became a cardboard character with no backbone and lives only to serve Feyre, it seems.But, fuck, it wasn't even my biggest issue. I hated how Maascompared Tam and Rhys in this book all the time. I never liked Tam, but, seriously, how much shit you can splash on one person before he turns into shit himself? I pity Tam and what Maas did to him. Time and again Maas shoves down our throats how Rhys excels Tam in everything: Tam didn't want to talk to Feyre about his nightmares. Rhys wanted to talk and share. Tam never held her hair while she vomited her guts out every night (she does it a lot, by the way, nauseatingly so). Rhys held her hair and cuddled her:He never woke when the nightmares dragged me from sleep; never woke when I vomited my guts up night after night. If he knew or heard, he said nothing about it.Large, warm hands pulled my hair back a moment later.“Breathe,” Rhys said. “Imagine them winking out like candles, one by one.”I heaved into the toilet again, shuddering as light and heat crested and rushed out of me, and savored the empty, cool dark that pooled in their wake.Tam locked her up in the house and forbade her to participate in any action. Rhys allowed her to do whatever she wanted. Tam didn't let her visit his rooms. Rhys invited her to his;With Tamlin, he’d kept his own rooms and slept in mine. And I supposed—I supposed it’d be the same.I was almost to my bedroom door when Rhysand drawled from behind me, “We can use your room if you like, but … ” He was leaning against his open bedroom door. “Either your room or mine—but we’re sharing one from now on. Just tell me whether I should move my clothes or yours. If that’s all right with you.”Tam is starving his people. Rhys's people prosper (he probably gives them food for free). Tam said there are no High Ladies in Prythian. Rhys made Feyre High Lady of Night Court. Comparisons were in EVERYTHING like the author couldn't stop shoving up our asses how Tam is lesser than Rhys in every aspect you can think of. And all this is solely for Feyre to make it easier to dump Tam and switch to Rhys.Then there's Feyre and herlovesex life. Feyre said that she fell for the first guy who showed kindness to her.I’m thinking that I was a lonely, hopeless person, and I might have fallen in love with the first thing that showed me a hint of kindness and safety.But she can't - wouldn't - admit that it wasn't love that she felt for Tamlin. She, time and again, repeats it was love: she loved and sacrificed and then forgot the guy in two months' time. I would've respected her more if she admitted that it was lust.He buried his face in my neck and said onto my nape, as if the words would be absorbed by my body, as if he could only say it the way we’d always been good at communicating—skin to skin.Whyfeel guiltyabout wanting another male? But no, Feyre is Mary Sue, she can't be the simple girl who had a change of heart. She loved but had serious reasons to fell out of love.Easy-peasy. Heck, I would've respected her more if she was an elite prostitute serving High Lords and choosing her next lover without shame or labeling lust as love. But she is a hypocrite and Ihate hypocrites. It leads me to my next issue.Feyre/Rhysand. Honestly, I don't believe Tam loved Feyre, no, they just had a comfy agreement: fuck but don't ask questions. Rhys, on the other hand, I believe he really loved her. What about her? No. I am still not convinced it was love from Feyre's side; lust - yes. Again,Feyre has a pattern: when Rhys was a bad guy, she hated him, but when he started doing good stuff for her, she realized how good he is, how kind (don't forget this all is in comparison with Tam like we are stupid kids and can't fathom the universal truth: Rhys is good, Tam is bad);Feyre doesn't ""love"" Rhys despite his flaws, she ""loves"" him because he has no flaws.Mr. Purrfect Perfection. And when she finally admits she wants him, she still acts like a hypocrite by saying, ""But I loved Tam, deeply, I just don't any longer, because he treated me badly (I still don't get how splashing some paint on walls and locking her up once is abusive and the reason to easily fall out of love)."" Did you love him indeed? I want to ask for the thousandth time. Feyre just says she loved him to find an excuse to fuck Rhys. And that leads us to theirmating bond.When Feyre finds out they are mates, she relaxes and thinks, ""Fuck, what a relieve now that I know Tam and I was never going to happen, I don't have to feel guilty any longer for wanting to fuck Rhys"". But before we cover the mating process, let's touch on the snotty conversation they had. If you still had any doubts before that Rhys is a Saint, believe now that he is. He is a miracle reborn. Attention: he was always kind to Feyre even when he was a dick toward her. He loved her already when they were under the Mountain, he knew they are mates, it wrecked him to hurt her; he was jealous of unworthy Tam, but Rhys was noble and didn't want to ruin Feyre's life. And that sloppy melodramatic speech of his continues for a whole chapter!""A Court of snort and boredom""as someone on GR called it once (sorry, I don't remember who said that or I'd hug this person). And again, Rhy's goodness is shoved down our throats *gags*Mate.My—mate.This beautiful, strong, selfless male … Who had sacrificed and wrecked himself for his family, his people, and didn’t feel it was enough, that he wasn’t enough for anyone.Also, as we are on the topic... did you noticehow many times the phrase""my mate""is repeated in the book?!Hundreds of times! It's like a broken record player. I think if I hear ""mate"" one more time I may vomit like our Feyre-parrot does all the time.They fuck. It's a disaster of epic proportions. Mountain quacked. MOUNTAIN. QUACKED. Seriously? What was that? Some kind of cheap shapeshifter porn?Okay, When they are done, and I am done yawning, and we all move to civilized surroundings... wait, what the fuck is happening?!Rhys acts like an animal, he can't stop wanting to screw Feyre. Their mating bond makes them horny as fuck. He is so protective of his female. It's serious stuff among Fae folk, they could even kill if another male looks sideways at their females.“The … frenzy,” he said carefully, as if fearful the wrong word might send us both hurtling for each other before we could get sustenance into our bodies. “When a couple accepts the mating bond, it’s … overwhelming. Again, harkening back to the beasts we once were. Probably something about ensuring the female was impregnated.” My heart paused at that. “Some couples don’t leave the house for a week. Males get so volatile that it can be dangerous for them to be in public, anyway. I’ve seen males of reason and education shatter a room because another male looked too long in their mate’s direction, too soon after they’d been mated.”Faeries - cunning, highly intelligent, powerful creatures act as if they are primitive animals from a cheap porn novel. After Rhys loses some steam fighting his buddy, he goes and fucks Feyre against the table. Everyone outside hears and knows. Wonders! How civilized they are indeed! Are we supposed to find these animal games romantic? Does it suppose to be a healthy relationship?And this book is labeled as YA and published by Bloomsbury Children's!It is NA (new adult) or erotic at the very least!My next issue - the plot. First of all, let's not delude ourselves there's something more to the book apart from theromancemating.The plot is a crutch for the romance.Everything characters do, they do between Rhys's and Feyre's courting. And even these parts are poorly executed. Why, oh why, does Maas need to chew everything for us?! We are not stupid, we can get hints and would like to have some space left for the imagination.Show, don't tell.Show us through hints and glances, make us work for information; make us want to know! And the plot itself is primitive: go there, do that - monotone routine with no unexpected parts. 50% into the book and I have already known how everything would end.I don't understand the half-orgy scene in the Court of Nightmares where Feyre and Rhys were almost fucking while everyone watched. It was a distraction while the others were stealing something important. It's so stupid I can't even. Maas couldn't think of something smart for distraction, rather than thisdisgusting humiliating scene?! The best part is the ending, though. Why would mortal queens conspire with the King of Hybern? Because they want immortality? They'll get their immortality but will be slaves. Would it be worth it? I don't think so. And why demonstrate the experiment with humans turning into Fae twice? Wasn't one time enough, when Feyre's sister Elain was made into Fae? Why make the same with Nesta? Because it serves Maas's idea of making Feyre's sisters immortal and finding mighty mates for them. It doesn't matter that the plot looks illogical and stretched - everything is ideal for Maas's grand plans. Tam is a traitor because he wants Feyre back. Why, he is a reborn villain now! How stupid it is to betray your country, because of the woman who doesn't want you? Why villains in this book so villainous? Why there's no depth to them? Good is good, bad is bad. End of conversation.This book is 640 pages long. 640 pages of unnecessary descriptions of clothes, Rhys's goodness, Tam badness, Feyre's vomiting, mating, getting from point A to point B. 640 pages of parading High Lords to who I wouldn't trust to rule a swamp, let alone whole Kingdoms. Where's the smart and cunning in this book? And what kind of place is Night Court? Is it a mix of East and West and the modern world? Lace underwear, seriously?! Why does Night Court resemble so much human reality? Is this another point to Rhys's goodness? I have tons of questions toward this book, but I don't think getting my answers will somehow make it better. It's late for that.I wouldn't say there wasn't anything good about the book for me. Compared to Rhys and Feyre I liked secondary characters, and Cass and Nesta as a couple attract me more than Rhys and Feyre ever will. It's sad I am not interested in learning more about them in the context of this series.When I started this book, I practically had no expectations, and now I am angry. Angry at the book I wasn't even sure I would read in the first place! It's a new low. If this book was an erotic novel or NA, I would say, ""Good, we had sexy time"" - and move on. But this book pretends to be something different than it really is. Something more meaningful and deep, and it cruelly deceives people into thinking they are going to read a fantasy YA with a strong plotline and character development. They will be surprised to find an entirely different beast here. I am glad I am finally done with this series:no more, never again, burn in hell, book.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50659468-a-court-of-mist-and-fury,A Court of Mist and Fury.txt
Throne of Glass,"Are you kidding me? What the hell is this shit? How do you screw up your story quite so badly after starting from an INCREDIBLE premise involving the most notorious assassin in the land - now a slave - being offered the chance to win back her freedom, sort of, in a ""to-the-death tournament - fighting the most gifted thieves and assassins in the land"" [says the back of my book, conveniently forgetting that (a) right before the final duels, the king specifically states that the competitors ""can win only by trapping [their] opponent[s] in a position of sure death ... andno further"" soto-the-deathmy foot, and (b) apart from thieves and assassins, a number of the competitors are actually ex-guards and random other criminals, for the most part disposable enough not to warrant names, and I'd only consider a small handful of them to begiftedat anything]? I mean, you really have to be TALENTED to go from all of *that* Exciting Sounding Awesomeness to - well - toThrone of Glass.After reading the Q & A included in the back of my book, though, it all started to make sense, and I wish I'd knownbeforebuying this stupid-ass book that it's inspired byDISNEY'S CINDERELLA, of all things. I know what you're thinking:Where the fridge tart doesCinderellacome in? Isn't this story about, like, a TOUGH-AS-NAILS former-assassin-now-slave competing for her life in, like, the most badass tournamentever?Well ... actually, no. And I'm happy to spend the next few hours of my life quoting this most dumbass book if it means AT LEAST ONE PERSON might decide not to waste their money on it, no need to thank me.'""Wake up."" Not surprisingly, it was Chaol.She shimmied beneath the blankets, pulling them over her head, but he grabbed the covers and threw them to the floor. Her nightgown was wrapped around her thighs. Celaena shivered.""It's cold,"" she moaned, holding her knees to her body. She didn't care that she had only a few months to beat the other Champions - she neededsleep.[Nope, this isn't your bratty kid sister, but the most notorious assassin EVAH!

I know, right? Silly Crown Prince, not considering the feelings of, like, one of the most terrible criminals his men have ever captured. I mean, he gives you large, comfortable living quarters in his castle, a billiards table, a chance to change your life, even apuppy, and - what - he thinks this is enough?!]""Get up."" Chaol ripped the pillows from beneath her head. ""Now you're wasting my time."" If he noticed how much skin she was showing, he didn't react.[That wasn't irrelevant at all ... ]Grumbling, Celaena slithered to the edge of the bed, dangling a hand over the edge to touch the floor. ""Fetch my slippers,"" she mumbled. ""The floor's like ice.""[Yeah, put those servants in their place, Cinderella!]...From the doorway, Chaol asked, ""Why, might I ask, are you so tired?""She gulped down the rest of the pomegranate juice and wiped her mouth on a napkin. ""I was up until four reading,"" she said.'[Why do you even have to ask, Chaol? It's only the start of the tournament of Celaena's life; of course she stayed up all night reading. SLEEP WHEN YOU'RE DEAD, YO!! If the competition barely merits any page time, why should the competitors actually give a shit about it?!]'A few minutes later, Celaena frowned at herself as she hurried after the captain into the foyer.

And what books do you love?"" He named a few, and she blinked. ""Well, those are good choices - for the most part. What others?"" she asked, and somehow, an hour flew by, carrying them on the wings of conversation.'[Jesus. This paragraph isn't a pointless waste of space at all.]'There was something girlish about her, too. Oh, he couldn't stand her contradictions!'[INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS!!!

The Champion who hadn't shown up for the Test had been found dead in a servant's stairwell, brutally mauled and dismembered.The new murder cast a pall over the next two weeks, and the two Tests they brought with them.

All found in forgotten[well, obviously notthatforgotten]hallways; all mutilated beyond recognition.'[The plot overload! It's ... it's ... positively ... unbearable ... ]'Amidst her worrying, another Test passed without incident or embarrassment - though she couldn't say the same for the soldier who'd been sent home - and she kept up her intense training with Chaol and the other Champions.'[WOW: So Much Story! How can I process it all?]'""Candy!"" A large paper bag sat on a pillow, and she found that it was filled with all sorts of confectionary goodies. There was no note, not even a name scribbled on the bag. With a shrug and glowing eyes, Celaena pulled out a handful of sweets. Oh, how sheadoredcandy!Celaena issued a jolly laugh and crammed some of the candy into her mouth....""Someone,"" she said in between chews, ""isverygood to me.""'[I just ... oh God ... I have no words! :D Cookie Monster strikes again?]'""Of course I want her,"" Celaena said, then realized what the implications would be. ""But I want her trained. I don't want her urinating on everything and chewing on furniture and shoes and books. And I want her to sit when I tell her to and lay down and roll over and whatever it is that dogs do. And I want her to run - run with the other dogs when they're practicing. I want her to put those long legs to use.""Dorian crossed his arms as Celaena scooped up the dog. ""That's a long list of demands. Perhaps I should have bought you jewelry after all.""[Hold your puppies, Dorian,CINDERDIVASTILL isn't done.]""When I'm training"" - she kissed the pup's soft head, and the dog nestled her cold nose against Celaena's neck - ""I want her in the kennels, training as well. When I return in the afternoon, she may be brought to me. I'll keep her in the night."" Celaena held the dog at eye level. The dog kicked her legs in the air. ""If you ruin any of my shoes,"" she said to the pup, ""I'll turn you into a pair of slippers. Understood?""'[Jesus Christ. Is it bad that what *I* want is for someone to rend Celaena limb from limb?

As for the main character, well, I don't even know what to call her. Selena? Kay-lay-na? (that's the one I eventually settled on, after spending half the book mentally mumbling her name) I mean, what in Erilea kind of a name is Celaena? Is it really any wonder that Nehemia eventually renames her?! Other people get normal enough names, such as Dorian and Grave and Sam and Elena and Xavier and Cain and Philippa and Verin and Ned; simple names, really. I guess the special snowflake needs a special name to go with her very special personality impairment. Don't even try to get me started on the place names, because I tuned them out after Eyllwe, so I have no idea how these countries / lands / coffee beans relate to one another, but I'll probably live.And what is even the point of the glass castle? Or the non-existentthrone of glassthat the book's apparently named after? Thinly-veiledCINDERELLAreferences FTW!!!! If you ask me, the author should have gone forCinderella in Candyfloss Land!, because you certainly don't get much more than that. I don't even know what Celaena spends most of the second half of the book doing. The tournament trials and murders are mentioned in passing here and there (Yesterday we threw knives! Another three people were eaten over the past three weeks!) and the book focuses on - I don't know what - Celaena sitting in her room, Celaena fawning over herself in front of one mirror or another, Celaena boasting about her amazing assassin skills that you'd otherwise never know she had, Celaena going for walks, Celaena admiring pouffalicious dresses,CinderellaCelaena wishing someone would invite her to the ball, Celaena eating sweets, Evil King being evil, and Frolicking Unicorn being high.

The Lightning Thief,"Chiron looked surprised. “I thought that would be obvious enough.The entrance to the Underworld is in Los Angeles.”As someone who has worked in Los Angeles, I can tell you that this is completely accurate.While Harry Potter was spending his summers at the Dursleys, Percy Jackson attended Camp Half-Blood. This book has done the impossible:it has redeemed the name of Percy.Yes, that's right, that snot-faced, lily-livered waste of air of the very same name from theHarry Potteruniverse. That name is now relegated to the ranks of ""acceptable,"" because of my love for this book.Perseus (Percy) Jackson is the kind of kid with whom you can't help sympathizing. He is the type that's born under a dark star, because inevitably, wherever he goes, whatever he does, however good his intentions, he can't help but fuck everything up. Everything that can, does and will go wrong. A simple field trip can turn into a disaster in seconds.Jay-Z's got 99 problems, Percy might have more. He nearly flunks all his classes, he's got dyslexia, he's got ADHD, and then there's Nancy Bobofit.Nancy Bobofit appeared in front of me with her ugly friends—I guess she’d gotten tired of stealing from the tourists—and dumped her half-eaten lunch in Grover’s lap.“Oops.” She grinned at me with her crooked teeth. Her freckles were orange, as if somebody had spray-painted her face with liquid Cheetos.Nancy Bobofit is not a major character in the book. I have to mention her because her character resounded with me. I had my own Nancy Bobofit back in grade school, only her name is Mimi. Nearly 2 decades later, the memory of her horrible face still makes me shudder. But I digress.As if the bullies aren't bad enough, his dad is a no-show, his stepfather is LITERALLY named Ugli, and there are crones foretelling Percy's death as well as a minotaur chasing his ass around. AND NOBODY'S TELLING HIM A SINGLE FUCKING THING. What's with all the secrecy, man?As it turned out, Percy is *whispers* special. He is a half-blood, meaning one of his parents is a Greek deity. He gets sent to Camp Half-Blood, with roughly 100 other kids like him.It's a freaky place for a kid who's known nothing but relative normalcy his entire life. All of a sudden, he's playing Pinochle with a Greek God (Dionysus---what a drunk), his best friend Grover turns out to be a satyr, and the gorgeous blond girl who rescues him thinks he's a doofus and she keeps calling him""seaweed brain.""To be fair, Percy had it coming. He is kind of a seaweed brain.""Another time, Athena and Poseidon competed to be the patron god for the city of Athens. Your dad created some stupid saltwater spring for his gift. My mom created the olive tree. The people saw that her gift was better, so they named the city after her.”“They must really like olives.”“Oh, forget it.”“Now, if she’d invented pizza—that I could understand.”“I said, forget it!”Not your best moment, Percy.As it turned out, Percy IS special. His dad is one of the Big Three gods. Which kind of sucks, because that's not supposed to happen.“About sixty years ago, after World War II, the Big Three agreed they wouldn’t sire any more heroes. Their children were just too powerful.""A lot of people would think it was pretty cool to have such a powerful dad...not really.Now that I was declared a son of one of the Big Three gods who weren’t supposed to have kids, I figured it was a crime for me just to be alive.Not only does Percy have to struggle to fit in at Camp Half-Blood, but there's some shit going on in Mount Olympus. The gods are fighting again (when are they not)...""During the winter solstice, at the last council of the gods, Zeus and Poseidon had an argument. The usual nonsense: ‘Mother Rhea always liked you best,’ ‘Air disasters are more spectacular than sea disasters,’ et cetera.""...and consequently, like a brother playing a prank on his younger siblings, someone's stuff was stolen. And Zeus thinks that his bro, Poseidon, put Percy up to it.Of course, blame the poor kid. Now Percy is shit out of luck YET AGAIN, and he's got no choice but to go on this huge stupid quest into the underworld (Los Angeles, ha!) to clear his name.He's not alone, he's accompanied by thesnarky, gorgeous, fiercely competent Annabeth(she of the seaweed brain name-calling), as well asthe most incompetent satyr that ever lived.In his pocket was a set of reed pipes his daddy goat had carved for him, even though he only knew two songs: Mozart’s Piano Concerto no. 12 and Hilary Duff’s “So Yesterday,” both of which sounded pretty bad on reed pipes.It's going to be a loooooooong trip to the Underworld.The Setting: THIS. THIS IS HOW YOU DO GREEK MYTHOLOGY. I am a Greek mythology buff. I FUCKING LOVED THIS BOOK. This book is just absolutely fucking perfect in every way when it comes to rewriting and reinterpreting the Greek pantheon. It is so hilariously, awesomely irreverent, but completely fitting. The gods are reimagined, but they stay true to their true nature, andthe myths are retold in a cheeky, flippant manner that had me giggling my ass off. This book is so fantastically snarky to the Greek gods. Everything is incredibly well-explained to a lay audience, like how the Greek gods can't seem to keep it in their pants.Annabeth nodded. “Your father isn’t dead, Percy. He’s one of the Olympians.”“That’s...crazy.”“Is it? What’s the most common thing gods did in the old stories? They ran around falling in love with humans and having kids with them. Do you think they’ve changed their habits in the last few millennia?”And apparently, the habit runs true for both male and female goddesses.“What? You assume it has to be a male god who finds a human female attractive? How sexist is that?”The existence of Greek gods and goddesses themselves are well explained, and believable.“Come now, Percy. What you call ‘Western civilization.’ Do you think it’s just an abstract concept? No, it’s a living force. A collective consciousness that has burned bright for thousands of years. The gods are part of it.""""Did the West die? The gods simply moved, to Germany, to France, to Spain, for a while. Wherever the flame was brightest, the gods were there. They spent several centuries in England. All you need to do is look at the architecture. People do not forget the gods.""I had my doubts about the execution of the premise of Greek mythology, and all my doubts have been destroyed.his book does great justice to the Greek gods, it is the most faithful rendition than I have ever read.The Characters: Yes, Percy is a special snowflake, but HELL, I LOVED THE LITTLE SHIT. He's got a special destiny. He is a special child. I DON'T CARE. Percy is such a sympathetic character, and although he won't be replacing Harry Potter in my heart any time soon, there is a special spot for him. He can give up pretty fast. He's kind of a wimp, but you know, finding out that you're a hald-blooded demigod is kind of a big deal, and I understand his attitude of ""GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.""I didn’t know what else to do. I waved back.“Don’t encourage them,” Annabeth warned. “Naiads are terrible flirts.”“Naiads,” I repeated, feeling completely overwhelmed. “That’s it. I want to go home now.”He doesn't really want to do anything big. He's pretty stupid sometimes (Auntie Em, geez), he's not exactly heroic. He only does the heroic shit when there are no other options.“All right,” I said. “It’s better than being turned into a dolphin.”I loved Annabeth, she is all I could want from a female supporting character. I can't say that I'm fond of Grover...but I can't help feeling that we'll be seeing more of him in the future.“But a quest to . . .” Grover swallowed. “I mean, couldn’t the master bolt be in some place like Maine? Maine’s very nice this time of year.”Overall: a fantastic book.A good middle grade book makes you feel like a child again, and this book did just the trick.I found myself giggling throughout the book, and an hour after reading it, there's still a smile on my face that can't be wiped off.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123675190-the-lightning-thief,The Lightning Thief.txt
The Poppy War,"”Children ceased to be children when you put a sword in their hands. When you taught them to fight a war, then you armed them and put them on the front lines, they were not children anymore. They were soldiers.”This book. I mean…THIS BOOK! *sighs deeply and shakes head*There is so much to be said about “The Poppy War” and I’m afraid I won’t even be able to put at least half of my thoughts into decent sentences. Because after finishing this book about a month ago(A MONTH AGO!!!)I still have troubles to sort out all of my feelings and thoughts.“The Poppy War”is a great book but it tackles a lot of serious topics and I guess that’s the reason why my heart always feels kind of heavy when I think about it. Of course there is a war raging in this book but there happen so many other things that it’s almost impossible not to flinch when you reach those final 40%. Think about every atrocity that’s ever happened and you get a good idea about what you’re going to read in this book. There’s genocide, rape, torture, self-harm… and that’s just me naming a few of the triggers that might come your way.”War doesn’t determine who’s right. War determines who remains.”Let me tell you this: The longer you continue the worse it gets and even though this was masterfully done and I loved the world building and all the characters, there is still this strange undercurrent of heavy sadness and dread. Golyn Niis was so tough to read, I still get goose bumps when I think about it. This chapter was so, so, so, so damn hard to get through and I can’t remember the last time I read a book and felt that way. Maybe I never felt that way reading a book before. At least I can’t remember a single book that actually made me feel like this. I swear my stomach turned and I had troubles to breathe. I was feeling nauseous reading a book! Yes, it was that heavy! Everyone who already read the book will know what I’m talking about and to those who didn’t: It’s really as bad as everyone claims it to be! I got plenty of warnings but nothing prepared me for Golyn Niis!”Amateurs obsess over strategy, Irjah had once told their class. Professionals obsess over logistics.”Still, despite this heavy feeling of uneasiness that always overcomes me when I think about “The Poppy War” this book was definitely worth reading! I loved the fantasy elements and the idea of powers from the gods! Plus I really enjoyed the chapters at Sinegard Academy and the chimei! What I loved the most was the representation of human nature though. I might be alone with this but it’s obvious that R.F. Kuang put a lot of effort into her characters and you could see it in the way they grow, develop and change. Their character arcs were so amazing to follow, I’m in awe! And before I continue to gush about them here, I might as well move to my character section instead. ;-PThe characters:This is my spoilery spoiler section and if you didn’t read the book already you better turn around and leave. If you’re still curious and don’t want to heed my warning you may proceed at your own risk! I mean I warned you, right? ;-PRin:”No – they couldn’t just do this to her. They might think they could sweep her away like rubbish, but she didn’t have to lie down and take it. She had come from nothing. She wasn’t going back to nothing.”Oh gods! Rin! I can’t believe what she did in the end and I can’t wrap my head around the fact that such a sweet and innocent girl could change that much! But it still happened and her descent was so heavy to watch. >_< I guess that’s what happens when you play with fire, quite literally in her case. She got addicted to the power and I’m so damn afraid of what she’s going to do next! I loved her defiance and strength at the beginning of the book, how she wanted to learn and did everything possible to achieve her goal. She was so determined and strong-willed! But then the war began and all those things happened and with every chapter Rin changed! She became something different, she hardened her heart, she lost her moral compass and made decisions that got her deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole! And then she did the unthinkable and I’m not sure if she’ll ever be able to return from that darkness again. T_T The ending broke my heart, for Rin, for the person she could have been for everything sheHADbeen before she came to Sinegard. She’s not the person she used to be and I find myself weeping for everything she lost and for what she became. =(((”She didn’t want to be possessed. She wanted to remain free.””Then I will die on my feet,” she said. “I will die with flames in my hand and fury in my heart.””My god didn’t make me do anything,” she said. “The gods can’t make our choices for us. They can only offer their power, and we can wield it. And I did, and this is what I chose.” She swallowed. “I don’t regret it.””She was sane, she was convinced of it. She was whole. She had lost much, yes, but she still had her own mind. She made her decisions. She chose to accept the Phoenix. She chose to let it invade her mind.”Altan:”We’re the final front,” said Altan. “If we fail, this country’s lost.” He clapped her on the shoulder. “Excited?”Altan broke my heart. At first I had the same impression like everyone else: That he knows what he’s doing, that he’s in control and a perfect student/soldier but the more we got to see from him, the more it became obvious that he’s far from all those things! This boy was broken beyond repair and he hid it so well that no one ever noticed until it was too late! I can’t say that I liked his actions but I could understand why he acted the way he did! He was lashing out at everyone because he was like a wild animal that only saw threats and didn’t know how to react to kindness. Altan was unable to see that not everyone who confronted him wanted to do him harm. Which makes me sad on so many levels. =( That poor, poor boy! To be tortured like this, to get out of it alive, to live with his past and the knowledge that it might happen again. Just to live with everything he went through! To draw breath every day and to continue, to keep on moving! I can’t even begin to comprehend how he must have felt and I can’t put into words how strongly I feel for him. T_T And I don’t want to believe that he’s dead! He can’t be dead! >_<”I don’t know,” he said after a long moment. “I don’t know what I’m doing.””Altan’s fire drew as its source an unending hate. It was a deep, slow burn. She could almost taste it, the venomous intent, the ancient misery, and it horrified her.How could one person hate so much?What had happened to him?Kitay:”One urinating statue for my easily entertained friend.”Rin blushed. “Kitay, I can’t.”“It costs nothing.”“It costs a lot to me,” she said.Kitay placed the statue in her hand. “If you say one more thing about money, I’m leaving you to get lost.”I absolutely adored Kitay! He’s such a good friend and I loved that Rin and he became besties. =) Despite being fortunate enough to be one of the rich kids at Sinegard Academy he still reached out to her and became her friend. I think that’s what I loved about him the most, he didn’t care about titles or money, he just cared about the person and what it could do! Kitay is the living and breathing proof that good people exist and in the end his character was the only one that gave me any hope. Because despite all the things he witnessed and regardless of everything that happened to him, he still had moral values and acted according to them. In a world so harsh and cruel that it changed everyone around him, he still held on to his convictions and I loved him for it! <333”There was a hard glint to his eyes that she had never seen in him before. He looked as if he had aged five years. He looked like his father. He was like a sword that had been sharpened, metal that had been tempered.”Jiang:”I am a mortal who has woken up, and there is power in awareness.”I really don’t know how to feel about Jiang! I actually liked him at the beginning of the book but I was so disappointed by him when it ended. His character was some sort of catalyst and I had the distinct feeling that he could have done more, that he SHOUD HAVE done more! What if he would have taught Rin about her powers? What if he would have allowed her to use them in a safe setting? What if he would have fought alongside them and would have helped her to control the phoenix? He basically left Altan and Rin to their own devices and this set them on the dark path they were descending at the end. How different everything could have gone if Jiang would have watched out for them! =( To drop Altan as his student was the first mistake he made and not to teach Rin properly apparently his last.”Ah. The law.” Jiang sniffed at an unidentified leaf and then tossed it away. “So inconvenient. So irrelevant.”The relationships & ships:Rin & Altan:”She knew what addiction looked like. Opium smokers were yellowed, useless sacks of flesh. They did not fight like Altan did. They did not move like Altan did. They were not perfect, lethal animals of graceful beauty.”Okay, I’m going to say it:I DIDN’T SHIP RIN AND ALTAN!I’m sorry but I just couldn’t! They didn’t have much of a relationship before Rin joined the Cike and once she was a part of them her relationship with Altan was nothing but abusive. He slapped her, hurt her with words, forced her to do things she didn’t want to do and was everything else but supportive. How was I supposed to ship that? I get that Altan was thoroughly broken but he didn’t have to let it out on Rin and as frustrated as he might have been with her, he still had no right to hurt her. So nope, it was clear right from the beginning that he didn’t respect her as much as she respected him and if you ask me those two never had a future. (Not saying that I wouldn’t love for Altan to come back again. I still wouldn’t ship him with Rin though) I’ll never ship those two and I stand by it. Fight me! *lol* ;-P”Hey. Hey.”Cool fingers wrapped around her wrists. Gently, Altan pulled her hands away from her face. She looked up and met his eyes. They were a shade of crimson brighter than poppy petals.“It’s okay,” he said. “I know. I know what it’s like. I’m going to help you.””She had adored an idea of him, an archetype, a version of him that was invulnerable. But now she knew the truth, she knew the realness of Altan and his vulnerabilities and most of all his pain… and still she loved him.”He leaned forward and grasped her face in both hands. She thought for a bizarre moment that he was going to kiss her. He didn’t. He pressed his forehead against hers for a long time. She closed her eyes. She drank in the sensation of her skin against his. She seared it into her memory.”Rin & Nezha:”We aren’t here to be sophisticated. We’re here to fuck people up.”Now that’s a relationship I could appreciate! Yes, Nezha was an ass at the beginning of the book but in contrast to Altan he actually realized his faults and apologized to Rin. I loved how they both grew out of their initial animosity and became friends in the end. And those fighting scenes!! They were pure harmony on the battlefield and anyone who claims differently didn’t read the book! XD Just like Kitay seemed to have become a moral compass for Rin the same could be said for Nezha and I’m sure if he’d been around at the end she wouldn’t have gone down that dark road. >_< Unfortunately Nezha was lost in the toxic mist and seems to be dead. I refuse to believe that he’s gone for good though. I mean he had some serious healing abilities so maybe he survived it and became a prisoner? But then again he most likely would have been with the Mugenese when Rin launched her attack and I don’t know if he would have been able to survive this as well. >_< I really hope Nezha will magically reappear in the second book! =)”But I saved your life. Doesn’t that make us at least a little square?”Square? Square? She had to laugh. “You almost got me expelled!”“And you almost killed me,” he said. That shut her up.“I was scared of you,” Nezha continued. “And I lashed out. I was stupid. I was a spoiled brat. I was a real pain in the ass. I thought I was better than you, and I’m not. I’m sorry.”Altan & Chaghan:”They had come to an understanding, she and Chaghan. They were no longer opposed, vying for Altan’s favor. They were allies, now, bound by the mutual atrocities they had commited.”I’m going to be honest here: I’m such a sucker for Chaghan!!! I love his character!!!! And is it just me or did I actually feel some gay vibes between those two?! Altan and Chaghan definitely had more chemistry than Rin and Altan ever had! *lol* And they didn’t even have all too many scenes together! I got the distinct feeling that something happened when they spent those three days in the valleys and I’m not talking about Altan winning a fight between them, feel me? *wriggles eyebrows* Haha! ;-P Gosh, I really would have loved to find out more about their relationship and this is just one more reason why Altan can’t be dead! I just ship him and Chaghan too much to accept his death! Period! XDConclusion:“The Poppy War”was an amazing and sometimes truly revolting dark tale about a young girl that follows her own path and fights for what she thinks is right. It shows us how people can grow and how their circumstances and perceptions can change them. For better or for worse… This tale isn’t over yet. In fact it just began and I can’t wait to read what’s going to happen next. Let’s continue to hope for the best while we expect the worst, because apparently that’s the only attitude that will get you through this series. ;-)”And she would call the gods to do such terrible things.”",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35068705-the-poppy-war,The Poppy War.txt
Legendary,"Meehhh. What a disappointment.***Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog***Legendary by Stephanie GarberBook Two of the Caraval seriesPublisher: Flatiron BooksPublication Date: May 29, 2018Rating: 3 starsSource: eARC from NetGalleySummary (from Goodreads):A heart to protect. A debt to repay. A game to win.After being swept up in the magical world of Caraval, Donatella Dragna has finally escaped her father and saved her sister Scarlett from a disastrous arranged marriage. The girls should be celebrating, but Tella isn’t yet free. She made a desperate bargain with a mysterious criminal, and what Tella owes him no one has ever been able to deliver: Caraval Master Legend’s true name.The only chance of uncovering Legend’s identity is to win Caraval, so Tella throws herself into the legendary competition once more—and into the path of the murderous heir to the throne, a doomed love story, and a web of secrets…including her sister's. Caraval has always demanded bravery, cunning, and sacrifice. But now the game is asking for more. If Tella can’t fulfill her bargain and deliver Legend’s name, she’ll lose everything she cares about—maybe even her life. But if she wins, Legend and Caraval will be destroyed forever.Welcome, welcome to Caraval...the games have only just begun.What I Liked:I'm actually a bit disappointed by this book, which is of course very surprise given how much I loved Caraval, and given how much everyone has loved Legendary. I felt so meh about this book while reading it, and when I finished it, I was left with a rather sour taste in my mouth. Definitely not what you would want to feel after reading a supposed masterpiece. But these things happen.Caraval followed Scarlett Dragna, who entered Caraval in order to save her younger sister Donnatella. Legendary follows Tella, who enters Caraval in order to save her and Scarlett's mother Paloma, who has been missing for years. Paloma is trapped in a card of the Deck of Destiny, a cursed deck of cards that contains the Fates. If the Fates are released, chaos will ensue (or something like that). If Legend gets the Deck, he could gain the powers of all of the Fates in the Deck. In order to save her mother, Tella must find the Deck of Destiny. In order to uphold her bargain with a mysterious criminal who gave her information about her mother, Tella must give the criminal Legend's true identity. Tella has neither of those things, and so she must enter Caraval and win - so that she will receive the ultimate prize from Legend. It's a tricky game that Tella is playing, and it is not without consequences - or sacrifices.In the first half of the book, I was pretty engrossed in the story. I wasn't totally sold on the whole finding-my-mother thing, but I was intrigued, and I liked Tella. I liked seeing Scarlett and Julian, though I hated the unnecessary drama (more on that below). I looooved Dante's appearances. I even loved Jacks' ridiculous, cruel self. The first half of the book was so fascinating.I liked Tella for the most part. In book one, I pretty much hated her and branded her the most selfish, unworthy sister ever. But I liked her in this book. She is bold and uninhibited, and while she seemed selfish in Caraval, she seems more selfless in this book. It's clear that she loves her sister, but is very guarded. She is selfless when it comes to Paloma, which is how this book came to be. Finding her mother is so important to Tella.I adored Dante and his wicked, charming self. I actually didn't totally care for him in book one, but he's so swoony and magical in this book. And not just in a love interest kind of way - the game of Caraval would not be the same without his presence. He's a charming devil, but he's also kind and sweet. He has a commanding presence about him and he has a way of popping up whenever he is needed (and whenever he isn't).There are many Scarlett/Julian cameos which I appreciate, though I wish they were all happy cameos showing Scarlett and Julian helplessly in love. I guess that will have to wait until Finale. Still, I'm glad that Julian and Scarlett are part of this book, and an important part.I liked the Dante/Tella romance, but there wasn't nearly enough. The author teased with this romance.Once I reached the second half of the book, I was kind of finished with it all. I'll talk about all of my dislikes next. I can't even say I liked the ending.What I Did Not Like:Ugh, where do I even begin? I just felt so meh about this book at the halfway mark and beyond. What went wrong, you might ask? I have no idea.I was never truly sold on the whole I-must-find-my-mother plot. It seemed forced and contrived, like the author desperately needed a good reason to bring back Caraval for a second time in a short period (like The Hunger Games), and so she grasped at straws and came up with Scarlett and Tella's missing mother. I just never bought into that plot. It didn't feel important.I didn't care for the barely-there tease of a romance that was Dante/Tella. I loved Dante. I liked Tella. I loved Dante/Tella. I didn't love the lack of kisses and swoon.And the implicated love triangle - for both Tella and Scarlett! Like two completely separate love triangles going on! What the heck! I thought Julian/Scarlett was a done deal but apparently not. You know what I hate? When girls want to make their man jealous and so they flirt with someone else. Or go find their ex. And they call it ""exploring their options"" or some bull***t and they want to bring about some competition between their man and the ex/side man. For real? This isn't cute. There's nothing wrong with dating. But there IS something wrong when you claim you love someone and yet you go look for your ex or another man just to make the man you love jealous, or some bull***. That's playing games and it's maddening. I'm talking about Scarlett.Oh but Tella is embroiled in her own love triangle, don't you worry. I know she is in love with Dante by the end of the story, and I know he loves her, but there is another guy that seems to be in love with Tella and noooooooo thank you. I actually LOVE this character and I wouldn't mind a Tella/This Character pairing IF Dante had never existed. Meaning, This Character as a love interest is so unnecessary. Why though. Why.Speaking of unnecessary, let's talking about all the unnecessary drama that is in this book. I already talked about Scarlett's bull**** that she's pulling with Julian, but I hate that she also let's so many factors bring down their relationship. She takes every little thing as a reason not to trust him. She knows who he is, what his role in Caraval is, and yet she whines about it all the time. I liked Scarlett in the first book. But she really got on my nerves in this book. And as much as I liked seeing her and Julian in this book, I would appreciated it more if there was less drama and more swoon. More of them working together as a couple, rather than Scarlett acting like a crazy girlfriend who runs off to her exes every time she believes something about her man (to put the situation in modern terms; Scarlett technically never runs to any exes, but hopefully you understand the picture I'm trying to paint). The drama is just so unnecessary. But I guess it's middle-book drama?I think this is part of my frustration with YA these days - the drama is so unnecessary, and sequels tend to suck. In adult romance, a book is a standalone and the story is done within that one book. Thank goodness.The ending of this book is not a happy ending. For anyone.Would I Recommend It:Honestly, this is one of those books where you have to read it yourself. Decide for yourself. 99% of the people who read this book love it, so what do I know? I felt so meh while reading at least half of this book. And the ending made me so sour. Not just because of the obvious love triangles, but because of the drama, and the cliffhanger, and it was just so stupid.But again, decide for yourself. I would say that if you're on the fence, maybe just stop with the first book. Wait until the third book publishes and binge-read the series. Or just stop with Caraval. Caraval had a lovely ending and you can imagine an epilogue of Scarlett and Julian 40 years down the road, happily ever after. No need to read about unnecessary drama.Rating:2.5 stars -> rounded up to 3 stars. Perhaps I'm being generous, and maybe I just really wanted to love the book. I was so excited about it and so prepared to love it like I did Caraval. But I'm glad I didn't buy this book because I would have regretted. I'm happy to have had the opportunity to review it (I was supposed to post this review two months ago, whoops), but I would have regretted spending the money on it. I will read Finale but it'll be a library request from me.Pre-read squees:MEEEEEEE, I WANT IT!!!!!!!!!!!",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36329818-legendary,Legendary.txt
The Queen of Nothing,"1.)The Cruel Prince★★★★★1.5)The Lost Sisters★★★★★2.)The Wicked King★★★★★“By you, I am forever undone.”I can’t believe it’s over. I feel like I’ve been in love with Holly Black’s fae stories my entire life and seeing this series finally close means more to me than I have words for, truly. This series, this world, these characters, have brought me so much unconditional happiness, and I truly am not ready to say goodbye, but I do think this was a very perfect ending.Also, a couple things before I start this actual review: 1.)I vlogged this entire reading experience(and how I wrote this review) and I hope you enjoy! 2.) This review will talk about events that happened inThe Cruel Prince,The Lost Sisters, &The Wicked King, so please use caution while reading! And I will have a spoiler section for QoN later!After the very heartbreaking end ofThe Wicked King, Jude is now exiled from Faerie and a crown that no one knows she wears. Madoc is ready and willing to do anything to put Oak or himself on the throne, regardless of what Oak wants while living in the mortal realm with Vivi. Taryn is now married to Locke, for better or for worse, and regardless of what Jude thinks on the matter.“We have lived in our armor for so long, you and I. And now I am not sure if either of us knows how to remove it.”Everything feels like it is chaos, and at the start of this book we see Jude slowly accept her fate, while also learning the pain of her anger and betrayal. She is taking side-jobs from the fae residing among humans, and she just takes on a job that is about to really test her skills. Especially when she comes out of the job realizing that things might really not be going that great for Cardan in the realm of the fae. But Jude doesn’t care, right? But she gets an opportunity to go to faerie and see for herself, regardless of her exiled status, and the situation is a matter of life and death.It’s hard to say anything else without going into spoiler territory, but I truly loved this book so much. I can’t believe how much Holly Black was able to surprise me, especially with the amount of theorycrafting I truly believed I did. From the cover, to the title, to the sneak peaks we were given; I was truly not ready for the twists and turns of this book and this entire trilogy is just masterfully crafted.“I spent much of my life guarding my heart. I guarded it so well that I could behave as though I didn’t have one at all.”And at the heart of this book, I just really enjoyed the theme and discussion of all the different and complex relationships we will have in our lives. We see Jude constantly battling with herself and her feelings; from her past to her future, from her family to her crown, from her feelings to her heart. There are so many wars in this book, but most of them truly are from within Jude, and Holly Black really expertly talks about the human experience and existence.“But for one final night, he’s the father I remember best, the one in whose shadow I have—for better or worse—become what I am.”Relationships can be so very hard and so very not pretty. Obviously we get to see Jude and Cardan, obviously we get to see Jude and her sisters, but seeing Jude and Madoc? That’s what kept breaking me. How do you love a father who became your father by killing your own? A father that loves you so very much, but loves power more? Jude and Madoc are truly the kings of this book and this chessboard, and their dynamic is truly unlike one I’ve read before. So heartbreakingly beautiful, truly.This next section of my review is going to haveSPOILERS! Please do not read on if you have not readThe Queen of Nothingand all the rest of the books in this series! Also, like always, I’m going to do fangirl breakdowns because it warms my heart.“It feels good to be fighting someone other than myself.”➽Jude Duarte- My actual queen. Seeing Jude realize not only her worth, but that it is okay to hurt and to be angry, yet also that it is worth the risk to let people in sometimes; I don’t even have words, friends. Jude’s pain just resonated so much inside my heart and soul and I truly think she is one of the best literary characters I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading about.“He’s so beautiful, so perfectly, horribly, inhumanly beautiful that I can barely breathe.”➽Cardan Greenbriar- My entire heart. All of Cardan’s lines truly broke and healed me throughout this entire book. Seeing him be the king of his people’s dreams, but also the king of his own dreams? Forever crying. Also, we stan an otp power couple for life. Truly, for life; Jude, please never leave faerie again.➽Nicasia- We love a good redemption arc, wow.➽Grima Mog- Nothing but love and respect for my war general.➽Taryn Duarte- Oh Taryn. Listen, her pregnancy was expected, but her actually killing Locke was not. I will say that I think this was the weakest part of the story, and I truly wish we could have seen more, but maybe Holly Black is going to give us another few novellas or something. Especially with a certain bard boy? But seriously, I need so many more answers.➽Vivi- My 2019 bi-icon. I was rooting for Vivi and Heather so damn hard, and I was so scared at what Vivi was going to do this book, but she was amazing through and through. When she told Madoc to bring his entire army? The biggest flex in all of 2019 literature and I was quaking.➽Oak- Wow, I’m going to love me a good spin-off.➽Madoc- Madoc was the character that probably made me cry the most throughout this entire series. Loving people can be so very hard, and each journey is so very different, but Madoc just really amplifies these statements and it hurts (in the best way possible) to read. The parallels between him and Jude, both truly born in blood, and seeing the different paths they take to fight each other, while always loving each other, it’s really something that I don’t have words for, but it is truly heartbreakingly beautiful.➽Locke- Wow, he actually did die and Taryn actually did kill him. The biggest bamboozle of the entire book, and please call me boo boo the fool from now on while I apply my clown makeup.Okay, let’s talk about some of the big things in this book while we are in this spoiler section, too. Let’s just get the snake out of the bag (end me). You know, with all the buzz about the 2019 YA book snake, I really didn’t expect for Cardan to turn into her. Wow, truly wow. I love a good fairytale twist in my fae stories, and it was truly one worthy of ballads. Seeing Jude realize that she would rather not have Cardan than only being able to have him controlled? I will be forever crying. So beautiful. Also, the sword she did it with? Truly forever crying.I will forever and always be so surprised that Locke was not the big bad of this series and honestly? He deserved a better death and storyline ender. Like, I couldn’t believe Madoc was truly the endgame villain. This book was still so perfect to me, but this was what truly let me down the most. I wanted a satisfying Locke death and a true villain story, but it felt bad that we didn’t get that.“Tell me what I must slay, what I must steal, tell me the riddle I must solve or the hag I must trick. Only tell me the way, and I will do it, no matter the danger, no matter the hardship, no matter the cost.”I also didn’t love how Cardan told everyone that him and Jude got married. I mean, trust me, I screamed and rolled around in my bed like I was thirteen, but I still wanted something more. Also, the exiled scheme he made up? Baby, that’s not it. But whatever, because when he told her that he loved her it was truly the best thing my eyes have ever read for all of 2019 and you won’t hear me complaining. Truly OTP status worthy and the best enemies to lovers I will probably ever read.I’ve had a few people tell me that they thought I’d find the ending a bit cheesy (no, this isn’t a pizza dad joke), and that’s valid, because it is a bit cheesy. But I just love these characters so much and they deserve so much happiness that I just felt really blessed to be able to experience that with them for an epilogue. Also, I have really high hopes for what is to come with Oak, because there is no way that Holly Black set that up to not masterfully tell what is to come for Faerie.I will also be honest and say that this was probably my least favorite in the series. Also, these books are always split up in two parts (or books), and the first half of this was six star worthy. Truly better than anything I’ve read this entire year. It was the last half (and cheesy epilogue) that didn’t quite live up to my expectations. But again, this series just means so much to me and it truly feels once in a lifetime to me.Overall, I just believe this is the series of my heart. Holly Black and her fae stories have truly shaped me into the reader and reviewer I am today. I owe her so much, and this concluding novel just felt like lifeblood to me. No other book has made me as happy reading. No other book has had me spam refreshing my kindle app to make sure it downloads. No other book has ever been more my brand. And I’m not sure if any book series ever will. It is a truly honor to read and review this book, and it’s more of an honor that some people correlate it with me. I know that no amount of words that I string together will ever adequately do justice to how much these books mean to me, but I promise to shout about them forever, and keep them in my heart always. And I hope that every reader has a series that makes them feel the wayThe Folk of the Airhas made me feel.Youtube|Blog|Instagram|Twitter|Tumblr|TwitchContent and Trigger Warnings:death, murder, war themes, gore, blood depiction, talk of cannibalism, and torture.Bonus – Park Jimin, forever and always my Cardan.

The Cruel Prince,"Once upon a time, a wicked girl with a cold, cold heart traipsed through a forest so light and stark. Trees of clean bark. Branches dangling with folk art.And it was thus she came upon a hole so, so dark.Our restless little devil looked through the hole and glimpsed trees of bark covered in blood, branches twisted and falling with a thud, screams coming out of the mud that had seen much brutal flood.So the girl backed up, and ran, and jumped.I fell into theHolly Blackhole for fun so dark.And now, it seems, I am stuck.Oops.“Nice things don’t happen in storybooks,” Taryn says. “Or when they do happen, something bad happens next. Because otherwise the story would be boring, and no one would read it.”Before picking upThe Cruel PrinceI, of course, had expectations. No, scratch that, I didn’t have expectations, I never do, never dare hope—I usually try to not expect much of a book so I wouldn't be disappointed—what I had was simply assumptions about how it was gonna be. And I was completely and utterly wrong.People make this seem like a romance-oriented book; it is not.This book is less about the romance (which only starts to show itself a little by the end) and more about games, intrigue and, most importantly, the characters. It’s about anger. Betrayal. Revenge. Secrets and, above all, power. This is the dangerous tale of a human girl who grew up in faerieland and has endured much cruelty and pain, is bullied at school, because of being mortal and weak.She will show you she is not.Let no one call Jude Duarteweak.That’s what comes of hungering for something: You forget to check if it’s rotten before you gobble it down.She will be the human who looks at all that faeries have, acknowledges that she, as a human, is unworthy of those things, still wants them anyways, and thus takes them. Faeries might always be better than her, but she can be much, much worse. It should not surprise you that I adore her, then.The Cruel Princeis a cruel, enchanting tale of a cruel, enchanting people in a cruel, enchanting world. And all that I said are the reasons why I will love it forever. With you, to the ends of time.As always, you can check out my chosen soundtrack for the series at the end of the review—I went slightly wild there and made a mash up of the three books’ covers to create one for my playlist.The odd thing about ambition is this: You can acquire it like a fever, but it is not so easy to shed.CW➾ abuse, bullying, drugging, speciesism (faeries over humans rather than humans over animals), self harm✧ Storyline ✧One ordinary night a not so ordinary man drops from the sky into an ordinary human neighborhood riding a not so ordinary horse. He dismounts and walks up to one of the many ordinary houses and, raising his not so ordinary fist, he knocks.The night is no longer ordinary.For inside the house, three little girls watch TV and eat fish sticks with ketchup. For one bears half-faerie blood, while the pair of full human twins do not. For an scared woman comes running from the kitchen and the man calls her wife and traitor. For he kills her and takes the three little girls to faerieland. For in Faerie, there are no fish sticks, no ketchup, and no television.“Because you’re like a story that hasn’t happened yet. Because I want to see what you will do. I want to be part of the unfolding of the tale.”What there is in Fearie is a court ruled by the High King, presiding over the three factions of the Seelie Court, the Unseelie court, and the wild fey. And that king has a general—a faerie whose wife left him pregnant with his heir, a faerie who slaughtered a family one not so ordinary night and took three human girls.Jude is the youngest of the three, the younger twin, and she wants nothing more than to belong, craves nothing more than being knighted and a permanent part of the court. Even if most of the faeries hate humans; even if she is bullied at school by the youngest prince and his gang; even if she is belittled and bloodied and nearly killed.So it should come as a surprise to no one that she would lie and spy and become a vengeful murderess who changes the game. It does anyways.“I am tired of caring,” I say. “Why should I?”“Because they could kill you!”“They better,” I say to her. “Because anything less than that isn’t going to work.”✧ Storytelling ✧Shame on you, Mary, for waiting so long to pick up a masterpiece ofHolly Black’s.A tale so well told. A twisted fairytale so mesmerising. An atmosphere so immersive and pulsing. An eye for detail and consideration and clever themes and additions. A hand wielding words and metaphors as a master swordsman would a sword.I read my first Black book and did not look back.“I’ve seen many impossible things. I have seen the acorn before the oak. I have seen the spark before the flame. But never have I seen such as this: A dead woman living. A child born from nothing.”✧ Characters ✧★Jude:Call her a wrecking ball if you want, call her an annoying bitch if you dare, I would only say you don’t comprehend the joy of jumping into the canyon of anger, the peace in throwing rules and caution into the wind, the freedom in crossing the line and embracing the glorious beauty of revenge. “It’s the thrill of leaping without being able to see the ground below you, right before you realize that’s called falling.” I would say that you’ve never known the colours. I would say you are blind.She is a prideful, unyielding fighter who hates being vulnerable, being controlled. She is a vengeful, violent liar who adores power, adores attention.She is angry and dark and probably needs to see a therapist but, if you told her so, would most likely tell you to go eff yo self and that she can manage herself quite nicely thank you very much.And if you think she’s starting to sound like me...then whatever do you mean *smiles sweetly*“If you hurt me, I wouldn’t cry. I would hurt you back.”I’d heardcriticism of Jude’s reaction to the trauma of her childhoodand agreed with it for the beginning chapters, but then I realised that it’s merely that she handles the trauma differently.What Jude does is escape thinking about what happened, flee her feelings and fear; and it naturally results in her becoming out of touch with her emotions. She endures and pushes it into the back of her brain due to not knowing another way to cope and that’s the way that comes naturally to her. She is always afraid, always on alert, so she’s grown numb and used to it, so she’s turned tired and angry, so she lashes out.In fact, her mental state is captured accurately, because our personality shapes our response to trauma the same way trauma shapes our personality.She doesn’t have nightmares not because her trauma has been ignored, but because she can’t calm her nerves enough to even sleep.Before, I never knew how far I would go. Now I believe I have the answer. I will go as far as there is to go. I will go way too far.And if you put that kind of personality under pressure, it acts much like an elastic object: springing upon release, going wild and hitting everything at close range. She was raised in a house of butchery by a man who delights in war and death and conflict. And because such a man was her father and such a man killed her father, this is the birth of a murderer. Her composed smiles coming unraveled, coming undone.“I thought I was supposed to be good and follow the rules. But I am done with being weak. I am done with being good. I think I am going to be something else.”★Cardan:A few months ago a friend of mine forced me to watch the kdramaBoys Over Flowersin exchange for me asking her to watch the BBCSherlock; the deal was that we’d each watch 6 episodes of our respective shows and stop after that if we’re no longer interested. I, ofc, stopped after 6 because I just can’t connect with kdaramas. But I’m glad I watched those episodes, because I can now write this:Cardan Greenbriar is literally and thoroughly Gu Jun-pyo fromBoys Over Flowers.But where I only found Jun-pyo entertaining, IloveCardan, probably because of Jude’s difference from the female lead of the show. With Jun-pyo it was just a petulant boyo lashing out and being angry and bullying and abusing a powerless girl (who still got back at him impressively but still, their personalities where the opposites) while with Cardanit’s a sparring match.I called him “a simple old-school bully” the very first time we were introduced, and I was both right and wrong. Right because he is an old-school bully, yet wrong because he is not simply so but playfully; Cardan is a clever cruel prince, an angry spoiled/abused child, and a charming adorable coward. Too young, too weak, too mean, too precious! But not ambitious, not like Jude.I blame you guys for being disappointed at first; it was unfair to feel annoyed that he couldn’t fill the shoes I’d thought Holly Black was intending for him when shewasn’tintending those shoes for him. He has his own shiny shoes to stand in and THANK GOD.“There’s safety in being awful.”✯Locke:First character who intrigued me with his bored, manipulative ways. I spent a long time just repeatingwhat’s his game what’s his gamein my notes, I swear, and I find it rather perfect that his game is just that—a game. This drama-loving fox is one I simultaneously want to kiss and kill and absolutely cannot get enough of.✯Taryn:Jude’s twin sister is much like her while still being the opposite. She, too, wants to belong and would do anything to achieve it; she, too, can be cold and manipulative as the faeries and craves their exotic danger, growing used to recognising bad things as good; and she, too, has had to become something else to survive, something not so human. But where Jude is wildfire, she is ice; one is raging, the other composed. Both burn you in the end.“Desire is an odd thing. As soon as it’s sated, it transmutes. If we receive golden thread, we desire the golden needle.”☆ Those aren’t the only ones that made an impact:Madocwith his anger issues and twisted love,Viviwith her raging selfish heart that encourages the same trait in others,Orianawho is way more than she seems. All layered, none all-evil, being a mix of cruel and gentle. I heard someone say this book has an all-Slytherin cast, and I’m inclined to agree—no wonder I enjoy them all so much.✧ Relationships ✧“Like taking a dare to run over knives, like an adrenaline strike of lightning, like the moment when you’ve swum too far out in the sea and there is no going back, only cold black water closing over your head.❥Romance:Can I just say Chapter 25 & 26? BECAUSE CHAPTER 25 & 26! To be frank with you, I wasn’t sure at first about these two as I had my doubts regarding Cardan being someone who could possibly match Jude in strength, but I now adore them because I realised the nature of dynamic is a game wheresheis the one with the power (while being terrified of him ever having any power) and he is drawn to that. He likes to challenge her, question her,tryto best her, while actually delighting in her holding a dagger at his throat.They spar; they fight; they have (more or less) the same personality, liars and deceivers and and power-oriented people.Their only difference is that he’s a pleasure-seeking coward where she’s a purposeful warrior, and that somehow makes them an even better match.“He’s flint, you’re tinder.”❥Familial Bonds:I’ve already talked too much so I’ll just say that the sisterhood, brother-sister bond, father-daughter relationship...all are written tangibly, conveying the complicated and contradictory feelings that come with being a family (and one so messed up as this) quite perfectly. It was a gem to read.✧ Worldbuilding ✧Faerie might be beautiful, but its beauty is like a golden stag’s carcass, crawling with maggots beneath his hide, ready to burst.This land of beautiful nightmares, these creatures of twilight and glamours, these clawed hands bearing nevermore and faerie fruit with their superstitious-like practices (e.g. having a necklace of dried rowan berries or wearing your stockings inside out) that are not simply superstitions, all serve to exceptionally bring this world into life and prove that world building is, indeed, Holly Black’s ultimate strength.In the end, readingThe Cruel Princewith its mythical magic and all the cruelties, deceptions, and (hypocritical) prejudice of its people, feels like wandering through a fairytale that chose the path on its left somewhere down the road, refusing to go right. And you bet I always choose the path on my left as well.✧ Companions ✧Book series playlist:Spotify URLBooks in series:➳ The Cruel Prince (The Folk of the Air, #1) ★★★★★➳The Lost Sisters(The Folk of the Air, #1.5) ★★★★☆➳The Wicked King(The Folk of the Air, #2) ★★★★★➳The Queen of Nothing(The Folk of the Air, #3) ★★★★☆➳How the King of Elfhame Learned to Hate Stories(The Folk of the Air, #3.5) ☆☆☆☆☆",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26032825-the-cruel-prince,The Cruel Prince.txt
The Battle of the Labyrinth,"“Be careful of love. It'll twist your brain around and leave you thinking up is down and right is wrong.”Well, isn’t that the truth?The Battle of Labyrinthis, so far, the most disappointed installment for this series, and very much less exciting than the previous books.As much as I hate to say it, the ship of Percabeth is drowning in this installment instead of sailing.One reason I can’t get behind the Percabeth ship here is because of Annabeth’s continuous but hidden feelings for Luke. Say what you want to say, but she doesn’t shut up about him. You expect me to believe Percabeth is a thing when she’s jealous over Rachel and Percy’s friendshipyetshe clearly isn’t over Luke? I don’t think so. It doesn’t even matter if they aren’t romantic feelings anymore. Even Thalia was able to tell Luke was long gone and gave up on him rather quickly. I liked her attitude on that, because she knew she wasn’t responsible for “saving” someone who didn’t even want it. If Luke was written differently, in a way where we, as the readers, could see he wants help, or has hope to leave the Titan’s and Kronos, I would accept Annabeth’s concern over him. However, even if I don’t hate Luke (shoutout to Rick for that), I cannot bring myself to sympathize with her either. While the previous book showed the future potential for these two, this one officially killed it.While I love Annabeth in the first three books, she frustrated me a lot here. She came across more rude, unwilling to think about how others feel. I despised her attitude towards Rachel, even if I can understand where she was coming from. Some may argue it’s because she was jealous of Rachel and Percy, and while this makes sense, I can’t move on from it due to the reality of how Percy feels.As readers, it’s obvious to see Annabeth has feelings for Percy, but as an outsider’s perspective, if we take Percy into consideration and how he feels, he clearly hasn’t noticed. Honestly, I believe even Percy doesn’t know who he likes and how he feels. He’s shownsomethingfor others like Calypso, and he’s not exactly distancing himself from Rachel, but he doesn’t make himself stand out. He’s a high school freshman now, but as Rachel said, he’s a dude, and he’s blind. Still, in my opinion, he doesn’t give any signals about how he feels, only small things we can interpret. Therefore, Annabeth’s jealousy towards Rachel felt unprovoked, unnecessary and for no good measure. I wanna say it’s childish, but since they are kids, I guess it makes sense. Regardless, I would appreciate this future couple more had Annabeth not been so mixed with her feelings, with her obvious attraction to Percy becoming more obvious but her care and defense for Luke still overcoming it. I’m not reading this series for this couple, especially as it’s still a middle grade novel (though I’d argue it’s more YA now with the kids being in high school), so the romance is not the biggest point here. Still, when everyone who loves this series mentions the two of them together, I would have expected to be feeling the same. Sadly, I couldn’t bring myself to root for them, for their future stories and moments, when Annabeth’s attitude feels rash, completely thoughtless.“What is it with you?” I snapped. “Why do you keep defending him?”Dear Percy, I wanna know that too.Plus, Annabeth’s personality here felt so different than the previous books. Whereas before I thought she was incredibly strong, adventurous, and courageous, here she felt not only rude, but also obnoxious. For as strong as she was before, now her diligence was just concealed. She just feels whiny now, complaining about Luke, and defending Luke all the time. They share a past and history together, so it’s easy to understand how and why Annabeth feels protective over Luke. Regardless, there’s no character development or any type of hint showing character development. There’s no implication that Annabeth is growing from her previous feelings, whether romantic, platonic, or admirable. This will all come down to how one interprets Annabeth’s feelings. Some may see it as her still seeing Luke as her hero, while others, like me, will still see it as something more. Regardless, even if I saw Annabeth as seeing Luke as someone she still looks up to, I still don’t think there has been any character development on her end. I would believe it more had she shown any type of remorse for how shehasbeen feeling. In my opinion, it felt like her entire arc revolves around stating Luke is being manipulated, Luke this, Luke that.So much for being the wise girl, huh? After four books, this is simply disappointing.Also, I feel as if this was the book with the least fitting title. I mean, we still learn about the Labyrinth, but I guess what I’m trying to say is that I expected MORE of thebattleof Labyrinth. I’ve been really excited to see how Percy becomes stronger throughout the books. We don’t really see him training and improving, so it’s safe to say it happens outside the book, which means we don’t read about it all the time. Because of this happening off-page, I have been looking forward to seeing Percy fight more, grow stronger, and show us his potential more. I do think the author’s timeline is working out perfectly well. I don’t think it’s progressing too slow or too fast, and the development of everything happening feels right. Yet, I can’t help but be disappointed with the lack of…powers? Magic? We see more of Percy’s potential here, which is super exciting to finally see, and something we can say we have been waiting for. On the other hand, it has been three years since we met Percy and he joined the camp, yet not much new has happened in regards to who he is, his potential, and what he can do. This had the most fighting and action of the series thus far. While it was nice, it wasn’t the most exciting. I would have expected more resolution to be done. At this point, I can only say there are scenes that feel repetitive concerning who he is as a half-blood.I also thought the entire execution of Pan was underwhelming, as if the entire journey of finding him was not as important. I was happy for Grover, and then I was disappointed. I think it’s fair to say I was expecting a better execution, more performance to show its relevance. This also had some similarity to book 2,The Sea of Monsters, where, once again, the characters felt off in who they are. I can confidently sayThe Sea of Monstersstill provided that laughter and humor this series was looking promising to have. This fourth installment was simply so dull compared to its predecessors. Even with all the fights, action, twists and turns, disappointment makes me too bitter.With that being said, I still think there are praise worthy moments in this book. I’ve loved seeing the new gods we meet through the story, both good and bad, and how they have relevance to Percy and his journey. I’ve loved seeing how Percy becomes more acquainted with those closest to him as well. Grover, though, has shown fantastic character development. I’m looking forward to seeing how his powers evolve. I especially loved that we got more of Tyson here and how he became an important part of Percy’s gang. Seeing him tag along made the journey all the better. Special shoutout to Mrs. O’Leary. I always have a soft spot for animal characters in books, and Mrs. O’Leary being a huge hellhound makes no difference. I’m glad Quintus left her with Percy instead of getting rid of her. It warms my heart knowing she is in good hands. Dionysus, God of Wine, has greatly grown on me. He’s unintentionally hilarious. I wish he had more page-time because his banter created some of that humor and joy missing. I also loved Calypso, even though I feel so bad for her. And of course, Nico, my precious, misunderstood emo baby. I am so excited to learn more about him throughout the series.As mentioned before, I do think the author has written the stories progression really well, timeline wise. The way everything is happening, from the Titan’s army forming and attacking, to how Kronos is being reformed, to how Percy and everyone else are gathering allies and continue learning more about the prophecy; it all comes into a well-done conclusion. Once again, I am a fan of this author’s writing. The way he writes in vivid detail, explaining the monsters and gods is very imaginary. It’s easy to see the descriptions come to life. And even though I was disappointed with Percy’s character arc, I do like seeing more action being done here. I don’t doubt the last and final book,The Last Olympian, will end in a satisfying enough conclusion.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8130423-the-battle-of-the-labyrinth,The Battle of the Labyrinth.txt
The Golden Compass,"“After nourishment, shelter and companionship, stories are the thing we need most in the world.”― Philip PullmanI tried reading Northern Lights as a child when it was enthusiastically recommended to me by librarian knowing I adore fantasy, but I didn't connect to it then and I can't remember ever finishing the trilogy. As an adult in stressful times looking for a comforting winter fantasy read, I decided to revisit this classic of the genre, and this time I liked it immensely, so much it got me out of my reading slump. This is a book that reminds you why you love reading. Pullman is a tremendously talented writer and storyteller. The flow and plot of the novel are unique, creative, and massively engaging. There is not one moment of boredom in the whole novel, it is action-packed, but most thoughtfully, creating one magical story, one that you cannot easily forget.This book also got me interested in Philip Pullman as a person, as well as his worldview, philosophy and perspective on spirituality and religion. What we see in this novel is an inversion of moral values. The Church is very important in the world of Dark Materials, it is the force that controls society and patrols the matter of reason, science, and development, in a really negative way. Science is also painted as negative, the discipline that makes innocent suffer in order to achieve progress. Religion and science do not have good connotations, and the true morals and correct way of being have to be discovered and found by and in individuals. Our protagonist Lyra, is opposing the overruling forces of society, assisted by outlaws on the margins of society as Iorek, witches and sailors Gyptians. The book grapples with many profound questions and the intricate relationship of philosophy, science and religion. It criticizes authoritarianism, and religious authority, which leaves little room for dissent or pluralism of views, and diminishes the freedom of the individual to discover personal and unique standpoint. Lyra's parents are also villains, and the positive foundation, usually found in the figures of authority (kings, priests, headmasters and parents) is absent. It is evident that Pullman has strong distrust in the figures of authority, at least ones that don’t allow any scope for argument or dissent.Without any solid foundations, trust, or stability of authority figures, our protagonist is not able to create the inner compass of detecting right or wrong, the conscience or the superego, as everybody who ought to be good in her world is deceptive, and those who ought to be evil are good. The moral inversion is present - the evil does not come from outside, from monsters, but from the inside, society and figures of authority, those who claim to be righteous, and the help and salvation come from the outside, ones that are found the be useless or undesirable by the majority. Lyra, therefore, has a magical compass - an extension of ego, an item representing only stability, that helps her to find the right perspective, the truth that is so hard to grasp in this confusing world. Lyra's special power is to see value in things and those who seem to be invaluable, and also, to expose the deceitfulness of those who claim to be good, but are evil, being a trickster character, driven by curiosity and critical intelligence.The concept of dæmon is also brilliant. Dæmons are animals that are an external physical manifestation of a person's ""inner-self"", with changing appearance in children and fixed appearance in adults, a brilliant literary tool for exploring characters naturally within the text. Animals that help and follow their hero companions are an ancient concept seen in myths and fairy tales. Animals often solve quests that heroes are not capable of resolving themselves, representing the primitive instincts, animal urges and primal energy of the psyche put in the useful concrete function. Also, the choice of words for these accompanying animals in Pullman world is interesting and was off-putting for me as a child, obviously alluding to the word demon that usually has a negative connotation of spiritual destructive evil forces, but here represents the person soul. In the name Pullman is consistent with his moral inversion that is present thorough his world-building. Similarly, the word Gyptians also alludes to Gypsies, folk that often symbolically represents human shadow in stories, people in which civilized society projects the repressed traits. Gyptians are outcasts and the positive figures that enable Lyra to progress in her quest. Also, Lyra, in order to succeed, has to use lies, distort reality, and even use truth as a deception to reach the goals, not a usual thing for heroin to use for victory, as these traits are usually utilised by villains. Determinism and free will are also touched upon interestingly, as Lyra has a fixed destiny, that can only be achieved if she is not aware of it, and thinks she is making free choices.“We are all subject to the fates. But we must act as if we are not, or die of despair.”Pullman critiqued Tokien's and C.S. Lewis's works, oftentimes unjustly, due to their Christian beliefs that left more or less subtle marks on their world and characters. They are my favorite writers, one of the most influential ones in my reading life, and I like the classical fantasy story of a hero fighting dark forces and monsters, one where the good and evil are much more split and well defined, put in the more predictable categories than in Pullman world. I think that a fantasy writer's worldview has a massive impact on the kind of world he is creating. For instance, I could not connect to R.R. Martin's writing, because I could not find a sense of meaning in his storylines, his world being saturated with nihilism and random suffering, without a clear vision or moral lesson, or a metaphor of psychological development that more classic hero story has, all things I quite like in fantasy genre. For exploring absurdism and nihilism I prefer literary fiction and stories put in reality, not in the imaginative world. But with years I found I like morally gray characters as in Abercrombie's writing and made space for the imaginative world of unordinary Pullman. Pullman is not a king of nihilism, but fantasy moral inversion as good and evil in his world are unpredictable and unordinary, as they oftentimes in life are. It is often said that he created an atheistic world, but I think that is a far too simplistic way of thinking. R.R.Martin created atheistic, but Pullman created a gnostic world, and some call Dark Materials as a retelling of Milton's Paradise Lost. Pullman beliefs in multiple worlds and spiritual realms, not a binary good and evil model. Pullman is passionate to reinvent and redefine, asking provocative questions and exposing hypocrisy, the trickster of the fantasy genre.The classical white and black world is maybe more suitable to the child due to the fact that children are not completely able to integrate good and evil traits into one object, so the negative traits of mothers are more easily comprehended expressed in evil witches or a dragon. But, adults should be aware that a fixed unexamined worldview of good and evil figures is harmful and that oftentimes the things are not as they seem. In Nietzsche's notion, in adulthood, a person is called to reexamine and discard the integrated false and destructive beliefs of their parents, authority figures, and society, the ones that are a threat to integrity, authenticity and individuality, that were advertised as useful and good. And that is why I salute Pullman, this intelligent genre provocateur that exposes what happens when people dogmatically follow abstractions.That being said, the person has to be smart in the process and not discard the parts of tradition and integrated beliefs that are useful and valuable. That is my only critique of Pullman, that he could become far more reductionistic and discard something as complex as human religion or authoritative figures and characterize them as completely wrong. There is a phase in psychotherapy when a person becomes aware of the negative traits of their parents and completely demonizes them. But, that is only a stop in the journey, not a destination. As always, maturity lies in tolerating the ambiguity of one object, being aware of its both good and bad traits, discarding the bad, and keeping the good. There lies a profound balance of life.“We don’t need a list of rights and wrongs, tables of dos and don’ts: we need books, time, and silence. Thou shalt not is soon forgotten, but Once upon a time lasts forever.”― Philip Pullman",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119322.The_Golden_Compass,The Golden Compass.txt
Fracture Me,"This novella for me is a revelation. It’s also a foreshadowing. It surprises me both in good and sad way. I’m very much vocal of my adoration towards Warner but I don’t have that much hate on Adam. I liked him just fine. The reason why I don’t prefer him is that he’s sort of bland. He doesn’t have much character and something’s telling me that he wasn’t the right guy for Juliette. ThenDestroy MeandUnravel Mecame that showed things that support my theory. ButFracture Me, ironically, which was told from Adam’s POV cemented it even more. I never would have guessed how fragile his feelings for Juliette were. I can’t even compare it to how he feels for James. Because if there’s only one person he needs to save, and between his little brother and woman she claimed he loved, I’m pretty sure, he—without a doubt—will save James. Don’t get me wrong, I admired his love for his brother but it just shows that she’s not his priority. He can even abandon her safety as long as the welfare of his brother is secured.(I think Adam earned some positive merit from me. He loves his brother and they have each other longer than he had Juliette. Of course, it is understandable that he wants his only family safety first. That doesn’t make his love for Juliette any less than what he really had for her. That’s actually the real question here: how much did he love her from the very start?)He doesn’t have a real inkling on what’s going on her mind. He doesn’t completely understand her and that’s why I think before that their relationship wouldn’t work. But what make it so unbearably sad is what Adam really thought of her—a weakling. I don’t entirely think of his words as insult (although it does sound kinda like it) but to describe a person in such negative context made me question his already questionable intentions. What he thought of her is the EXACT opposite of what Warner thinks of Juliette. He always pushes her forward, to embrace her potential, to make her understand that she is indeed strong. Whereas Adam wanted to baby Juliette, he even thinks that she’s going to weigh them down. I didn’t expect him to feel that way for Juliette, but it is without a shadow of doubt, true.In fact, I even saw more sincerity on Kenji. He was the one who was hell-bent on saving Juliette. He even blamed himself to what has happened. He’s the one reminding Adam that he should be worried, but no, he wanted to seize the momentarily peace they have and not stifle James safety unnecessarily. Now, tell me why should Juliette end up with Adam? Because I don’t see a single thing that will save his face with this revelation. Not even with the things he did in the first two books.It’s foreshadowing, that I can tell you. I don’t even need an image of Warner kissing Juliette (although will greatly appreciate) shoved to my face to know that they will be the end game. This novella pretty much solidified that. I have so much to say about their relationship but I’m saving it on my manifesto I’m writing for them (for myProject Sixty-Twoentry). But this novella definitely gave me the assurance I need.The story was bit shorter. It did bridge the gap between book 2 and 3. It wasn’t as personal asDestroy Me, and the one significant thing I learned from Adam is that he loves his brother so much. But also we got to know how things had happened prior to the opening chapter ofIgnite Me. And by the looks of it, it promises amazing things to come. Yes, Juliette, remove those gloves, and go all out. I’m ending this review with my favorite quote fromIgnite Me:“If there were even the slightest chance I could spare you this pain,”he finally says, “I would’ve taken it. You must know I wouldn’t have said it if it weren’t absolutely true.” — WarnerI’m so,soready. I’m impatiently waiting here, and I have the feeling the wait will definitely pay off.4.5/5See original post here @Aeropapers****Post-Reading Comment:Let me clarify my rating first.This doesn’t have anything to do with Adam. And from the looks of it, it just cemented the reason why Warner and Juliette should be together. Actually, it solidify the end game here. Their understanding of the girl is contrasting, like night and day. It also showed who Adam main priority is; in a way told us who the most important person in his life is. And it ain't Juliette (not even himself). I was really surprised on how things went down in here. I didn’t expect Adam to be this callous and violent than necessary, or from what I know of him.I have tons to say but let me process all these thoughts in my head properly(it's wee hours of the night here). Adam gave me something to think about. Expect a lengthy review later.****See, I care for you Adam. I even changed the title, added the synopsis of your novella, and I even uploaded the cover. (11/03) Why so broken Adam? ;)****Adam fans, this one's for all of you! ;) I'll still be reading you though. Don't worry. ;)Is it too much to ask for another Warner Novella? Is it? *bribes mafi with cakes & cookies*I'm just gonna sit here patiently and wait for Ignite Me! Warneeeer!!!",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17331518-fracture-me,Fracture Me.txt
Destroy Me,"Warning: Do not read if you didn't read ""Shatter Me"" and don't want to be spoiled?! *lol*I'm not quite sure if an additional short story to a series can really spoil you, but I thought I might warn you just in case! ;-PBut then again the only people who will read this will be people who loved the series so umm.... We're good?! *lol*Anywayyyyyyy!First of all: I already liked Warner in “Shatter me” and to read his POV in “Destroy me” only caused me to love him even more! XDIL.O.V.E.Warner and I want to hug him and heal his broken heart! Gosh! That poor boy! That lovely ruined and lonely little thing! To read what he thinks, what he feels and to know that Juliette’s written words and actions destroyed him… It was just too much to bear! T_TI hated to read how much he struggled and how broken he truly is and I really really really hope that Juliette will give him a chance to win her heart. >_< His love for her is so intense that it actually hurt and I don’t even know how he’s able to get up each and every day. I mean, hell she shot him and considering his feelings this must have hurt at least as much as the wound! =(Well anyway! I liked his relationship with Delalieu and I hated his father! With a fierce passion! *grrr*That scene where he almost choked his own son? Gosh how much I despise him!Can anyone get rid of this man in the next few books? *hires Celaena*Since I’m a sucker for quotes I’m going to end this review with the ones I liked the most:The things I said to her.A tight breath.The way I touched her.My jaw tenses.If it were nothing but sexual attraction I’m sure I would not suffer such unbearable humiliation. But I wanted so much more than her body.Yesh, you wanted to love her and she shot you! Dang it! T_T“I drop the bread back onto my plate. “My opinions,” I say to him, quietly this time, “should not so easily break your own. Stand by your convictions. Form clear and logical arguments. Even if I disagree.”I adored him for that sentence alone! XD“His hand closes around my throat.The movement is so rough and violent I’m almost relieved. Some part of me always hopes he’ll go through with it; that maybe this time he’ll actually let me die. But he never does. It never lasts.Torture is not torture when there’s any hope of relief.”That moment killed me, I swear! >_<“I did not bring her on base to exploit her ability. And I certainly did not expect to fall for her in the process.But these truths and my real motivations will be buried with me.”Jeez! Hopefully not!!!“A look into her mind.And though the anticipation is killing me, I’m also acutely aware of just how badly this might backfire. I’m suddenly not sure I ever want to know. And yet I do. I definitely do.”Warner is so torn it’s almost painful! XD“On the battlefield, I’m able to disconnect myself from the motions I’ve been taught to memorize. I’ve developed a reputation as a cold, unfeeling monster wo fears nothing and cares for less.But this is all very deceiving.Because the truth is, I am nothing but a coward.”You’re brave Warner! So brave! Don’t let anyone tell you any different!!!“But there are some things I do not forgive.I don’t consider myself a moral man. I do not philosophize about life or bother with the laws and principles that govern most people. I do not pretend to know the difference between right and wrong. But I do live by a certain kind of code. And sometimes, I think, you have to learn how to shoot first.”It was so sad that all his efforts had been in vain, but he’s trying to be a good person and that counts for something! =)“Love is a heartless bastard.I’m driving myself insane.”Warner you truly destroyed me… in the best possible way!And with that sentencemy review actually ends! ;-)",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13623150-destroy-me,Destroy Me.txt
Renegades,"Guys, I don’t know myself anymore.I’m currently sitting here eating baby carrots, and I’m not happy about it, which is characteristic, but the sheer fact that I’m ingesting a vegetable in the first place is astounding. I’m currently addicted to watching feature-length episodes of a British quiz show on YouTube, when up until two days ago I was convinced I was racist against British people. But most importantly (and actually, you know, semi-relevantly) I don’t know how I feel about Marissa Meyer.https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...She used to be my Favorite Author!!! (Capitals and excessive exclamation points for both emphasis and flair.) Or I used to say she was. Because I also used to say that the Lunar Chronicles were my favorite series, before I realized that was patently false.But now there’s a whole lot going on.I do remember loving all of theLunar Chroniclesbooks exceptCinder, which was meh. Well, andFairestwas pretty bad. Okay andWires and Nervewas also bad. But anyway, I read most of them in 2015 and 2015 me, as has been stated many a time on this account, canNOT be trusted. Example of an opinion I held in 2015, for proof: “I should wear full makeup, including eyeliner, to school every day. Even though school starts at 7:35 a.m. Even though I could sleep for at least 14 more minutes if I, you know, didn’t do that.”See the level of illogical we’re working with when we reflect on 2015?Anyway. But it gets worse, because I hated the bookHeartlesswith everything in me. Which caught me off guard, because that was in very early 2017 and I hadn’t realized past me’s lack of reliability yet.The point of all of this is that I approached this book with trepidation. And now I am approaching this review with trepidation, because I DON’T KNOW HOW I FEEL!!Yes, I am claiming to be “approaching” this review even as I am clearly an excessive number of words into it. What of it?Let’s divide this into two very broad categories. Bad news first.THE BADI am currently taking a class called “The Art of Fiction,” and it has threatened to single-handedly absolutely full-on ruin reading one hundred percent of YA fantasy for me. Just in time for me to be in the hugest fantasy mood of my life!! Ideal. Life is filled with these perfect symmetries, etc.Anyway. In that course, we read a couple of stories by Anton Chekhov, and Chekhov’s got this quote, maybe, which may or may not go something like this: “If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off. If it's not going to be fired, it shouldn't be hanging there.” This is a very great quote to ponder as a writer, but as a reader it sucks SO BAD.No twist is a twist anymore. I see everything coming. I am now prescient and it is a goddamn curse.Basically what I’m saying is that I saw a twist in this book coming and I blame Chekhov.My more major, less literary complaint: the pacing of this is extremely strange. I think that has a lot to do with the fact that this book is FIVE HUNDRED PAGES LONG!! Can you imagine being bold enough to make thefirst bookin your trilogy five hundred pages long?? Who besides Marissa Meyer has the clout to pull that type of sh*t off.But anyway. As the old saying goes, just because Marissa Meyer can doesn’t mean Marissa Meyer should. There is just no reason this book had to be 500 pages long. One, because that’s too long for almost any book, but two, because this book was doing absolutely nothing good with all of those pages.First off, I finished this book and was like, “Ah! A whole lot of nothing.” It truly feels like there is absolutely zero plotline to this book. There are a few separate events with very little tying them together, and definitely no tension or suspense of any kind. The last hundred pages especially were like Dry City, USA. (Dry meaning boring. Not as in “not wet.” Hopefully all pages are Dry City, USA in that sense.)The second pacing thing: this felt like 1.5 books. I can pick an exact moment around 350 pages in that felt like a perfect stopping point, but this bad boy just...trucks on. And not only does that 350 page mark feel like a perfect ending, the actual ending (150 pages or so later) feels like the exact middle point of a book.The ending was so, so, so weird and so, so, so rushed. I’m going to say what happened that was very strange in vague terms, so hopefully I won’t spoil anything, but if you haven’t read the book just skip this paragraph maybe. Okay so basically, one character has a near-death experience and we are expected to believe this character died. However, this character did NOT die. Character tricked us and other characters! That is just so classic this character. Anyway, character pops up, alive and well, andno explanation is ever given for how this character didn’t die.We just move on!Sloppy, sloppy. I’m honestly very glad I have the ARC of Archenemies. not because this is so good that I’m like, let me get my hands on that sequel, but more because this feels aggressively unfinished.In terms of characters: I feel pretty meh about all of them. There were some that have potential (more on that later), but a few were so devastatingly devoid of personality that a side-by-side comparison between them and a sleeve of saltines would make the crackers seem like a day trip to Flavortown. (Guy Fieri reference: Check.)Finally, this book often just felt like...nothing special. Superheroes have been done. Slow burn romances and banter and fight scenes every hundred pages and halfhearted twists have been done. At a lot of moments this just felt like every entry into the superhero genre tossed in a blender with every YA fantasy of the last five years.And that’s really lame.Luckily, we left the good stuff to cheer ourselves up!!THE GOODEven though this was unoriginal, it still managed to be...kind of fun? And a way quicker read than any poorly-structured book over five hundred pages has any right to be. At the beginning of the month, I was STRESSING about the idea of reading 1000 pages of Marissa Meyer superhero content on top of, like, midterms and basic human responsibilities.But it seems to be going peachily. (Massive shoutout to Google Drive for not marking the adverb version of “peachy” I just made up a spelling error. I feel like a linguistic prophet.)Also, I think Marissa Meyer puts forth a good effort in terms of diversity in this book. And she kind of always has. Cinder came out in 2013, back when SJM was just writing undiverse books instead of undiverse books feigning diversity, and presumably when JK Rowling’s Twitter was something other than a nonstop fountain flowing with cringe. Cinder is pretty diverse, considering.Marissa Meyer has always seemed to me like one of the only YA authors who may actually care about diversity for diversity’s sake, rather than point-scoring. Which is rad.There’s also a really interesting exploration of good versus evil and moral ambiguity in this book. Essentially what Wildcard stumbled over itself trying to do, except this was actually remotely good. And also this wasn’t constantly interrupting itself to have its female protagonist moon over a very annoying and morally corrupt man.Other good things: I don’t know if this is fully one hundred percent unambiguously good, but I think there is POTENTIAL for me liking these characters. I am the closest to liking Nova. If a seven on the ten-point love scale is “truly like,” I am probably at 5.5 with her. Close second, Oscar, then Ruby, then Honey, then Adrian. If Archenemies really puts in work, I may end up liking one or two of them.There is absolutely no question of me possibly liking any other character in this series.But here is the single most surprising thing I liked about this series, and I’m almost embarrassed to say it…Okay, FINE. It was the romance! I liked the romance.It’s nice. It’s slow burn. The characters are awkward and both like nO STOP I DON’T LIKE ANYONE. I AM THE VOID. I FEEL NOTHING. Which is very fun. I think they’re a good match and oh my god I am going to go lay in a pond now since when do I say things like “a good match.”Closing out this review like we started it: With me having a minor existential crisis over my own identity.Bottom line: This was notgood, per se, but it was fun and fine!----------currently-reading updates""I can't wait to read this book,"" I say, and then wait almost a year before reading this bookplease be better than Heartless----------tbr reviewI can't forget the pain Heartless caused me, but Marissa...I'm willing to forgive.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28421168-renegades,Renegades.txt
A Conjuring of Light,"Anoshe was a word for strangers in the street, and lovers between meetings, for parents and children, friends and family. It softened the blow of leaving. Eased the strain of parting. A careful nod to the certainty of today, the mystery of tomorrow. When a friend left, with little chance of seeing home, they said anoshe. When a loved one was dying, they said anoshe. When corpses were burned, bodies given back to the earth and souls to the stream, those left grieving said anoshe.Anoshe brought solace. And hope. And the strength to let go.me: *slams fist on table* time to write acol reviewinner me: you can't write a serious one even if they paid youinner me: you're going to babble and yell incoherentlyinner me: it would be full of cringeinner me: and you will also cryme: *slams two fists on table* THATS THE PLANI HONESTLY DONT KNOW WHERE TO START. SO MANY FEELINGS.acolis a beautiful conclusion of one ofmy most favorite book seriesand i spent 10 minutes crying because it's over. i can't easily let my favorite characters and one of my favorite worlds go.i pulled an allnighter to read this book, i binge read it for 11 hours, had like 2 hours of sleep in two days, paced around my flat like a fucking zombie numb and empty after i finished it and I REGRET NOTHING. i loved this book so much!!! it's so intense, action-packed and glorious. i enjoyed the story and all characters interactions and i WISH it would've been longer (even tho its 600+ pages lmao)this book made me cry so fucking much though. like, i don't cry easily and GODDAMN IT VICTORIA 	why.acolmade me feel so many things, it made me laugh, made me cry, made me so worried sometimes, i felt like dying. sometimes it was SO FUCKING CREEPY and sometimes it was so FLUFFY. also JEEZ there was no relaxing, something good happens and you're like 'oh phew' and then you turn the page AND SHIT HITS YOU IN THE FACE. pls give me a break????i'm very sad that the story has ended but at the same time im very happy.A Conjuring of Light may mark the end of one adventure, but remember: when it comes to this world, new doors are always being made.- Victoria Schwab!!!!!!!!!!everything further contains spoilers which i won't mark as spoilers so PLEASE don't read it further if you haven't read the book yet!!!!!!!!!!listen, i expected it to be cool, but it was way cooler??? but what's with this KILLING SPREE. remember when victoria was like oh this book is 35% death and i was like phew it doesnt sound so bad AND THEN THIS BOOK MURDERED LIKE EVERY SIDE CHARACTER I CARED ABOUT AND I WAS LIKE WHAT THE FUCK VICTORIA. i cried the hardest at calla's death, maxim's death, hastra's death (omg i cant even think abt it without tearing up??? he thought he was a bad guard and then he saved kell and,,,,send help why did my tiny son die he should've been a priest but then kell might've died WHY) AND HOLLAND'S DEATH (i knew holland would die and i knew he would die like he did (finally free and calm but JESUS. FUCKING. CHRIST. i didn't know i have so many tears in me).“Death comes for us all,” said Holland evenly. “I would simply have mine mean something.”about holland though. for me he was the highlight of this book. i didn't like him in the first book and thenagoshappened and i softened to him BUT IN THIS FUCKING BOOK HE JUST BROKE MY HEART SO MANY TIMES MY SOFT SPOT FOR HIM IS THE SIZE OF OUR UNIVERSE. he got a redemption arc and this redemption arc is 9138483/10, his backstory made me cry so many times (like, his brother tried to kill him when he was a little boy???? a girl he loved and was happy with tried to kill him?? his best friend was killed and he couldn't save him??? he was tortured and captured and he couldn't do anything about it but just count his kills (i will never stop crying that he did it) and suffer??? and then it happened again after he just got free??? my poor tortured soN, i wanted to tuck him in the bed and cover him with all the blankets i have). i loved his interaction with kell so much and i loved holland so much and i can't convey my emotions about him in the text because DAMMIT he's totally the best character of this book and one of the best antagonists-but-not-really i've ever read about and can i have more characters like holland pretty please. i fucking started bawling when he trapped osaron and then i kept sobbing when he woke up and i couldn't stop weeping when he died because i knew it would happen and in a way it was a perfect ending for him (he died and his world lived and that is what he always desired and awknfaliefn im dead) but DAMN IT HURTS.Lila met Holland’s gaze, expecting—maybe even hoping—to find that cold, implacable calm, perhaps tinged with disgust. Instead, she found shades of sadness, loss. And somehow, strength. The strength to go on. To try again. To trust.i loved INTERACTIONS in this book so much.kell and rhy are forever my most favorite brother duo. they love and care about each other so much i would die for them.rhy and alucard are two idiots in love and i hope they're forever happy. alucard's backstory is so horrible (i cant believe his brother survived but good people didnt wtf can he jump off a cliff thank u very much nobody needs him) and i'm so happy that rhy understood and forgave him and wjskfeafjsklfskl pls be happy.kell and lila (!!!!!!!!!!!!!). i shipped them from the very beginning AND THEY FINALLY GOT TOGETHER AND THEY'RE SOOO CUUUUTEEE. i love kell and lila and their relationship and the fact that kell would rather shoot himsef in the head than trust her (jk). i love how they're different but they complete each other in their own way. i love that the series wasn't really focused on their romance, but it's still enough and it's beautiful and i want to cri. also kell is very efficient teacher isnt he.Ned stared at her with open awe. “You’re like him.”“No,”said Kell dryly, striding past him. “She’s one of a kind.”kell and alucard gave me life with their bickering.kell and holland!!!!!!!!!!! good shit right here!!!!!!!!!! kell cared about holland and i cried at this and i wish it was different between them, like, holland is so older brother material for kell and AAAAAAAAAAAAA. and holland, too, was pretty fond of kell here i think. and i want to weep again because it could've been so much more.ALSO THE SQUAD aka kell, rhy, lila and alucard. omg how much i loved that scene when they drank together and their interactions overall AND I WISH THERE WERE MORE because damn this is the squad i can read hours about.THE THREE ANTARI. one of the best things that happened in this book. i wanted this from the very beginning and YESSSS kell, lila and holland finally worked together AND HOLLAND WAS THE ANCHOR, THE CENTER and this is perfect???Lila looked to Kell. “You didn’t teach me this one.”His jaw was slack. “I …I didn’t know it.”Holland gave them both a bland look. “Amazing,”he said dryly. “There are still things you haven’t learned.”i loved all characters in this book, and thanks to victoria schwab for creating them and i cant believe i have to say good bye to them.*cries externally**cries internally**cries eternally*as i already said im pretty satisfied with the closure. but i'm not satisfied with complete lack of backstory for lila. like, kell's parents thing was at least acknowledged, holland got a decent backstory that i will never stop crying about, but lila got nothing. i wanted to know more about her from the very beginning of the series and we didn't even get glimpses into her past. (i also don't understand how she almost died when kell said 93289894 times inadsomthat antari are almost invincible and it's really hard, almost impossible to kill them and then bam lila could've died if holland didn't heal her. i understand that her wound was fatal but idk). pretty much only issues i have with this book tho.overall, for me this book was perfect. fast, intense and exciting. i wish it weren't the end.pls hold me while im crying12108392810293/10It wasn’t a good-bye, not really.What was the word for parting?Anoshe.That was it.Until another day.Anoshe.~~~~~~~did i finish this book or did this book finish me?fyi i spent last two parts fucking bawlingmy pillow is wet my nose is running my eyes are dry i feel empty and dead inside i need a hugrtc hopefully~~~~~~~pre-reading:*new updates are posted in the beginningfirst of all, is this holland vs danes twins flashbacksecond, WILL thERE BE A MOMENT WHERE HOLLAND DOENST GET HURT JESUS~~~WHY R U SO CRUEL STOP TORTURING ME @VESCHWAB~~~im dead dead dead dying dead dead deceased14 days until acol im yelling~~~#GiveHollandABreak#HollandProtectionSquadwhat has become of this review~~~(srcVictoria's twitter)H E L L O :-)~~~HI GUYS I AM SCREAMING YOURE WELCOME TO JOIN ME*yells*~~~i love how alucard cant stop antagonizing kell50 days YAy~~~TELL ME ITS ABOUT HOLLAND IT MUST BE ABOUT HOLLAND RIGHT~~~this is also very beautiful i havefeelings™~~~hnnnng~~~my precious girl i miss her so much~~~:D~~~9/10/16AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK E L L L A U G H E D my baby~~~8/10/16;А;~~~15/09/16ACOL'S FIRST SNIPPETY'ALL~~~10/06/16i am fine this is fine i aM NOT FINE HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO WAIT UNTIL FEBRUARY VICTORIA IS SO CRUEL(i am trying to prepare for my exam which is tomorrow AND SHE DROPS THAT)~~~23/05/16How was she supposed to fight a woman whose knives didn’t even stay in her hands?The answer, of course, was simple: the same way she fought anyone else.Quick and dirty.THE COVER IS SO BEAUTIFUL OH MY GOD SO GORGEOUS I'M HYPERVENTILATINGTHE EXCERPT ALSO!!!!

A Darker Shade of Magic,"”Magic was a truly beautiful disease.”And it was such a pleasure to read about it! XD I can’t say how much I loved and adored this book! Alone the magic in this was everything and it was so dark and twisted that it was a delight to read about it. In“A Darker Shade of Magic”magic is a living and breathing thing and it can help and heal at least as much as it can corrupt and destroy. In my opinion this was a really great concept and I lived and breathed for the execution of it.”The words themselves were less important than the focus they brought to the speaker’s mind, the connection they helped to form, the power they tapped into. In short, the language did not matter, only the intention did.”Still, it wasn’t only the magical aspect of this book that kept me glued to the pages. The mere idea of four different parallel Londons that exist next to each other was more than just intriguing as well. Sure, we didn’t get to see an awful lot of them because the characters travel through them and don’t stay all too long, the little I saw was enough to keep me hooked though. ;-) London is my favourite city and the mere idea to explore four different versions of this town already made me feel like I won the jackpot. *lol*And last but not least “A Darker Shade of Magic” had its fair share of intriguing and complex characters that caused my eyes to sparkle. We all know that I can’t resist the temptation of morally grey and ambivalent characters so it’s no surprise that I savoured this like a delicious gourmet dinner. Alone the villains of this book!!! The Dane Twins were such evil creatures yet I couldn’t help but want to read more about them. Ohh and Holland! Don’t even get me started on Holland! <3 Or well, maybe I actually should start to talk about him. In the characters section, of course! ;-PThe characters:Good afternoon, fellow Antari! It’s a good day to travel between the worlds but be careful nevertheless. There is always a shadow lurking at the next corner of the street and if you’re not cautious it will not only attack you but also spoil you big time as well! Tread carefully, my dear friend! You’re being observed by dark forces. ;-)Kell:”Kell tipped his head so that his copper hair tumbled out of his eyes, revealing not only the crisp blue of the left one but the solid black of the right. A black that ran edge to edge, filling white and iris both. There was nothing human about that eye. It was pure magic. The mark of a blood magician. Of an Antari.”I’m such a sucker for red-heads and Kell is really yummy. ;-P I can’t help it! Really! They are my kryptonite. Ask Lucien. *lol* Anyway, Kell is a really interesting character and he definitely has more depth than initially meets the eye. On the outside you might think that he’s the typical hero, but the more I discovered about his life, the more I felt sorry for him. He is part of the royal family and might seem to have it all, but when push came to shove his true status among the royals was revealed and my heart ached for him. I know Lila didn’t understand what he meant but by the end of the book it became pretty clear that he wasn’t really a family member but rather a valuable asset. At least when it came to his “parents”. Despite this he still had his own moral code and acted according to it, even if it meant that he was at a disadvantage when he had to face Holland and the Dane twins. Poor Kell! I had the feeling in some way or another he was figuratively and quite literally bleeding throughout the entire book. *lol* Let’s hope things will get better for him in “A Gathering of Shadows”! ;-)”Magic was a living thing – that, everyone knew – but to Kell it felt like more, like a friend, like family. It was, after all, a part of him (much more than it was a part of most) and he couldn’t help feeling like it knew what he was saying, what he was feeling, not only when he summoned it, but always, in every heartbeat and every breath.”She always went looking for the truth in his right eye, as if it were a scrying board, something to be gazed into, seen past. But what she saw, she never shared. Kell took her hand and kissed it. “I’m fine, Your Majesty.” She gave him a weary look, and he corrected himself. “Mother.””I said Rhy forgave them.” Kell pushed to his feet. “I never said I did.”Lila Bard:”Death comes for everyone,” she said simply. “I’m not afraid of dying. But I am afraid of dying here.” She swept her hand over the room, the tavern, the city. “I’d rather die on an adventure than live standing still.”I’m not entirely sure if I like Lila or not. XD I mean I admire her resilience and stubbornness but I think sometimes she was way too sure of herself and that got her into a lot of trouble. *lol* But oh well, when it comes down to it there is no denying that I actually like her. Her character seems to be somewhat of an acquired taste and I’m curious if she’ll truly become a pirate in the end. Also I could relate to her when it came to her choice of clothes. I would have gone for the boy’s clothes in a heartbeat as well. ;-P (Could it be that Lila is non-binary or gender fluid?!) Generally speaking I think it wasn’t easy to relate to her because she kept everyone at a distance and didn’t let anything get too close to her. For me this made it kind difficult to gauge her character and I hope we’ll get a better grip on it in the next two books. Now that I think about it, I had the same feeling when it came to Blue Sargent throughout the first two books of “The Raven Cycle”. I only really got to know her in “Blue Lily, Lily Blue” so I hope the same will happen with Lila in the next book. XD”What are you?” he asked, amazed.Lila only shrugged. “Stubborn.””Love doesn’t keep us from freezing to death, Kell,” she continued, “or starving, or being knifed for the coins in our pocket. Love doesn’t buy us anything, so be glad for what you have and who you have because you may want for things but you need for nothing.”Holland:”He didn’t know if it was the evenness in the man’s tone or his strangely faded appearance or his haunted eyes – one black, of course, the other a milky green. Or perhaps it was the way he seemed to be made more of water and stone than flesh and blood and soul.”I love Holland, okay?! I know he’s supposed to be one of the villains but seriously, how could I not adore him?! <3 His character was so multi-layered, complex, calculating, determined and cruel. It was so nice to watch him in action. *lol* I just can’t resist a decent villain and Holland had all the makings of one. XD Especially an intriguing background story. I really wish we would have gotten more of it though. I mean we only got the necessary details to keep the story moving but there are so many things I would have loved to read about. I guess it was Schwab’s intention to keep us in the dark, because this might sound paranoid but I’mCONVINCEDthat Holland will reappear in the next book! I don’t buy his death!!! There’s no way he died! He said it’s hard to kill an Antari and he was still breathing and alive when Kell sent him to Black London.THE SOURCEof black magic! Hell, this has trouble written all over it! If you ask me Kell basically handed him the means to come back even stronger! >_< Kell is so going to regret this!”Looking into Holland’s eye made her skin crawl. Dark things swirled just beneath the smooth black depths. One word whispered through her mind. Run.””Hesitation is the death of advantage,” mused Holland and Kell fought in vain against the metal pinnings.”I hope you made him suffer,” she spat, turning towards the looming castle.No, thought Kell as they set off. He suffered long enough.Rhy:“Yes. Because unless you plan to wed me yourself – and don’t get me wrong, I think we’d make a dashing pair – I must try and find a mate.”“And you think you’ll find one traipsing around the city?”“Goodness, no,” said Rhy with a crooked grin. “But who knows what fun I’ll find while failing.”Rhy is such a precious bean! He gave me Nikolai and Hypnos vibes so it’s no wonder I almost instantly adored him! *lol* He sounds like a lot of fun but unfortunately we didn’t get to see all too much of him in this book. I hope that will change in the next one though. (Also he seems to be unapologetically bi and I live and breathe for characters like that!!!) Still, judging by the little we saw and heard of him I can already tell that he loves Kell like a brother and would never do anything to harm him. I can’t help but wonder what he thinks about his parent’s reaction though. If Kell wouldn’t have been bound to him they would have either killed him or sent him to prison so it’s pretty obvious that Kell was right about their intentions all along. I can’t wait to see more of funny, caring and kind Rhy so there better be more scenes with him in “A Gathering of Shadows”. Also was it just me or did Holland and Rhy actually flirt with each other? It’s such a shame he was merely a means to an end for him. I bet from now on Rhy won’t trust people as easily as before.Rhy’s hands curled into fists. “How could you?” he said, and Kell worried that the prince was bitter about being tethered to him. Instead, Rhy said, “How could you carry that weight?”Rhy laughed silently. “I apologize for anything I might have done. I was not myself.”“I apologize for shooting you in the leg,” said Lila. “I was myself entirely.”Rhy broke into his perfect smile.“I like this one,” he said to Kell.The Dane Twins:”Jealous?” he asked. Holland’s two-toned eyes held Athos’s, the green and the black both steady, unblinking. “He suffered,” added Athos softly. “But not like you.” He brought his mouth closer. “No one suffers as beautifully as you.”Okay! Can anyone please tell me how exactly Holland suffered?!!! I mean it’s indicated that there was something sexual and cruel going on between Athos and him but WHAT EXACTLY??!!! Apparently the Dane Twins had a reputation of torturing and forcing people to do their will. And Holland was under their spell as well so I can only assume that he suffered kind of “Rhysand/Amarantha style”? Also there was only a brief mention that Holland didn’t win the throne because he wasn’t cruel enough to take it before the Danes did. What exactly happened before they ascended the White throne?! I really wish we would have gotten more details here, because this really sounded like an interesting story! Either way the Dane twins gave me the creeps. Astrid even more than her brother Athos. Magic and malice indeed. *shudders* They made for pretty intriguing villains for sure. XD I’m just glad Kell never became Astrid’s toy. He certainly wouldn’t have survived it.”Astrid Dane is made of magic and malice.”The relationships & ships:Lila & Kell:”You don’t know anything about these worlds,” he said, but the fight was bleeding out of his voice.“Sure I do,” countered Lila cheerfully. “There’s Dull London, Kell London, Creepy London, and Dead London,” she recited, ticking them off on her fingers. “See? I’m a fast learner.”Is it just me or was Kell ending up on Lila’s bed TWICE in one night some sort of a broad hint? The first time it was even BDSM style! *lol* I guess we all know in which direction their future relationship is going to head. Haha! ;-P Also they kissed at least twice for good luck as well and they both had more luck than brain. Right after the motto “Fortune favours fools!” So they didn’t need the luck but obviously were looking for an opportunity to kiss. XD They were very different but for some reason they still worked. Maybe it’s because they balance each other and magic is all about balance as we already learned. Plus they are both Antari. I wonder how their relationship is going to continue. There is a lot of potential that only needs to be explored. ;-P”I’m not going to die,” she said. “Not till I’ve seen it.”“Seen what?”Her smile widened. “Everything.”Kell smiled back. And then Lila brought her free hand to his jaw and tugged his mouth towards hers. The kiss was there and then gone, like one of her smiles.A wry smile cut across Lila’s mouth. “You’re a smuggler.”“Says the pickpocket,” snapped Kell defensively.Rhy & Kell:”What sons our parents have,” said Kell gently. “Between the two of us, we’ll tear the whole world down.”They might not be brothers by blood but they are brothers by heart! <33 I loved their relationship so much and I was so glad that Rhy truly cared about Kell! Which is more than can be said about his parents, but Kell already knew that. >_< I felt so sorry for him but at least he has Rhy and he wouldn’t allow anything to happen to him. Those two seem to balance each other as well and I’m kind of beginning to see a pattern here. *lol* In their relationship dynamic it seems like Rhy is the daredevil who gets into trouble though and Kell is more the mature and responsible one. I can only imagine in which kind of mess they’ll get in the next book. One thing is for sure, I can’t wait to read more about this brotherly duo! ;-P”He looked up and saw me crouching over him, bleeding, and the first thing he said wasn’t ‘What happened?’ or ‘Where are we?’ He touched the blood on his chest and said, ‘Is it yours? Is it all yours?’ and when I nodded, he burst into tears, and I took him home.”Conclusion:I absolutely LOVED this!“A Darker Shade of Magic”had everything I’m looking for in a book. There was (dark) magic, there were four parallel Londons and there were lots of complex characters I couldn’t help but want to read more about. Yes, the world building and some of the characters themselves might have been rather sketchy, but knowing Schwab I’m certain that we’ll get more details in the following books. This was only just the beginning and what a marvellous one it was! XD___________________________I’m going to read this!FINALLY!!!There are about a thousand of reasons why I wanted to read this for ages and yet I still didn’t manage to get to it! Typical me!I’m going to stop procrastinating now though!I’m ready to tackle this seriesBECAUSE:- Four parallel Londons!- Magic!- A smuggler!- A thief!- V.E. SCHWAB!!!!Do I even have to say more??!!I’m so ready for this!Just bring it on! I got this!

A Heart So Fierce and Broken,"“What we do know is what’s most important: this prince’s reign will come to an end, one way or another.”This review is long, longer than what will probably be allowed on this website so click!!HERE!!for the link to my blog!First and foremost I’d like to say, if you haven’t read A Curse so Dark and Lonely, please go read that before reading this. Or click!!HERE!!if you’re interested in watching my review on that!I’m not holding back on spoilers for that book as there’s no way to explain what I hated about this without spoiling. There’s a lot about this book that truly got on my nerves and ruined the book for me, but there’s a tiny bit of good so I’ll go over it all. This review will contain ACSDAL spoilers only, you don’t have to worry about spoilers for this book.---OverviewThis book picks up a couple of months after the events and ending of A Curse so Dark and Lonely. And the story is told from Grey’s point of view, as well as a new character, Lia Mara. Grey is hiding, after finding out he’s the rightful heir to the Throne and that his blood is filled with magic. And Rhen is looking for him, not knowing Grey is the heir, but just wanting to find his friend. While at the same time Rhen is also sending out search parties to find this supposed heir to have him killed so Rhen can fully take the throne. Pretty much the entirety of this book is Grey trying to escape the clutches of Rhen and Rhen turning into a complete sack of shit.While on the other hand, we have Lia Mara who really is in this story for no important reason. I truly question why she has a point of view because she’s of no importance to the plot until the very end. But Lia Mara is from Syhl Shallow, the kingdom that tried to conquer Rhen’s lands in the first book. Anyways, her mother Karis Luran is trying to work out a deal to unite Syhl Shallow and Emberfall but Lia thinks she can do it a better way than her mother. So she tries to talk Rhen into better ways of finding peace, but in the meantime ends up meeting the true heir to the throne.This causes a lot of issues for Rhen, Lia, and Grey since they are all now inevitably tied up. You’re probably thinking at this point “Well what about Harper, she was the main character of ACSDAL?” Well, she is of no use in this book. Like she was just thrown to the side so Grey and Lia Mara and Rhen could take the shine. Harper is maybe in it a couple of times and even then she only has a few speaking lines. We don’t see much of her but when we do it’s obviously important, I still just think it’s a crime that she isn’t in it very much.So yeah, really this is 450 pages of Rhen trying to find Grey, Grey trying to evade Rhen, and Lia Mara trying to … bring peace to the Kingdoms I guess.My Issues w/ This Book (minus spoilers:)If I truly wanted to get into everything I hated about this book, you’d be reading this for hours so I’m just going to be talking about three things that gave me a huge headache.Number One: Give Rhen a Break.As everyone knows, Rhen is the troubled man from book one who was cursed into turning into a beast and who eventually killed his whole kingdom. He’s been through a lot, he’s broken as the title itself explains, but in this book, the author turns him into the villain. His whole mindset has changed, he’s vicious, and just it seemed to come out of nowhere. Now I can understand why he wants the heir dead. The dude has magic and is supposed to take over the only thing Rhen holds dear, his people and his throne. And Rhen’s life has been ruined and wrecked because of magic. The only thing that should change Rhen’s outlook is the fact that the rightful heir and his brother IS Grey. Which Rhen doesn’t know that of course, but there are some scenes in this book that I would never see ACSDAL Rhen doing. I could understand if his attitude got sour and evil over a SIGNIFICANT amount of time and at some point he’s willing to do whatever to kill this heir, but it’s only been a couple of months and homedude has completely changed. The MAIN reason I didn’t vibe with this at all, is because this is exactly what Sarah J. Maas did with Tamlin in the ACOTAR series. We have our main savior in book one (which both of their book ones were BATB retellings btw) and then he turned into a sadistic controlling crazy ass character. At this point, and by the end of this book, I just don’t care for Rhen anymore because his character completely changed with no real development and it’s incredibly unbelievable.Number Two: Where is the Colored Skin?I’m not usually one to care when a book is filled with white people, I’ve been reading books like that my entire life. The first author who always comes to mind is Sarah J. Maas. And as pretty much everyone knows, I am SJM TRASH. But you cannot tell me that in the years 2019/2020 there should still be YA books with all White Casts. Even SJM learned from her mistakes and started to realize OH there are people in this world with colored skin. If I had to read one more time about how a new character/guard/ruler/peasant had creamy white pale skin, I was going to gauge my eyes out. In ACSDAL there is one black character (Noah), a side character who shows up at the end to help out, and then he’s just on the sidelines. And Noah is in this book as well, but he is STILL the only PoC in this whole entire series. I personally saw Lia Mara as having brown skin but it’s hard to believe because her whole family had creamy pale skin. I’m so tired of having to read books in YA now that are only meant for white people, like please it’s not hard to give your characters some color. I think truly the thing that aggravated me the most was the fact that almost every characters skin was either creamy white or pale. Just like melted ice cream.When it comes to diversity, the main gay couple from ACSDAL is still in this book, a lot more than I expected. And there is mention of one sapphic couple at the end for a good half of a sentence. This is another reason that upset me so much is you have characters with disabilities, you have Queer characters, but wooo no ma'am on the People of Color.Number Three: No Such Thing as Development.I don’t even know how to say this nicely but who the hell proofread this and thought “wow yes this is much excellence, everything makes great sense, let’s start passing these ARC’s out.” Because there is so much in this that needed help. Okay so, I have taken into consideration that of course, this is the first batch of ARC’s to go out, there’s a lot of editing to do, but at the same time this doesn’t feel thought through at all. There is absolutely no reason this should have been as long as it was because there are so many filler scenes that are completely unnecessary. And okay, maybe those will be cut out and we’ll have a shorter book and BAM it will be better?! Wrong. Mainly due to the fact that the character development in this is nonexistent. As I’ve already said, Rhen turns evil but … there is no development and no explanation as to why he’s turned into such a douche. You have to piece it together yourself, which truly isn’t hard. But it also wouldn’t have been hard to weave in chapters from Rhens PoV so his Evil Arch could have been explained and believable. The same goes for Grey and Lia Mara. One second Grey is denying things about who he is and what he wants in life and then BAM all of a sudden he’s changed his mind out of nowhere and now this is the way his life must go. Like … what? And just WOO what was the point of Lia Mara being in this book besides the end because she could have had maybe 5 chapters but NO this whole entire thing is a trade-off between Grey and Lia. There are so many unimportant aspects to this story that completely ruined it for me and I couldn’t focus on the plot or the storyline because the lack of development and the lack of character growth is astounding. And dear Lord, don’t even get me started on the trash ass romance.Surprise I Enjoyed this A Little Bit Though:I did rate this three out of five stars though because there is some good. ACSDAL is one of my favorite books of 2019, which is why I was so fast and excited to pick up the sequel (shoutout to Lily over at Lair of Books for sending me her ARC.) So, of course, I love these characters, I love this world, and I have some love for this book. But it’s very minimal and it’s only the fact that I got to be in Grey’s head because I love him more than anything and it was great to see more of him. And even despite the fact that Rhen is trash and Harper is hardly in this book, it was still great to see them as well.I did end up reading the whole book in one night, which is why I didn’t give it a shit rating because Brigid’s books are so easy to blow through and I really wanted to keep reading the book because of how much I love being in Greys PoV. But I kept getting sidetracked over how annoyed I was with the lack of growth, the character changes, and the fully white cast.Anyways, there is an ease to Brigid’s writing that just pulls you in, the plot itself isn’t bad at all, I think this would have been an incredible book if character decisions made sense and if there was actual depth to the characters. So I will definitely be rereading this once the book is out and in the world because I want to see if anything has changed.---This review is incredibly early, the book doesn’t come out until January 7th, 2020. But I wanted to get my thoughts out into the world and not have to have this on my mind anymore.I will never advise anyone to not read a book because that’s just shitty, but I would definitely say if you loved ACSDAL a lot, there is a lot in this that you may not necessarily enjoy.But anyways this review has gone on way too long at this point, thank you for your time, and Happy Reading Folks.~ <3 Sol",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42952728-a-heart-so-fierce-and-broken,A Heart So Fierce and Broken.txt
Rule of Wolves,"I’m onBookTube! =)”Men who see too much have a way of losing their eyes.”“And queens who trust too little have a way of losing their thrones.”Don’t you love it when those bitter truths are thrown in your face? *lol* Queen Makhi and Yerwei were quite the duo and they continued to cause a lot of trouble in the second book. Despite that they weren’t an all too huge part of it though and I guess that was okay?! I have pretty mixed feelings about this series because on the one hand I absolutely adore Nikolai, Zoya and Nina, but on the other hand I always had the feeling that there could have been more?! It’s really hard to put this into words but I guess what it ultimately comes down to is that I didn’t enjoy the “King of Scars” duology as much as I thought I would.I know I’m probably the only unpopular opinion here (at least when you look at all those raving 5 star reviews) but at the end of the day all I can do is to add my two cents and to hope that people will understand where I’m coming from. I mean 3,5 stars rounded up to 4 is still a great rating, because I DID enjoy the book, it just wasn’t what I expected? Hoped for? Wanted? XD Of course Leigh Bardugo can write her story the way she wants to, she’s the author after all, but I personally think there was a lot of potential that was lost somewhere along the way. No matter if it’s the storyline of the Starless Saint or how everything worked out with the Fjerdans in the end. There were so many possibilities how things could have developed and changed but most of them weren’t even used or used in a way I couldn’t get behind.I know it’s always tough to write a good and well-rounded ending and I guess there were just too many things to handle after the final pages of the first book, but I still wish some of them would have been done differently. Anyway! My ship sailed, Leigh killed me once again and the conversations and easy banter were amazing and fun as always. So yeah, there were many things I enjoyed and that caused me to give this book four stars in the end. Before I go on and on I better just head to my spoilery characters section though and write all those mixed feelings down over there.The characters:Ravka is probably not the best place to be on a vacation right now, but we still hope you’ll enjoy our hospitality. Discover our new inventions and don’t get too close to our spoiler machine. It’s not functional yet and might vomit spoilers all over you! But who knows, maybe this is exactly your cup of tea: Wanna step a little bit closer?! ;-PNikolai:”How unfair. I have plenty of faith,” Nikolai objected.Tolya raised a brow. “In what?”“Good engineering and better whiskey.”Me too, Nikolai, me too! *lol* I really love Nikolai Lantsov and he’s one of the most precious beans of the entire Grishaverse. (The only other bean at least as precious is Wylan. ;-P) Unfortunately my boy had a lot to deal with in this book and his character development definitely was more on the grim and serious side, which is understandable if you have to fight for everything your entire life. And boy did he fight! Nikolai gave everything for his country, his blood and sweat and tears, but in the end a small rumour was enough to kick him off his throne. I hated this so much because, yes his father was Opjer but his mother was still the queen of Ravka and he was more of a king than anyone else that claimed their right on the throne. It was unfair but I suppose that’s how people are. Just because he wasn’t the king’s son and had a demon within him they turned their backs on him and decided they wanted another leader. The injustice of it all... I’m still not over it and it makes me so angry!! T_T My precious Nikolai deserved better than this. After everything he did for his country... he deserved better than this... *sobs* I mean yes, he’s still somewhat the consort of the new queen but urgh he almost died for them, he bled for them and that’s how they thank him for it?! >_<”War was like fire – sudden, hungry, and easiest to stop before it had taken hold. He would do all he could to contain this blaze. He feared for his country and for himself. He’d be a fool not to. But some part of him, maybe the privateer, maybe the demon, maybe the prince who had clawed his way to the throne, was itching for a fight.””Maybe the gift of being human is that we do not give up – even when all hope is lost.””All over Os Alta today, there are funerals. People are grieving. We are facing a new and terrible challenge, a different kind of enemy and a different kind of war, but just as we grieve together, we’ll face this new enemy together. We will fight just as we grieve, side by side.””He was happy to pick up a sword or a pen on Ravka’s behalf, to go without sleep or comfort in order to see a mission through. But kings didn’t take action – not the way that a privateer or even a general could. Being a king meant second-guessing every move, considering countless variables before making a decision, knowing that each choice might have consequences that others would pay for.”Zoya:”She could never be sure if it was her own voice or Juris’ that spoke in her head. She only knew that his presence within her was real. No figment of her imagination could be so irritating.”Ahh Zoya! My queen had a really nice character arc and I’m very thankful for that. I loved to see how she forged her own path and figured out how to resolve her issues. I think the most important thing for her was to accept herself and to learn how to love herself, because if you don’t do that you’re not open to let other people into your heart. The only person that stood in her way was Zoya herself and I’m glad she finally opened up to others and allowed herself to be human. It didn’t only make her stronger but also a better person. Or dragon?! I cannot not talk about her turning into a fierce dragon because OMG!!! That scene was totally amazing! Ravka’s new queen is quite literally a fire breathing dragon saint! *lol* Also I have no idea why their people accept a dragon on the throne but not the kind of monster Nikolai has become, because erm yeah... both not exactly human, but okay?!Sweet words and grand declarations were for other people, other lives. She brushed the hair back from his face, placed a kiss on his forehead. “I would stay forever if I could,” she whispered. He wouldn’t remember anyway.”Did she want to forget? What a gift that would be. To never feel as humans did, to never grieve again. Then it wouldn’t be so hard to leave this room. To shut the door on what might have been. To say goodbye.””And if something happened to him on that battlefield? She’d been too afraid to say yes to him, to show him the truth of her longing, to admit that from the first time she’d seen him, she’d know he was the hero of all her aunt’s stories, the boy with the golden spirit full of light and hope. All Saints, Zoya wanted to be near that light, she wanted to feel the warmth of it for as long as she could.””She would forever be a bloodthirsty, furious girl, but she might allow herself to be something else too. If she had helped to earn peace for Ravka, then maybe she could grant her own heart a bit of peace as well.”Nina:”Her friendship with Hanne had helped to heal that wound. This mission, this purpose had helped, but the pain was still there and she suspected it always would be. His life had been stolen from him, and Matthias had never had the chance to find his own purpose. I served it, my love. I protected you. To the very end.”So while Zoya and Nikolai fought for Ravka, Nina continued to be the spy in their enemies’ home. Which was a necessary role but still didn’t satisfy me? I mean I get why Nina remained in her role as a spy but I really wish her character’s story would have gone in a different direction. Especially at the ending. I mean she lost so much and all this just because of Brum and the Fjerdan’s old beliefs that Grisha are witches, yet she still stays in Fjerda to change the country for the better and this even as Mila and not as herself. *sighs deeply* I don’t know why Nina and Hanne being doomed to be in someone else’s skin for the rest of their lives is getting to me so much... but I think it has to do with me feeling good in my own skin? I remember being upset about Wylan posing as Kuwei and how much I hoped for him to be tailored back into his old self. It’s just... it doesn’t sit well with me. Maybe it’s because I’m gender fluid and it took me so long to understand myself and to be able to express my male and female side. The fact that you’d be stuck in a body that isn’t yours and this for the rest of your life? It’s just... argh! *shudders* I don’t like this idea. At all.”You are the lowest form of man. Without honor, without integrity. Djel djeren je töp.” Djel turns his back on you.“Mila!” Ylva gasped.Brum’s lips flattened. “You are no longer welcome in our home.”Nina laughed. “I don’t keep company with vermin. My place is with the wolves.”The Darkling:”Human life is worth preserving. But human lives? They come and go like so much chaff, never tipping the scales.”And here is another plot line that could have been so good but ended up being a wasted opportunity. I mean what exactly was the point in bringing the Darkling back into the game? Aside of the nice talk he had with Alina and Mal he didn’t really add anything important to the story. His followers were in no position to give him the power he craved for and his fruitless journey to sainthood was pretty disappointing, dull and unnecessary. The only thing his character was good for in the end was to stop the plague from spreading. And he did it willingly... I mean the most egoistic and notoriously pitiless character ever just allowed them to spike him on a huge thorn in order to stop the blight?! Suffering for eternity and going through immeasurable and excruciating pain. Did I miss a memo?! Apparently he only came back to fulfil that purpose but it was a story line I just couldn’t wrap my head around, especially because his sudden willingness to sacrifice himself for others was so out of character. >_< Why Leigh?!”He would go to the Fold. He would find those who followed the Starless Saint.He would teach the world awe.”Prince Rasmus:”It’s hard to believe in a god that would deny me breath.”The Prince of Fjerda and his servant Joran. Pff... another storyline I have to pick a bone with. I really liked the idea of the prince of Fjerda having a good heart and understanding the needs of his people because his health has been bad ever since he was born. He could have had such a unique outlook on things and strengthened by Hanne’s powers he could have changed Fjerda for the better. But nope, that’s not the story we got. Rasmus turned out to be an even worse tyrant than his father and Brum and in the end he died because Hanne was forced to kill him. I dunno about you but for me this was like a slap in the face. XD Not happy about Hanne and Nina posing as the prince and Mila for the rest of their lives. I mean Hanne might be okay in his body (she could have tailored herself male though and she could have still been herself) but Nina in Mila’s body and this until she dies... Okay I won’t say more.”I know the way people talk about me. I know they wish I hadn’t been born at all and that my little brother could be the one to inherit.”Hanne’s face was fierce. “Well then, you must stay alive to spite them.”The relationships & ships:Zoya & Nikolai:”What they had endured on the Fold had connected them in some way, and he knew he would see Zoya when he turned – yet the sight of her struck like a sudden change in the weather. A drop in temperature, the crackle of electricity in the air, the feeling of a storm coming on.”Zoyalai!!! My ship finally sailed and gosh was I happy about it! Those two were killing me with their tender moments, soft touches and easy banter. <333 Whenever they were in a scene together you could basically feel their chemistry crackling on the pages. I’m kinda sad we didn’t get even more of their moments because they were all so special and sweet, but I guess it’s better this way, because otherwise this would have turned into a lovey dovey romance and we all know Zoya isn’t exactly the romantic kinda girl. XD We’ll leave that to Nikolai because I’m sure he’ll spoil her senseless. *lol* Still, it took so long for Zoya to admit her feelings for him and I was so angry at her after the talk they had on the ship. I mean it almost took Nikolai dying for her to realize that she could have lost him forever. Then again this was totally in character for her so I can’t be mad at her. XD Also ADKFASLDFJSALKDF why is Nikolai so soft!!?? I can’t with him. I want a Nikolai Lantsov in my life! <333Zoya sat down beside Nikolai on the bed, trying not to jostle him.“You must be still,” she murmured.“Don’t go.”He shut his eyes and gripped her hand in his. Zoya knew the Healer had noticed it, knew he would probably gossip about it later. But she could weather the gossip.”All Saints, are you saying I haven’t seen you at your worst?”Zoya tossed her hair. “If you had, you’d be under the covers, gibbering prayers.”“A unique way of getting me into bed, but who am I to question your methods?””I would give you a crown if I could,” he said. “I would show you the world from the prow of a ship. I would choose you, Zoya. As my general, as my friend, as my bride. I would give you a sapphire the size of an acorn.” He reached into his pocket. “And all I would ask in return is that you wear this damnable ribbon in your hair on our wedding day.”She raised her hand and let her fingertips trace the line of his beautiful jaw. He closed his eyes. “We would go on, you and I. If I couldn’t be queen, you would find a way to win this battle and save this country. You would make a sheltering place for my people. You would march and bleed and crack terrible jokes until you had done all you said you would do. I suppose that’s why I love you.”His eyes flew open and his face lit in an extraordinary grin. “All Saints, say it again.”She didn’t want to ask. Her pride forbade it. But her damn pride had cost her enough. She looked away. “And if ... if I wished for more?” She felt his fingers on her chin, turning her head. There was an unwanted ache in her throat. Zoya forced herself to meet his gaze. In this light, his hazel eyes looked almost golden.“Then I would gladly be your prince, your consort, your demon fool.”Nina & Hanne:”I know all the things that aren’t good for me. And I want them just the same.”Nina’s throat was dry. “Do you?” she asked quietly. “Want them?”Hanne’s copper eyes glowed like topaz. Slowly she nodded. “Since the moment we met. Since you charged into that clearing like a girl I had dreamed into being.”Their ship was okay in here but I’m still not convinced by it, which is such a shame because I’m usually the first one to support an f/f ship. For some reason this one just didn’t do it for me though?! I had the same problem with Mia and Ash when I read “The Nevernight Chronicles” and I can’t exactly put my finger on it but their relationship just didn’t work for me. It was too sudden, too convenient; there wasn’t enough chemistry between the two. It all just felt very... flat and not passionate enough?! I dunno. Considering they were hiding their love in front of their enemy’s eyes, there should have been a firework of emotions and all-consuming passion but there just wasn’t?! I dunno. Still feeling pretty meh about that ship. >_<”Can you love a murderer?“I might ask the same.”Hanne hesitated. “And can you love me in this body?”“It is your heart I love. You know that, don’t you?”Genya & David:”You will sit yourself down and let me make sure you don’t have a concussion. Then you will have a cup of tea. And then, if I’m feeling generous, you can talk to David about things that explode.”“You do realize I’m the king?”“Do you?”Nikolai looked to David for help, but David just shrugged. “I don’t argue with my wife when she’s right.”All I can say to that is: LEIGH WHY????!!!!! WHY???!!! WHY??!! I don’t get it! Why did David of all people have to die?! Genya suffered so much already and now you take the love of her life?! David’s death was at least as needless as Matthias’s death and I don’t know why Leigh insists on killing off sweet and gentle characters!! I will never be okay with that... Never!!! T_T *cries an ocean full of tears* Genya and David would have deserved to be happy. T_T I can’t say more than that....Conclusion:Despite being in one hell of a reading slump when I started to read“Rule of Wolves”I really enjoyed the book once I got out of my slump and actually picked it up. The characters are all close to my heart and I adore them so much. Still, there was a lot of lost potential and I just couldn’t overlook it. I mean yes, when it comes down to it, the book was still amazing and enjoyable to read, I just would have wished for a little bit more when it came to certain characters and their development/character arc. All told, this was still a fun ride and if you loved the Grisha trilogy and “Six of Crows” you’ll definitely like this one as well._______________________________Okay, as it seems""past-me""was super optimistic.Did I really think I’d read this around Christmas 2020? *lol*Oh well, August 2021 is just a year later. And we’re getting closer to Christmas again... Christmas 2021, I might add. ;-PAnyway! I can’t wait to find out what’s going to happen with Zoyalai and Nina!Also I can’t even imagine how Leigh wants to wrap up this story with just one book but hey, that’s why I’m here to find out. XDSo bring it on, Leigh! I’m ready!___________________________How come we've aNAME,COVER,and even a freaking PUBLICATION DATE??!!How could I miss this? O_oGuess it's about time I read the first book soon!(in my case this probably means I'll get to it around Christmas! *lol*)Let's hope I'm not right with that prediction... but you know, the struggle is real!!Too many great books, too little time to read them!

A Tempest of Tea,"This is a fairly interesting concept with what I believe is a genuinely poor execution. The whole book feels unpolished. (This review is going to sound like I hate it, but really I'm mostly apathetic and once my frustration wears off I doubt I'll think of it much.)I loved the Sands of Arawiya duology so this was one of my most anticipated releases of the year, and now that I've read it I can firmly say, well...it's a book.This was a frustrating read. It constantly treats the reader like you're stupid, refusing to allow you to come to a single conclusion on your own and never trusting you to understand what's going on in the plot or emotionally with the characters. The sheer amount of overexplaining happening here had me doing a lot of ""I KNOW, you don't need to tell me that!"" It's not even just a matter of ""show, don't tell,"" it's that the text oftenwouldshow, and then just in case you didn't pick up on the very obvious thing it was showing you it would explicitly tell you too. Please, trust that readers can pick up on very obvious signs of sarcasm, emotional reactions, and plot connections.Tempest is a heist novel and unfortunately I just don't think the heist is very good. Solutions are entirely too convenient, these characters we're supposed to believe are so smart and cunning that they can plan a heist in the most protected whatever-it-is make outrageously stupid mistakes that seriously undermine confidence in their ability to do any of this, and as always I simply cannot take seriously that these children are somehow renowned criminals respected and feared by actual adults. I would love to see a YA Heist novel like this that actually factors in that the characters are teenagers instead of expecting the reader to ignore that and pretend like it's totally normal that they're in these positions and no one questions their age. There is no reason why grown adults should be deferring to these teenagers other than the text telling me that they're definitely very well established and very successful criminals. Cool, show me some evidence of that.The characters hold a lot of potential but because the book is so dead set on explaining every single interaction, there's never a chance to actually settle into a scene with them. This is especially prevalent in the romantic plotlines, which the book focuses entirely too much on in contrast to the actual plot. It often feels like it's ticking off trope boxes for the sake of it and lacks any real tension or sweetness because everything is being spoonfed to the reader. One of my favorite tropes is present in this book, one that usually suckers me right in every time, and the fact that it did nothing for me really hits home that the reason successful tropes are successful isn't simply for the fact that the thing happens, it's what the author then has a chance to do with the characters in that moment, and I just don't think this book did anything great with them. There's never a chance for the reader to really connect with the character and the moment when the text is constantly telling you how you're supposed to be feeling. The scene should just evoke the feeling without the text holding my hand through the correct emotional response.The bizarre tie-in with Arthurian legend makes no sense and I believe is genuinely a detriment to the book. Maybe it will make sense later in the series, but I kept waiting for it here and it never did. The connection to the Sands of Arawiya books also feels completely unnecessary and weirdly convolutes the story. It was a fun little easter egg in the first mention but then it kept going and honestly I don't think it should have. It raises too many logistical questions the book doesn't have answers for, which is also a running theme in Tempest. The amount of times that something would be revealed/explained and my first reaction waswait a minute then how does...when it would open up a ton of questions it wants you to just not pay attention to, I guess. Quite a lot in this book feels like it wasn't entirely thought out and the reader is just supposed to accept things without questioning anything. Never ask an ""and then what"" question, because this book has no answers.And because the book holds your hand through every single piece of it, it's wildly predictable. Every twist and turn is seen a mile away and typically feels like waiting for the book to catch up to the thing it telegraphed a hundred or more pages ago. The pacing is off too, I was genuinely shocked to realize I was 40% through the book when I thought I was still in the beginning stages. There's a strange, jerky motion to the pacing where it doesn't move at all and then moves all at once and it was poorly balanced.As always, this three star review makes it sound like I completely hated it and I didn't. Really. I was just wildly apathetic and the most reactions it ever got out of me were being frustrated at the text. In the end it was on the lower end of a 3, but I can't find it in me to put it in the 2 level. It's not as bad as some others I've rated 2.5, so at a 3 it will stay.Very unlikely that I will be continuing this series, but we'll see if I've forgotten my frustration by the time the second book comes out.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59406549-a-tempest-of-tea,A Tempest of Tea.txt
Ruthless Vows,"**Winner of the 2024 Goodreads Choice Award for YA Fantasy**‘Perhaps we make our own magic with words,’ writes Rebecca Ross in a novel that shows the power of words to be a bright beacon that can push back even the darkness of a world ripped apart by warring gods and enchantments. A magic spell usually requires reciting an incantation and while we seal a marriage with a kiss the spoken vows are what unites us. Words are the closest thing to magic we have in this life andRuthless Vows, the second and concluding volume of Ross’ Letters of Enchantment series certainly champions the written word as a force of hope, courage, or even ‘a shield to protect me.’ Jumping in just days after the shocking conclusion toDivine Rivals,Ruthless Vowsbrings us a story of the strength, sorrow, sacrifice but also of love that can ‘burn with splendor’ and might be enough to bring an end to a vicious war writ large by divine forces, or are the immortal powers too great to contend with?Ruthless Vowsis an emotional labyrinth of twists and touching character development that effectively reverses the roles in its predecessor novel and guides it towards a shocking yet satisfying conclusion. This is a love story built on language as much as it is a love letter to language and it filled my heart with bliss to read this lovely second half of an epic adventure.‘The sun would continue setting and rising , the moon would persist in waxing and waning , the seasons would bloom and molt , and the war would still rage until one god or both fell to their grave.’Admittedly, I foundDivine Rivalsto be a stronger novel if we take each separately in their own context, thoughRuthless Vowsdoes bring a great conclusion to this tale while still leaving just enough to speculation to give our minds a reason to continue wrestling with these stories as if in perpetuity. It is once again framed around the charming and heartfelt romance between Iris and Kitt who’s ‘souls weren’t mirrors but complements, constellations that burned side by side’ that gives us a marvelously strong emotional handhold to weather the tumult and turmoil of the war raging across the narrative. Their love story is beautiful and pure and you can’t ask for a better pair of characters to root for. Especially when they deliver tender lines such as:‘May your hand be in mine, by sun and by night. Let our breaths twine and our blood become one, until our bones return to dust.’Essentially these books are two people thinking “wow the way you write stirs me into the blossoming of love” which is pretty charming and they fall for the mannerisms of the mind before they even know the poetry of the body. I love the union of language to be a bond that transcends the physical, and enjoy the beauty of the ideas ‘I would love to see your words catch fire with mine.’. But the language of love and epistolary romance is what drives this book and this is a book ‘for anyone who sought a different realm through a wardrobe door,’ as Ross writes, a book for those ‘who wrote a letter and is still waiting for a reply, Or who dreams of stories and bleeds words.’ Which is always something I can root for. Especially coupled with the framing that it is their words reaching out across space and time ‘that your words found me here, even in the darkness,’ and become an emotional compass to guide one another through the hardest moments. As if it was meant to be, cosmically ordained and bestowed upon them through their shared love of making the world more beautiful one perfect phrase after another. A feat they can only accomplish together. ‘[H]is best words emerged,’ Roman realizes, ‘when he was with her.’‘was only thinking how strange it is. To think how many people we cross paths with in our lives. How someone like me has found someone like you.’What logophile wouldn’t swoon, as many did in the first volume. And Here, however, the roles are reversed with Kitt uncertain who is writing to him—Iris using her middle name was a nice touch as it recalled Roman’s use of Carver but also fit her need for secrecy as this is war and loose lips sink ships as they say—and it manages to keep the romantic tension high without feeling recycled either as the dramatic events keep rolling in.‘Did you think I would let him steal this last moment from me? When I surrender only to you, take you in my hands and burn with you before the end comes?’WhileDivine Rivalswas more slow-burn character development,Ruthless Vowsreally hits the ground running through a more plot-driven narrative that is, admittedly, still sort of a slow-burn. Personally I prefer the interpersonal dramas over the war drama but this does drive towards a rather satisfying conclusion that pulls all the small threads from the first book into a brilliant and dynamic full picture. The book plays with a lot of dualities that really make the plot sing too, with Forrest and Kitt’s “condition” due to Dacre’s magic (no spoilers but the uneasiness about Forrest lends an uneasiness about Kitt that reminded me a bit of Peeta fromMockingjay), but also the duality of relationships like Iris/Roman, Forrest/Sarah or Attie/Tobias juxtaposed with the fallout from Dacre/Enva makes the reader contemplate how each is better together but always at the risk of collapse or tragedy.‘Keep writing. You will find the words you need to share. They are already within you, even in the shadows, hiding like jewels.’That duality extends further into the craft of the duology itself. You can’t have one without the other, which is why the novels hinge at such a cliff-hanger moment. You have to combine them for them to make their magic, like ingredients in a potion, like Roman and Iris. It is also perhaps why Iris seems the strongest character in the first and we stretch out in her head a bit more whereas in this volume it is more Roman’s struggle in his captive state and emotional turbulence to keep aloft.And, as this is a war novel, sacrifices will unfortunately befall our merry band of lovers. Though this also gives a necessary weight to the story and all the twists and tragedies make the pay-off land with a greater blow as Ross reminds us that war always comes at an all too great of cost. ‘I see the beauty in what has been but only because I have tasted both sorrow and joy in equal measures’ is a line just as applicable to the experience of reading this series. Ideally one should think of this as the second half of a story rather than a sequel and I’d be curious how this book would read if it were bound as one full volume. That said I think taking a bit of a break between them was beneficial for my own reading habits and I didn’t find this one quite as engaging so I took forever to read it, but it almost feels more like, say, how the recent Dune films are just two parts to a continuous story not a sequel. But I did like how this fleshed out the world, especially the magic realms. Though I also wish this had a map of Cambria. Who doesn’t love a good fantasy world map. Maps even come up. A lot.‘Tuck my words into your pocket. Let them be your armor.’For those who found the world building a bit flat in the first, rest assured a lot of the little ideas that pop up get much more grounding here. The enchanted buildings, for instance, play a larger role in this novel and have a rather well-executed explanation that makes sense to have saved until later. But as we get more detail about what we already know, we also discover the world is much more vast and layered than we initially thought as well. An intricate magic system around how the gods function and move about the works is unveiled and it threatens the Cambria as the characters know it as much as if reorders the readers own understanding of it.‘I would betray you a thousandfold for her.’While this is more a personal preference than a criticism, I did like the gods more when they were offstage and still potentially more metaphor than physical presence. Or even a halfway point may have been preferred, something like a Sauron that is menacing and omnipresent without having to interact much. Once we have Dacre moving through the text it was nice to have him humanzied but it also reduced his menace, sort of how Randall Flagg is more menacing as an idea than a character with flaws, foibles and finicky temperament in King’sThe Stand. Also Enva was cool but it was almost too little and too late with her character compared to Dacre. I did, however, really enjoy the way she shifts the closure of the story in ways that don’t need a sequel, though a prequel would be welcomed. Better yet short stories about the gods, who we learn more of but only get half histories. The overall ending was mostly satisfying if a bit predictable and aiming more for a happy ending instead of an emotional impact with a message, but it still managed to pull off both for the most part.‘I look forward to the next chapter. The one you will write in your story, as well as the one we write together.’Overall, I found the Letters of Enchantment duology to be a delightful time full of magic and marvel where the charming romance truly carried the weight brilliantly.Ruthless Vowsgets into some pretty intense territory with war crimes and and the fallout of choosing sides (Kitt’s story also enters some pretty gritty aspects of being caught between a rock and a hard place that has echoes ofKurt Vonnegut’s undercover broadcaster inMother Night). There’s some gripping tales of betrayal and cloak and dagger maneuvers as a war rages on and information is worth more than gold. I greatly enjoyed the importance of language too and how Ross shows the importance of journalism in framing conflict and how this can quickly be weaponized into propaganda. But most of all, I loved the love story that burns brightly in all the darkness. A fantastic read that is greater than the sum of its two parts, a moving story, and one I won’t soon forget.3.5/5‘Write me a story where there is no ending, kitt. write to me and fill my empty spaces.’",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/127280062-ruthless-vows,Ruthless Vows.txt
Mistborn: The Final Empire,"I have a Booktube channel now! Subscribe here:https://www.youtube.com/petrikleoHere it is, the beginning of the trilogy that sparked my love for reading fantasy novels.It’s been exactly one year ten months since I first joined Goodreads or started readingThe Final Empirefor the first time; it was on September 1st, 2016. There’s no doubt thatThe Final Empireis an extremely important book for me. It’s not easy for me to elaborate upon this; a cliché such as “I absolutely love this book” is not enough, and the reason behind the significance of this trilogy for me will have to be postponed until I’m done with rereadingThe Hero of Ages. The impact that this trilogy left on my life is immeasurable, and my life before and after I finished this trilogy for the first time is a different one from each other. I predict this will happen within a week or two from now, but for now, let’s talk aboutThe Final Empire, and why—even upon reread—it’s an absolutely incredible start to a trilogy.Picture:The Final Empireby breath-artThe Final Empireis the first book in Brandon Sanderson’s highly acclaimedMistborntrilogy. For a thousand years, the world has been ruled with an iron fist by the immortal emperor: Lord Ruler. The main plot of the book revolves around a rebellion to overthrow the lord ruler; this rebellion is built around a heist led by Kelsier, his team, and his newly found apprentice—Vin. I immensely enjoyed readingThe Final Empire; the first time I read this novel, I found the plot to be thoroughly engaging, relatable, and at times humorous due to the character’s camaraderie and banter. And I was also completely fascinated by the world-building and magic system that Sanderson has created here. On reread, all of these are still true, but there’s a new additional superb quality: all the foreshadowing and hints are now laid bare for me to see with the gift of hindsight.The Final Empire, on its own, works perfectly as a standalone, but trust me that there’s so much more to the story beyond this book. Everything you read here—even the mini details—played major parts in the upcoming sequels.""Plots behind plots, plans behind plans. There was always another secret.”Picture:Kelsier and Vinby GisAlmeidaWhere should I even begin with the wonderful characterizations? I guess I’ll start with Vin. I’ve read more than 200 books since the first time I finished reading this trilogy, and Vin—by the end of the trilogy—still stands strong as one of my favorite heroines of all time. This, of course, doesn’t mean that Vin was the only great character from the series; Kelsier, Sazed, Elend, and many other characters were so memorable as well. I can’t mention them all in this review because their greatness hasn’t occurred yet here. Ever since I read this book for the first time, I’ve heard from several readers that they found Vin to be incredibly emo and annoying; I disagree with this. Vin had a rough past. I think Sanderson did a great job in conveying Vin’s insecurity and emotions. Vin’s thoughts felt believable to me, and I found her character’s development to be amazing. She taught me that despite being betrayed and left behind countless times, it’s always okay—and better—to love and trust someone again rather than being alone. And then Kelsier taught me about the meaning of justice and hope; it’s not okay to stand still in the face of tyranny, oppression, and slavery.“Men rarely see their own actions as unjustified.”Sazed taught me that differences in faith can still lead to being respectful and kind towards each other’s beliefs.“Our belief is often strongest when it should be weakest. That is the nature of hope.”There were plenty of things to learn from the character’s actions in the book. But for now, I want to discuss the next highlight of the novel—and trilogy—itself: the magic system.The Final Empireintroduced us to Allomancy and Feruchemy. Honestly speaking, coming from a gaming and manga/anime background, I thought I would never encounter a magic system as good as the one often told in these two mediums within a novel format. However, I was proven wrong. Allomancy is amazing, and it’s still by far my favorite magic system in the entire fantasy genre. Yes, I think it’s even better than the one shown in Sanderson’s magnum opus—The Stormlight Archive—so far. The intricacy of the magic system that Sanderson has crafted inMistborn Saganever ceased to amaze me, and I’ve yet to encounter a more engaging, complex, and amazingly easy-to-understand magic system in any other fantasy novels. Plus, the actions spawned from the magic system resulted in some incredibly vivid and fast-paced battle sequences.This book was also my first encounter with Sanderson’s spectacular world-building. Accompanied with Sanderson’s accessible, vivid, and immersive prose, the world of Scadrial that’s clouded by ash and surrounded by mist felt extremely atmospheric to read. There was also a lot of well-built mystery and lore within this book; Sanderson used the epigraph at the beginning of each chapter masterfully. I’ve heard a lot of criticisms from several readers that Sanderson’s prose can be a bit too simple to their liking, and I can certainly agree that—not only this book—all of his books contain simplistic prose. However, that’s actually one of the things that I appreciate about his works. His writings never get in the way of the story, and he’s brilliantly capable of telling a story of epic proportion with his accessible writing style. And this doesn’t mean that the narrative is lacking in wisdom or impact. In my opinion, all of Sanderson’s books in theCosmereuniverse contained a lot of relatable wisdom easily applicable to our daily life. A few examples:“The right belief is like a good cloak, I think. If it fits you well, it keeps you warm and safe. The wrong fit however, can suffocate.”or this“You should try not to talk so much, friend. You'll sound far less stupid that way”And with that quote, I realized that it’s time for me to put an end to my review here. It’s safe to say that I still considerThe Final Empireas one of my favorite books and one of my favorite starts to a trilogy. My reread experience of this book has been better than I expected, and I can’t wait to see how the rest of the trilogy will hold up for me. Below here—just for fun, cringe, and nostalgia factors—is the first review I’ve ever written. Hopefully, I did a better job this time! :)You can order the book from:Book Depository (Free shipping)You can findthisand the rest of my reviews atNovel NotionsSpecial thanks to my Patrons onPatreonfor giving me extra support towards my passion for reading and reviewing!My Patrons: Alfred, Alya, Annabeth, Ben, Blaise, Devin, Diana, Dylan, Edward, Ellen, Gary, Hamad, Helen, Jimmy Nutts, Joie, Luis, Lufi, Melinda, Mike, Miracle, Nicholas, Sarah, Seth, Shaad, Summer, Wendy, Zoe.------------------------My first review on Goodreads and I'm really happy it's this book that I chose. The book have an amazing world-building, great characters development and most of all, very intricate magic system and actions. This is coming from someone who've seen plenty of magics (not real of course) from 20 years of gaming and watching anime/movie/television series. The amount of details Sanderson put into each words (not to mention it's really simple and easy to understand) is insane.I will definitely read the rest of the trilogy straight after this and more works by him!",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68428.Mistborn,Mistborn The Final Empire.txt
Legendborn,"“Don’t make your life about the loss. Make it about the love.”~Rating- 1.25 stars~(Content/ Trigger Warnings)-Mention of most of these in the review-Legendborn,byTracy Deonnis the first book in theLegendbornseries.This was a book I was hoping to enjoy and adore due to all the hype, but sadly I did not like it and was disappointed.Before I explainwhyI disliked the book, I wanted to emphasize what I loved. I loved the portrayal of grief with the main character Bree and the representation in the book. Bree was a very compelling main character to read about. I also loved the writing style, and I have an entire google doc full of annotated notes.However as a whole, I did not like this book and I want to talk about why. I understand why this is so well loved, but this is my personal opinion so please do not hate on me for it.""Some truths only tragedy can teach. The first one I learned is that when people acknowledge your pain, they want your pain to acknowledge them back. They need to witness it in real time, or else you’re not doing your part.""Bree Matthews is grieving the death of her motherand wants nothing to do with her family memories or childhood home. A residential program for bright high schoolers at UNC–Chapel Hill is the perfect escape for Bree, untilshe witnesses a magical attackon her very first night at the campus. When a Merlin tries to erase Bree's memories of the night, it somehow doesn't work.“Typical anger can hinder or help. But the kind that burns in your gut? That’s fury. And fury is meant to be used.”Bree discovers thatthere is a secret society called Legendborn, which contains students who hunt demons down. Soon Bree recalls some of her memories regarding her mothers death were erased, andshe suspects her mothers death was more than just a car accident.Bree aims at finding the truth about her mothers death, and when the Legendborn reveal themselves as the descendants of King Arthur’s knights and explain that a magical war is coming, Bree has to decide how far she’ll go for the truth and whether she should use her magic to take the society down—or join the fight.“I’m a daughter whose mother was taken from her.Acceptance, I decide, is for people whose parents just died with no reason. True accidents or illness. Acceptance is not possible for murder.”The plot of the book is alright.My e-copy consisted of 630 pages (I could not find that edition) and it took around 250 pages for what was mentioned in the blurb to actually start happening. In fact, I'd consider the blurb and my plot summary to be a minor spoiler because of this, but there wasn't another way to explain the plot.""Where do we begin?""""At the beginning.""I foundthe plotto be slow and the pacing in some parts of the book was slightly off.While the beginning was very interesting, the mystery behind Bree's mothers death couldn't hold my attention for long.The middle was even more slow, where the plot was not progressing in any way. Although the plot's main focus was still finding the truth of Bree's mothers death, I felt it wasn't a strong enough storyline for a 630 page book.“Love is a powerful thing, more powerful than blood, although both run through us like a river.”This book felt likeThe Mortal InstrumentsmeetsThe Hunger Gamesin some ways (apologies for the comparison to two white books, I only meant some common tropes were similar), but I think Bree is a very different character than Clary and Katniss andthis book can still stand on its own without the comparison.Even then, I enjoyed both of those series a lot more than this book, as those books had a stronger plot thanLegendborn.“And then I’m in the air, leaving the earth and trees far behind me.”There were some plot twists in this book which were well written, and were foreshadowed, but unfortunately they didn't have much of an impact on me as I wasn't invested enough in anything that was happening. The ending was great, and I am hoping the sequel would be a better read.“But when your entire world is shattering, a little bit of magic is… nothing.”The entireworld buildingof this book comprised of info-dumping. I am still confused about the world and everything went over my head. While I always despise info-dumping, I can tolerate it in small doses.This book has pages upon pages of information that is dumped on us.At one point in the book, 10 pages of the world and how it functions is explained. That is too much for me to excuse.A lot of words like'Shadowborn'and'Onceborn'are capitalized throughout the book, and I still do not know what they mean. Usually in fantasy books where the main character is new to the world, we understand the world along with the main character. But in this case,Bree seemed to understand everything about the world instantly, while I was completely confused.I am sad I missed out on it, as I actually felt the world was properly thought over.Though I am not that well-versed inthe King Arthur legend,I liked the concept of the book and the new take on it. It was refreshing to see.“I don’t cry for my mother’s death. Or for myself. I cry because these strangers in the hospital—the nurse, the doctor, the police officer—don’t know my mother, and yet they were closest to her when she died. And when your people die, you have to listen to strangers speak your nightmare into existence.”I really appreciatedthe writing.As I said before, Bree's grief was so well written. Her pain was raw and it really hit home. The rest of the writing was good as well, and for a debut novel I think it was incredible. I am looking forward to reading more books byTracy Deonn.There were some things that I didn't like about the writing, namely all the flashback and memory scenes.While I think they were impactful, 1st person flashback and memories do not work for me. I like it more it in 3rd person, but that is just a personal preference.I am being very nitpicky, but we also have""I release the breath I’d been holding"", which is better than the classic'I let out a breath I didn't know I'd been holding', but I am finding this sentence or variations of in every other YA book I am reading these days. To each to to their own, I suppose, though I want to know if I was the only one who was annoyed by this.“Who’s the literary nerd? The quoter or the one who recognizes the quote?”The characters of this book were ok.Bree was definitely the most well developed, but I didn't really like the rest of the characters. I wish the book focused a little more on the side-characters as even though they played a role in this book, they mostly faded into the background.◙ Bree Mathews“My father says focus is death’s most precious gift.”“Death doesn’t give gifts.”Bree is definitely one of the best first person perspectives I've read in YA.I liked her POV a lot. She is fierce and brave and doesn't let anything break her. Her determination to find out the truth about her mothers death and her love for her mother was beautiful to see.“Because death breaks our connection! I want to scream. Death is not a thread. It is the sharp cut that severs us. Death separates us from one another, and yet it holds us close. As deeply as we hate it, it loves us more”I like that even though she is strong, she still has her flaws. Bree is an actual strong female protagonist, and I wish we see more characters like her in books.“For the first time, I wonder if maybe Sel’s right and I am born of shadows. Or maybe those shadows aren’t who I am, but I keep finding my way to them anyway.”◙ Selwyn KaneSel was an intriguing character. I wasn't interested in him in the beginning but as we got to know more about him I liked him more.“He can’t be more than eighteen, but something about his features doesn’t belong to a teenager—the cut of his jaw, the line of his nose. His stillness.”He is a typical‘brooding love-interest with a tragic past’, a trope that I am sadly sick of reading. Either way, he wasn't completely bad.◙ Nick DavisI liked Nick a lot more than I liked Sel. I found his character to be a bit more relatable.“This boy is not part of the plan. Not the beginning, middle, or anywhere in between.”He also fits the'goofy, sweet male love interest'stereotype, but this is a trope I actually don't mind seeing in books. I am curious to see where his arc goes.“How does this boy navigate my emotions like a seasoned sailor, finding the clear skies and bringing them closer, when all I seem able to do is hold fast to the storms?”The romance of the book was nice.The love triangle is definitely unnecessary, but for once its not completely obvious who the main character will end up with. I do not mind if Bree ends with Nick or Sel, but then again I am unfortunately not that invested to really care.“You’re not a damsel to me, Bree. You’re a warrior. You’re strong and you’re beautiful and you’re brilliant and brave.”I must say thatthe romance was very insta-lovey,and not just in the'i-love-you-even-though-i-met-you-days-ago'way, but more like the'i-will-do-anything-to-protect-you-and-even-give-up-my-life-for-you-because-i-love-you-so-much-even-though-i-met-you-days-ago'way which is more annoying and also a bit unrealistic. There is a reason for this provided in the end, but its still insta-love in my eyes. However, I still liked it a bit and thought it was sweet.“You are remarkable.”In short,Legendbornwas a read that did not work for me primarily due to the amount of YA clichés it had.This book had all the tropes and things in books I personally hate-love triangles, insta-love, info-dumping, flashbacks and memories in first person, side-characters that fade in the background, lack of focus on platonic friendships, brooding male love interest with a tragic past, etc- all combined in one, which took away my enjoyment.But apart from this, it also has great powerful portrayal of grief, a strong black female protagonist and great writing.I would recommend it if you can look past the tropes. (Edit-17/10/2022:, I realized I didn't mention this before so I'm adding an edit, but I absolutely acknowledge that while these tropes common in white cishet non-disabled stories, they are still lacking in books with BIPOC, LGBTQIAP+ and disability rep, and I do not intend to dispute that in my review at all.)“Growing up Black in the South, it’s pretty common to find yourself in old places that just… weren’t made for you. Maybe it’s a building, a historic district, or a street. Some space that was originally built for white people and white people only, and you just have to hold that knowledge while going about your business. (...) You gain an awareness. Learn to hear the low buzzing sound of exclusion. A sound that says, We didn’t build this for you. We built it for us.

Her life turns upside down when her stepmother curses her and her brothers. She is separated from her family, struggles alone in an unknown place, and is now determined to find her brothers. She has become selfless throughout the months, and her character development is something I came to love in this book. I wished I could give her a tight hug for all the pain she had to go through🥺🫂❤️‍🩹“Emuri’en, be kind. Let us survive the trials that await us. Don’t knot our threads together, only to sever them.”Takkan~lord of Iro, betrothed to Shiori, a thorough gentleman, a man of his words and down-to-earth person. He is an artist, and a storyteller (he might have written many stories in form of letters to Shiori which she never read🤭) He never gave up on finding Shiori🤧 He protects Lina aka Shiori without knowing she is the princess. I love him so much and can't wait to see him in the next book😩💘“I would tell you stories from dawn to dusk if it meant filling your eyes with happiness.”“I’m bound to you first. I always have been.”“I would not have you be alone, Lina, not in your joys or your sorrows. I would wish your strand knotted to mine, always.”Raikama~aka'the Nameless Queen', is the most misunderstood villain of this book. She is the type where you hate in the beginning due to the things she does to Shiori and her brothers, but in the end, you can't help but love her. She deserved better😭💔 I would be lying if I said I didn't cry towards the end of the book.“Your curiosity will be the doom of you one day, little one.”“I wanted to give you memories of your mother. Memories that would make you smile, even when you came to despise me.”“You are my daughter, not of my blood, but of my heart.”“Learn from my mistakes, and learn from my joys. Surround yourself with those who’ll love you always, through your mistakes and your faults. Make a family that will find you more beautiful every day, even when your hair is white with age. Be the light that makes someone’s lantern shine.”Kiki~the paper bird who was given life by Shiori through magic, is her guide/companion/friend bird. I wish I had magic to get a kiki too🤧 She was brutally honest every time, makes the funniest remarks, gives wise advice even tho it's just a paper bird, and protects Shiori. If it wasn't for kiki's friendship, I don't think Shiori would have survived those months. All the more why she is the most favorite character for me from this book😍“Generous of Radish Boy. I’m starting to like him already.”“Suit yourself. All I’m saying is, he doesn’t seem quite like the barbarian you pictured.”“Do you want me to poke her eyes out for you?”“When you die, I die. If you’re not afraid, I won’t be either. I’ll stay with you to the end, Shiori.”“Ignorant brute, I’d pay good gold to see his face when you tell him who you really are.”Side characters I loved the most: Kiki (the wisest paperbird😇), Megari (the cutest😍, takkan's little sister), and Seryu (the jealous dragon🐉🤭)Side characters I loathed the most: Hasege and Zairena💀🔪❥ 𝓢𝓸𝓶𝓮 𝓸𝓯 𝓶𝔂 𝓯𝓪𝓿 𝓶𝓸𝓶𝓮𝓷𝓽𝓼 𝓸𝓯 𝓢𝓱𝓲𝓸𝓻𝓲𝓣𝓪𝓴𝓴𝓪𝓷💞~“I owe you my life, from now on, Lina is my guest here, free to come and go as she pleases.”“I’m glad I finally met you, Shiori’anma.”“I wish you would speak to me, sometimes, the way you move your lips, I swear that you can. Even if I’m wrong, I wish I could at least see your eyes.”“Just know that I care about you, Lina. I couldn’t be there for Shiori, but I will be there—for you. Whether you need me or not.”“You almost got yourself killed, rushing into the fire like that.”“I would do it again without hesitation. To hear your voice. To finally see your eyes.”“What are you doing?”“What does it look like? I’m coming with you.”“I don’t—”“You can’t expect to steal my horse and take off without me. Besides, I have a story I think you may like.”“If you think that there is anything you could say to dissuade me from coming with you, then you are sorely mistaken.”“But the demons—”“Would have to rip me from your side. I’m afraid you are stuck with me, Shiori, even if you don’t ever wish to marry me. I pledge to protect you.”“You know, you’re even bolder when you can speak, Princess Shiori.”“I have many months to make up for.”“The odds of death were high, but not assured.”“You courageous fool.”“If that’s what you call me now, rather than ‘that barbarian lord of the third rank’ —then it was well worth it.”“My brothers aren’t going to put you in the dungeon for giving me a hug,”“I know, I only worry that I won’t want to let you go.”ˏˋ°•*⁀➷・❥・𝒫𝓇𝑒𝓋𝒾𝑒𝓌・❥・ˏˋ°•*⁀➷⛄02/10/24My thoughts are too mixed up, RTC soon💌it's a crime there is no crane emoji⛄02/02/24Not me doing another br now🙈 I don't think I'll finish my current read anytime soon🤸🏻‍♀️Doing this br with ma prettiestlila🥰💘lila said it's good, so I'm trusting her, because if we suffer, we suffer together🤭",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53457092-six-crimson-cranes,Six Crimson Cranes.txt
The Stolen Heir,"2nd readNew rating: 4 starsI reread this as a memory boost before reading The Prisoner's Throne, and not only do I remember a lot more now, but I also enjoyed it quite a lot more! The first time I read this I was in a horrible mood, which deeply effected my reading experience, if you can't tell by the atrocious review below, but I am so glad I liked this more!Still mainly reading the next book for Jurdan though<><><><><><><><><>“Another girl might have frozen, but I am cold all the way through.”I already know that this is going to be my most disappointing book of the year. If you know me or have at least seen some of my pre-book updates, you know how obsessive I was over this book, and I was freaking out over every single little detail. I LITERALLY CRIED WHEN I DIDN'T GET THE BOOK IN THE MAIL WHEN I WAS SUPPOSED TO (to be fair, I wasn't in the best place before that and not getting the book just made it even worse).and now I feel like a fool.What may have also impacted my reading experience was that I wasn't going through the best time while reading this, my mental health I guess you could say, wasn't doing good and that greatly affected my experience, pushing me into a reading/mental slump. I'd put it off for a bit and read a few comfort reads, which did help me. I don't think I'm all the way out of the slump, because I have no desire to pick up a book right now, but at least it was enough to finish this book.what also added to the fact was that I ADORED The Folk of the Air, and this was definitely not TFotA. I kept comparing the two books, which I knew I shouldn't have been doing but I couldn't help it. I couldn't get over Jurdan or the world or the plot.And then there was theactualbook that caused me to dislike it.The PlotI think another factor that put me into the slump was the pacing. The beginning of this book just felt really slow- this is a traveling book which I typically have mixed feelings about because I like concrete settings and characters, and it really annoyed me in this one, which led into me having a slump.The things that I did love though were the mentions of Cardan and Jude- those few moments gave me life and I'm so excited to see them in the next book (yes, I am reading the next book because I want to read about Jude and Cardan so badly and I am a little curious about what happens)Thankfully I got back into the book like over halfway through, and the plot began to pick up a little bit, and the middle to end was wild.I'm also unsure how I feel about that ending. I'm kind of mad, because I was hoping it would save the book for me but it didn't. It just made me not like a certain character which is disappointing, because I already feel indifferent to the characters, which is also very disappointing.“It is hard to explain the savagery of hope.”The CharactersI miss Jude and Cardan beyond belief.I cannot picture Oak as a seventeen year old, I literally can't. And please don't remind me about his goat legs. I can excuse the horns, but the goat legs?? I loved Cardan's tail, but goat legs I just cannot imagine. I don't want to imagine them. But anyways, I kind of liked him I guess. He was cute at times, while other times he was really mysterious and you could tell Cardan taught him a few things. I honestly can't even think of a time he annoyed me, nor actually of a time he made me smile. I'd rather have a character who makes me mad than a character I feel nothing towards. GIVE ME CARDAN BACKI am also completely indifferent towards Suren/Wren. She does have a personality, an interesting one at that, but she also annoyed me, which I suppose is better than feeling nothing. The ending especially made me want to scream- she's bloodthirsty sure, but she can NEVER beat Jude. NO ONE beats Jude. I was so angry with her at the end that it literally ruined it for me, which is because I'm an extreme moodreader and let my emotions control me way too much. I must admit though, I felt terrible for her at times. What she had to go through was something no one should ever have to go through.I know nothing about Tiernan or Hyacinthe or whatever their names are, so I don't know what to say about those two.“The Folk adore Cardan, and they’re terrified of my sister, two excellent things. I hope they rule Elfhame for years and then pass it down to one of a dozen offspring. No need for me to be involved.”😭😭 Cardan and Jude >>>>>The RomanceNothing in the entire world will ever beat Cardan and Jude. You're probably thinking ""Avery, stop comparing the two, they aren't supposed to be alike!!"" and to that I say, I cannot stop myself and I honestly do not care anymore 😊But seriously, I feel like Wren and Oak didn't have much chemistry when they first kissed. Like, I felt no spark, nothing, zero zip nada. I really, really wish I could've loved them because I want to be invested in their relationship, especially after what happened at the end, but I literally cannot if I don't feel the chemistry. They have their cute moments, but I wanted so muchmore.Cardan and Jude were much more developed, mainly because they didn't kiss until much later but in this I couldn't really feel anything, like the flashbacks did nothing for me because I didn't care, which is upsetting.But anyways, I'm going to go cry into oblivion because I feel like a fool and I hate that I disliked this and now writing this out I want to rate the book lower because I realized that I like it much less than I thought I did. I'm so disappointed, especially since it's also my fault for not liking this because of my stupid head and brain, and I honestly hate myself for it.2.8 stars“Sometimes life gives us the terrible gift of our own wishes come true.”<><><><><><><><><>honestly? i'm just glad it's over. and right now, i'm not even sad, i'm annoyed. i'd been hyped up for this book for MONTHS, and here i am, rating it 3 stars, which in my system isn't a high ratingthis book put me into an awful reading slump that caused me to have to read TWO of my favorite rom-coms, not even just one.rtc<><><><><><><><><>Haha guess who lied about the final edit edit: i finally have the book and i'm terrified i'm going to ruin it for myself because i can't get over Jurdan what's wrong with me 😭FINAL EDIT: HAPPY RELEASE DAY AHH. MY BOOK BETTER GET HERE SUPER FAST BECAUSE I WANT TO READ IT SO BADLY. I JUST WANT JURDAN MENTIONS PLEASEEE 🥳🥳 and yes I did stay up until midnight just to type this out right when it's the 3rd.Edit again again: I just read the exclusive first chapter for this and oh my gosh. Also I heard Jurdan doesn't show up till book 2?? I can't wait until the second book ughh. Also I heard something about a Jurdan baby??? Don't take this from me, I've just heard it around. I'm unsure how I feel about it. On one hand, I don't think Cardan and Jude would have a baby. On the other....I wouldn't mind it if they did. I don't know lolEdit edit: did y'all see the quotes that have been posted online?? I'm even more excitedEdit again: I just realized Taryn's kid is gonna be in this. I don't know how to feel about this. BUT I NEED MORE JURDAN PLEASEEEE I'M MAINLY COMING FOR JURDAN😍😍😍😍😍😍Edit: OMG There's a cover!! <33OMG, I AM FREAKING OUT. WE GET MORE ELFHAME, MORE OAK, AND I BEG OF YOU, PLEASE TELL ME THAT THERE WILL BE CARDAN AND JUDE APPEARANCES!!",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61198133-the-stolen-heir,The Stolen Heir.txt
How the King of Elfhame Learned to Hate Stories,"1.)The Cruel Prince★★★★★1.5)The Lost Sisters★★★★★2.)The Wicked King★★★★★3.)The Queen of Nothing★★★★★""Hate that was so bright and hot that it was the first thing that truly warmed him.""How the King of Elfhame Learned to Hate Storiesis an illustrated novella following Cardan Greenbriar, during many different stages in his life, while we slowly see all the different things that shaped him cruelly. The sound that left me when I opened this book and realized we were going to get present day with Jude from Cardan’s POV… be still, my hopes and dreams and heart.Rovina Cai’s art is truly so beautiful that it renders me speechless. I was already in love with her and her art because of her work withThe Wayward Childrenseries, but this entire book feels like am immersive work of art. From the perfect color palette, to the most perfect details, she executes the vibe of Cardan and his story in a way that I don’t think another artist could.In this story, Cardan’s life is very much impacted by a troll named Aslong who was wronged by Cardan’s father. She tells a story about a boy with a heart of stone, who finds himself in a predicament with a monster girl who won’t scare him away, until his heart starts beating again. And then all throughout his life, she tells his alternate versions of this same story, each version with a new meaning for a new version of Cardan himself.""She was the only real thing in a land of ghosts.""We also get to see so much of Cardan’s perspective duringThe Cruel Prince, much like we did with Tarryn inThe Lost Sisters, and it was everything. Nicasia and Locke have much wanted character development in this book, too, and I am literally on my knees begging for Holly to just give us the trilogy in Cardan’s complete point of view. But we see Nicasia being fostered on the land because her mother, Orlagh, Queen of the Undersea, wants to start putting pieces in motion. We get to see Locke, and his empty house and even emptier heart, teach Cardan the word “cruel” on every page. And these two, in addition to a prophecy looming over this young prince, are truly the first catalysts to this story and I was so in love seeing behind the scenes. And when Holly gives us Locke’s perspective one of these years…""Playing the villain was the only thing he’d ever really excelled at.""Each part, each mini story, we get to see Cardan questioning who he is and who he wants to be. Not to make this too deep, but Cardan very slowly realizes that he is not responsible for the terrible acts his family committed; both to him and to the people they ruled over. He struggles with his identity of a prince who should feel like he has everything, and a boy who feels like he has nothing. But seeing him finally understand that he deserves not only love but unconditional love? Him slowly appreciating that his heart can be warm and beat unapologetically? Truly some powerful stuff.On a personal note, I think most of you know that Holly Black is an author who means a lot to me. Her fae stories are what first got me into YA when I was young, and it really changed me as a reader and probably a human as well. I know most of you know that 2020 has been a hard year for everyone and everything, very much including my reading, so being able to curl up and read about my emotional support fae, from my emotional support author, just meant a lot to me. I truly think reading this book a day before release (bless youWaterstonesand my mail person) was the best reading experience I’ve had all year, and for that alone this book was probably the easiest five star I’ve given in a year of not a lot of five star reads.""Feels as though she has to earn the crown on her head over and over again.""Overall, this felt like the fairytale of my dreams. Cardan is my favorite character inThe Cruel Princeseries (or any of Holly’s books, I think) and this truly was such a magical, wonderous, unforgettable addition to this world. I am incredibly biased over this series because so much of my heart and nostalgia are wrapped up within this world, but I honestly think there is just so much to love on every page of this book. I feel blessed to read about each time Holly gives us a new book, and this will for sure be a favorite of mine for all of 2020. Lastly, I cannot believe we really got to read about Cardan going out for boba.Content & Trigger Warnings:abandonment, bullying, abuse, mention of drug use, humiliation, talk of cheating, and a lot of drinking.Blog|Instagram|Youtube|Ko-fi|Spotify|Twitch",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53439886-how-the-king-of-elfhame-learned-to-hate-stories,How the King of Elfhame Learned to Hate Stories.txt

Iron Widow,"Update:It hasn't happened to my knowledge, but here's a quick disclaimer: please do not send this review to the author. These are my own thoughts, on a book reviewing site, which are NOT meant for XJZ, and I don't claim to know any better than them - I'm just a clown on the Internet.Before I start the review in earnest, I want to make the following clear: this was one of my most anticipated new releases for 2021. I’ve been a fan of Xiran Jay Zhao and of their content ever since they reviewed the 2020 Disney live-actionMulan, and I was more than eager to read their debut novel, especially with several of my Goodreads friends getting ARCs and giving it all 5 stars. I went into this book in good faith and expecting to love it. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement, because I would have given this 2 stars… if it wasn’t for the last part of the book, which not only made the feminist message of the story come crashing down for me but also pissed me off, which made me lower my rating to 1 star. I’m writing the following in part to vent, but also because I’ve heard people who left critical and/or negative reviews of the book have been bullied, so I’d rather go into detail as to why this book didn’t work for me, and make it clear, to avoid getting unfair assumptions about me.With all that being said, I do encourage people to read their book and make up their own mind about it. A lot of people have appreciated it and even loved it, so it might just be a “it’s just not for me” kind of situation. I for myself will continue to engage with XJZ’s YouTube content since I’ve always enjoyed it, and I will give the next book in the series a go, since this was after all a debut novel and there’s a lot of potential for improvement. My rating would have been probably higher if this book had better editing and maybe an extra 100 pages, so I have good hopes I’ll enjoy the next book more.So, I’ll start with the positive right off the bat: the concept of a futuristic China with Imperial China aesthetics, where mechas fight evil aliens is extremely interesting. The visuals described made me really want to see an anime adaptation of this to be able to see it on screen. While it’s not a historical alternate universe of sorts, there are many Easter eggs regarding Chinese history and famous historical characters, which makes me want to research about them in earnest and learn more, which makes me appreciate XJZ’s excellent work in presenting them to us all the more. I also like the fact a positive and central representation of a F/M/M trouple has made its way into a YA book, even if they didn’t have nearly enough development, and while XJZ has received a lot of flack for doing so, to the point that it seems it was the reason why they stay away from Goodreads, I want to make it clear this was not my issue with the novel at all. This isn’t one of those reviews, and I will not tolerate any kind of comment that tries to bash the novel for that aspect.As I mentioned, the plot takes place in Huaxia, a futuristic Imperial China that’s under constant threat from the Hundans, a bunch of Evil Aliens from space, and that’s pretty much all you’ll ever know about those guys. Huaxia fights them using Chrysalises, basically “dead” Hundun mechas that are repurposed so Huaxia can have a fighting chance. However, in order for the Chrysalis to be piloted and since Huaxia is a misogynistic af society, since it works on a Yin and Yang basis and depending on the pilots’ level of “qi” (which, I guess you could say that’s this universe’s take on magic? It’s hard to explain because qi is never really explained properly apart from the fact it’s linked to the five Chinese elements), it needs a male pilot, but also a female pilot who’s more of a helper and who is referred to as a “concubine-pilot”. What happens more often than not is that during combat, the mental strain that comes from the concubine-pilots’ help is so strong that they die as a result of the effort. That leads to several problems regarding the worldbuilding, as I’ll enumerate below:-	Zetian herself mentions that there are population problems on the border, which the region where she comes from, since a lot of the girls are recruited to become concubine-pilots, which leads to a lot of boys remaining unmarried and gives way to population problems. That’s… literally mentioned once at the beginning, and is never brought up again. And keep in mind there are 329 active chrysalises at the time the story is happening, and pilots have several concubines assigned to them. We’re talking about thousands of girls who come and go. Which leads to me to wonder that sure, this is obviously a very misogynistic society, and yes, the families get a big compensation from their daughters becoming concubine-pilots and also another one when they die, but people *would* worry at such a threat being leveled at their communities’ survival, no matter how little they actually care about the girls’ wellbeing (which also depends on whether childbirth is as dangerous as it was in the past, which, again, would fit into the worldbuilding that we’re going for here, but I digress). And mind you, this isn’t Gilead where things are relatively recent and came thanks to a revolution, this is a system that has seemingly been going on uninterrupted for CENTURIES.-	Obviously, I’m not going to put into doubt the fact that a misogynistic society will view women as expendable, because that would be dumb, right? The concubine-pilots being viewed as expandable *does* make sense when you look at it at the surface level, and I get what was the intention, namely that it’s not so different from viewing women as wombs vs. using them as sacrifices to defeat the Hunduns, but given the aforementioned population problems, the last thing the government would want to do is give the population some incentive to revolt against the fact that they’re pretty much doomed to disappear? Especially since this misogynistic society, like so many others, outright declares that women are valuable in part because they bear children? All that to say, I can’t help but think there was a real missed opportunity to explore a new version of the Madonna/Whore complex, where dead concubine-pilots are glorified and presented as “saintly”, where all they did was getting their lives sucked out while the pilots they had to serve get to live and gather all the glory, which makes their glorification pretty pointless, in retrospect. Which would also give Zetian all the more incentive to rebel against that concept (i.e. “Yeah, that’s bullshit, my sister isn’t a saint, she’s just dead and those platitudes won’t bring her back”).-	So, with all that in mind, shouldn’t there be… some sort of criteria on whether someone becomes a concubine-pilot, and who ends up marrying to keep the population afloat? Something? Which, again, there are plenty of opportunities right there to highlight the rampant misogyny even more.(Also, maybe this is a cultural thing and I apologize for my ignorance, but the fact Zetian’s big sister is mentioned in name just *once*, that I don’t remember her name after all this and that Zetian only ever refers to her afterwards as “Big Sister” does make her feel a lot more nebulous than she should, which is kind of a problem given what the story’s message is about. Maybe it’s custom for older siblings in Chinese culture to be referred to as “Big Brother” or “Big Sister” rather than by their names, so if it’s the case, I apologize.)The story focuses on Wu Zetian, who’s an dystopian AU version of the famous Empress who was also the only woman in Imperial China to rule in her own name. In this novel, her incentive to become a concubine-pilot is to kill the guy (Yang Guang) behind her sister’s untimely death. Which, so far so good, except that while Zetian was planning to kill Guang the good ol’ fashion way of the stabbity-stab-stab, she ends up overpowering him while piloting, because she has a very high level of Qi compared to the pilot. The general belief in Huaxia is that all women have lower levels of qi than men, which goes on par with the misogynistic society it’s presented as. We discover later that the Chrysalises are rigged for them to drain the girls’ qi in order to spare the boys as much as possible (since Yang, the female counterpart in Yin-Yang, is considered “passive”), since girls in that society are viewed as expandable. That being said, that leads to the plot hole that Zetian is the only woman with a high enough level of qi to overcome that rigging, which leads to unfortunate implications, since that rolls on the principle that Zetian just wasn’t “passive” enough to get drained from her power, that being instance 1 of Zetian being “not like the other girls” (and I thought we’d all agree that trope was better left behind back in 2012?). Like, none of the girls with high levels of qi ever had anything close to survival instincts, if not feminist rage? Ever?On that note, where do Zetian’s feminist ideals even come from? Like it or not, people “are” influenced by their environment, whether they like it or not, which Zetian actually acknowledges at some point… except it’s of course to point that all women are brainwashed to be mean, vapid and stupid by the patriarchy, except for Zetian, apparently. Our heroine believes that women are as oppressed as they are not because they’re given very little chances of standing up without retribution thanks to the patriarchy, nope, they’re just basically too vapid and stupid to know what’s good for them, and that includes her own mother, who’s basically the walking stereotype of the battered wife and who, for all her shortcomings, *does* try to be a good mother for Zetian, except that leads to very little sympathy for her plight on Zetian’s side. And while I could understand Zetian hating her mother at the beginning of the story, she never comes to a realization that her mother is a victim just as much as so many other women are, and we’re even meant to realize that she had her own untimely death coming. It just reeks of victim-blaming, I’m sorry.Outside of her sister (who never has any development as a character beyond “she was kind and obedient, and she died”) and another concubine-pilot, Ma Xiuying (I’ll come back to her later), literally any woman Zetian meets ends up having actual catfights with her, for really petty reasons, and it’s always forced and contrived every time, because it’s the good ol’ “the patriarchy is a thing because women are too vapid and stupid to care lol” argument again. Even though, ironically, Ma Xiuying and another concubine-pilot by the name of Qieluo are much more complex female characters than Zetian ever is, not to mention they’re unironically the best characters in the whole book!I’ll admit I sighed in relief when Xiuying showed up – FINALLY, we’re getting the concept of sisterhood in this book! But I guess that was too good to be true, because Xiuying ends up “betraying” Zetian during the final battle, and when Zetian confronts her about it, she admits she did it because the lives of her 2 kids were threatened, and Zetian kills her… because I guess Xiuying should have put a girl she doesn’t even know that well before the lives of her kids? It doesn’t matter that they’re boys here, we’re talking about basic maternal instincts and no matter what the book wants me to believe, I’m pretty sure she would have done the same if her 2 kids were girls! And of course, Zetian goes “Lol, sucks to be you” and kills her, while thinking it’s a typical woman move (how *charming*, our feminist empress, people!) because I guess that whole thing can’t be used as an incentive to take over the government so Xiuying doesn’t ever have to betray someone in exchange for her kids’ safety.Oh yeah, and Zetian becomes Empress in the end because she manages to find the Chrysalis of the former Emperor (because she always needs Yishi, Shimin and now the Emperor to save her ass, #feminism), and she takes over Huaxia in full villain mode, killing her family so they’re not used against her like with Xiuying (and she has zero regrets or struggle with that), while Yishi who’s presented as the Soft Boy is fully enabling her and not having any objections about it or her methods.I can buy Zetian wanting to get at the top of the mountain despite her gender being a barrier for that, but what I don’t buy is her wanting to help other women at the same time, because given not only Zetian’s surroundings but also how she interacts with other women, it comes off as tacked on more than anything else. I find it interesting this book is based off The Handmaid’s Tale, because I’ll give Margaret Atwood this: the reason why her novel is as timeless as it is (and how, incidentally, the TV series did a very good job at developing) is because it takes care to present different types of women and how they react in the face of oppression. Yes, there are women who take advantage of the fact they’re as high as they can get to oppress other women (Serena Joy, Aunt Lydia), but there are also other women, like June, or Moira, or Emily, who stand up against the regime despite their circumstances being awful, and who support each other and other women no matter what.In Iron Widow, there’s none of that, unfortunately. All of this would have been better if Zetian was a Villain Protagonist, or if she was an Anti-Heroine who’s led to a darker path as the story advances. This is what I was expecting going into this book and I was looking forward to it – I’m not being harsher with Zetian on the basis of her being female at all! The problem is, we’re supposed to see Zetian’s vengeance, her anger, and her acts as righteous feminist fury, rather than the villain origin story that it actually is. And ultimately, that just makes Zetian’s feminist beliefs come off as… trite. Because she just hates everyone except her love interests. Her wanting to save women from an oppressive society ends up becoming an excuse for her own climb to power, and for all of her being angry at women becoming tools of the patriarchy in order to end up in a position where they can wield some sort of influence, you have to come to the unfortunate conclusion that the apple doesn’t fall that far from the tree.I will say, in conclusion to that part of the review, that I understand what XJZ was trying to do – there are some thoughts about how women are portrayed and how the public views them that have a lot of merit, for instance. I also think they intended to write a feminist revenge fantasy, which is a valid story, since some of my favorite films of all time are exactly that. However, I do think that they were trying to do too many things at once, which might have made them lose insight about certain aspects of the story and not think certain elements of it through, which sacrificed the nuance that is necessary to handle such themes. It’s also the reason why I can’t just dismiss it as a summer blockbuster flick with mechas, because this was clearly meant to be a serious book.I guess this is the point where I have to talk about the plot… which I don’t know how to do, because it was honestly all over the place, and it felt like a bunch of random events put together, so I’ll just go with the things that annoyed me.-	The prose… really reminded me ofThe Hunger Games. And not in a good way. Like, those inspirational quotes spread around still need a lot of work. And I never want to read the expression “nipple eyes” ever again. Ever.-	Also the character motivations are all over the place, with Zetian being the worst offender in that regard, but I’m not even going to go into everything because this review is like 3k words already-	So, Zetian becomes a viral sensation when she overpowers Guang, which, I *could* maybe buy, except that when people go in to see why Guang isn’t responding, Zetian basically comes out of the Chrysalis dragging his corpse, putting a foot on it, saying a badass line, and cackling like a maniac. Which sounds cool in theory, but when you remember that this is a very misogynistic society that will have her executed since you could very well say in court that she admitted to murdering the guy, that she’s perfectly fine with her entire family dying because of her (which, granted, she hates her family, including her mom who, as I said, does her best, but she doesn’t feel any remorse for that part of her plan once), and, most especially, THAT SHE FACES ZERO CONSEQUENCES FOR BEING SEEMINGLY RESPONSIBLE OF THE DEATH OF ONE OF THE BEST PILOTS, and not even used as some sort of example/cautionary tale, you really start putting the plot as a whole into question.-	Oh, and the reason why her big sister die? Guang just kills women for no reason. Which makes him a serial killer, basically, even if Zetian never calls him that specifically. Now, yes, there are serial killers and mass shooters out there who will specifically target women (the sad events at Polytechnique in Montreal come to mind), but it’s not treated with the gravity nor the attention such a serious issue warrants. It just feels like it was thrown in there for the sake of shock value.-	She meets Yishi again when… she’s being sexually assaulted by another pilot and he comes in just in time to save her. And yeah, it’s fucking pointless.-	I’ve mentioned it above, but the romance is unfortunately really underwhelming. So are the two love interests Yishi and Shimin, and there’s a problem when the story does more to make you sympathize with their plight (which I’m not trying to dismiss, by the way) than any female character that isn’t Zetian, especially when it’s supposed to be a feminist book.-	Oh, and the final plot twist everyone has been raving about? I actually said “I. Don’t. Care!” out loud when I read it. I was that annoyed.In conclusion, I will say once again that I’m not trying to discourage anyone from reading the book – as I said, a lot of people I know loved it and are giving it 5 stars, so it might just be a me thing. Go ahead, and make up your own mind about it, and hopefully you won’t be as angry about it as I am. As I said, I will give the next book a chance since the overall quality can only go up from here, and I sincerely hope it will.EDIT: The more I think about it, the more I wonder if the release of this book was rushed due to Xiran Jay Zhao going viral on the Internet and the publishers wanted to capitalize on their popularity as soon as possible. That does make me hope they'll spend more time on the next book given they're more ""established"" now, because as I said... I really don't see how this could get any worse, lol.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52459864-iron-widow,Iron Widow.txt
The Wicked King,"I hate this book.I hate it so much I can’t stop thinking about it. I hate it enough to wanna make 100 accounts to rate it one star over & over again.But I won’t, not because that’s immoral but becausethere can’t be hate unless there is love.There can’t be loss unless there is need. There can’t be hurt unless there is care.“I hate you,” I say, the words coming out like a caress. I say it again, over and over. A litany. An enchantment. A ward against what I really feel.So really, it’s my own damn fault.I all but handed Holly Black a gilded dagger, turned my back, and begged her toplease please stab me right in the feels, going so far as to give her directions to the place just south of my hopes and slightly north of my dreams.I am Jude and this book is myWicked King.And there is no better way, absolutely none, to convey how it feels to read its every page, every brush of ink, every curve and crease, than to quote the book itself:It has all the sinister pleasure of sneaking out of the house, all the revolting satisfaction of stealing. It reminds me of the moment before I slammed a blade through my hand, amazed at my own capacity for self-betrayal.(Please do excuse me for stealing lines—I do so because I am an inadequate piece of human soul and incapable of competing with the Faerie Queen who wrote this pure trove of gems).“Power is much easier to acquire than it is to hold on to.”I have said it before, and I’ll say it again: People don’t paint this series as it truly is.The Folk of the Airis not a light, romantic fairytale, however addictive; it’s a dark and deadly one—less a page-turner and more a temptress. It’s about tricks and snares, games and intrigue and pain and, above all else, power. Infectious, greedy, alluringpower.And that, all of that, weaves itself through every nook, around every thread of the books. It hugs Jude’s curves and flies from her lips, slides along Cardan’s tail and between his clever clasp. It wraps its hungry grasp around the characters, bathing, entombing, suffocating. And it, quite gloriously, circles the dynamics and bonds, twisting and blurring the lines of love and hate, want and fear, until it is one with its every angle, dip, and chip. I guess it makes sense some would mistake one for the other.Isak Danielson’s songPower(which you can find on mybook playlist) isThe Wicked Kingincarnate and why oh why didn’t I listen when people told me NOT to finish it before an exam and went ahead to do just that? Sigh, I’m a fool, yes, but a fool for Jude and Cardan. And that never ceases to be an honour.“Things are always super dramatic around here,” Vivi tells Heather. “Epic. Everyone acts as though they just stepped out of a murder ballad.”As I called this book apure trove of gems, I will proceed to refer to the treasures as the four most precious gemstones:Black Diamond:Jude Duarte“Once upon a time, there was a human girl stolen away by faeries, and because of that, she swore to destroy them.”I will fight every single person who dares call my Jude annoying or unbearable and anything else in the thesaurus for those adjectives. She is the definition of a brilliant badass queen and I am willing to rip throats to prove it. Metaphorically, of course.InThe Cruel Princeshe evolved from the girl who wanted to impress and fit in and fight for honour, to a ruthless, power-hungry, scheming star, and in this sequel her shine multiplies a thousandfold; so I suggest you all shield your eyes before you go blind from her magnificence.Exploring her hatred of vulnerability, her need for control, and her insistence on relentlessly pushing andpushingherself both physically and mentally to the brink of collapse until she’s achieved perfection and utter independence, made me relate to her on a level that bordered on discomfort, if comfort really had any meaning (at least to me) and I wasn’t such a self-absorbed bastard.The sheerwill. That, right there, is my most adored trait in human or faerie, reality or fiction.“You’re unwinding yourself like a spool. What happens when there’s no more thread?”“Then I spin more.”Anger or fear? Fear or anger?Jude would argue anger (unsurprisingly, that is, her being a furious hurricane and all) and I happen to agree. Both are overwhelming emotions that can drown and paralyse and turn one into a fool, while both can also motivate and embolden and turn one into a champion. However, there is a certain strand of arrogance interwoven with amger that fear happens to lack. And, you all know me, I would pick anger over fear any day.So I can do nothing less than shout my love for her from the rooftops, no mountains, asJude takes the hurt and weakness the Folk carved into her flesh and bone, adds it to the stew of her desire to be magic like them mixed with her obsessive knowledge of their rules and their ways and the music of their strings as they are pulled and plucked, and sprinkles it with a formidable amount of pleasure from the power and the dance and determination to learn and excel, watching it all bubble and burn.She is certainly my favourite cook, because she is better at being worse than them. Never, ever underestimate my little murderer’s strength, her skill at strategy, and her capacity for cruelty.Lastly, I want to raise a glass to the question Holly raises with this book:Is it good, or bad, for a ruler to contain those cutting, cunning impulses?Answer that as you will.Cat’s Eye Emerald:Cardan Greenbriar“Have you never heard that virtue is its own reward?” Cardan says pleasantly. “That’s because there’s no other reward in it.”Ahhhh, I am in love with this wicked king (while wanting to strangle him to death and back, ofc) and I’m not even sorry.I stand by my point in my review ofThe Cruel Princethat his most important difference from most wicked charming boys (or girls) in books, is hisabsolute lack of ambition.Hell, that’s also the main difference between him and Jude.This small (perhaps inconsequential to most fans) detail is so ridiculously highlighted for me because it makes him endearing and unique and helplessly adorable, adding to his irresistible charm as he languishes on life, andwhy am I swooning right now ugh.The Wicked Kingis undoubtedly the best installment in this trilogy and one of the reasons for that is Cardan’s beautiful, heart-stopping growth as a character. He goes from a person commited to, as Jude would put it, “being a layabout who does none of the real work of governance,” to finding himself, his resolve, mettle, fight—whatever you want to call it—because of how his feeling of powerlessness and fear trickle away, drip by drip, as he no longer has someone to inflame (Jude excluded). And, mostly, because of Jude pushing him unwittingly.He learns toownit.“The three of you have one solution to every problem. Murder. No key fits every lock.” Cardan gives us all a stern look, holding up a long-fingered hand with my stolen ruby ring still on one finger. “Someone tries to betray the High King, murder. Someone gives you a harsh look, murder. Someone disrespects you, murder. Someone ruins your laundry, murder.”I could go on for two more paragraphs about why he seems to “have a singular taste for women who threaten” him and why and how a certain type of power dynamic appeals to our dear twisted fearie as it, honestly, does to most of the messed up characters in this series, but I won’t bore you anymore with my psychological talk.I will just go ahead and carve a Cardan-shaped chamber deep in my cold, dark heart to trap this clever, cutting, shameless, straightforward yet playful boy and protect him at all costs.Burmese Ruby:The Jurdan Ship“If you’re the sickness, I suppose you can’t also be the cure.”I mean whoever wasn’t already abroad this ship should be careful because I might kindly push them overboard for being late to the party (let’s ignore the fact that I was also late to the general party shh).If book one was them warming up for the match, book two is them sparring at full swingand I am here for it.And “what is sparring but a game of strategy, played at speed?” So just as he is wary of her, bracing for her next blow while enjoying the game and trusting her completely, he is also going to land blows. Really, it’s only fair.“I have heard that for mortals, the feeling of falling in love is very like the feeling of fear. Your heart beats fast. Your senses are heightened. You grow light-headed, maybe even dizzy.”I think my second favourite aspect of their relationship (after the games and sparring match) is howtheir need and attraction and glimpse of a kindred spirit morphs into denial and fury and fiery hatred as they run away from the feeling they despise lacing through their love, all while being helpless to do so.Running at full speed on the tilted ground drenched with a rain of pain and desire, Cardan has already slipped. It’s Jude’s turn to do so.“Kiss me again,” he says, drunk and foolish. “Kiss me until I am sick of it.”Now, I’m going to make a confession. I was as stupefyingly petrified of their dynamic shifting as Jude was. Every step he took beyond her control, every claim he made to his own self, every fistful of power he dug up, I found myself screamingno nojust as much as I cheered his growth. Because I understand her fear of being out of control and powerless, and do not want him to hold more power than Jude. And that fear is idiotic and unfair, because the fact that one’s power should come out of another’s powerlessness needs to give everyone pause.He has capered while she schemed, it’s time for them to learn to be equals, with mutual trust even in their game of chess, having faith in the fact that their opponent and partner willnever land a killing blow.“For a moment,” he says, “I wondered if it wasn’t you shooting bolts at me.”I make a face at him. “And what made you decide it wasn’t?”He grins up at me. “They missed.”Violet Sapphire:Rest of the Rabble“Like the ant in the fable who labors in the dirt while the grasshopper sings the summer away.”“And has nothing left for winter,” I say.“I need for nothing,” he says, shaking his head, mock-mournful. “I am the Corn King, after all, to be sacrificed so little Oak can take my place in the spring.”✧Storytelling:I might’ve read only one trilogy byHolly Black, but I can safely say she is one true Weaver; taking the tale by the throat, dunking it in an ocean of vocabulary and punctuations, and threading the water and words into whorls of magic and enchantment. Thank you, Holly, for weaving waves of wailing tales for us.✧Worldbuilding:No words can capture and frame my love for this mystical, fairytaleish land of exotic, quiet allure, so I’m not even gonna try.“I’m still your father.”“You’re my father’s murderer,” I blurt out.“I can be both,” Madoc says, smiling, showing those teeth.✧Madoc:I could not tear my gaze away from this messed up father-daughter relationship. He, the monster who took everything from Jude, also gave her a new life, pushed her to her fullest potential (even while underestimating her), encouraged her fire (even while beating her down), was all is she had. And I lived for how thoroughly this facet of this dark tapestry, this theme of moving past and beyond the power of the person who raised you, burns throughout the book.P.S.Pain makes you strong? Sith much?“Your ridiculous family might be surprised to find that not everything is solved by murder,” Locke calls after me.“Wewouldbe surprised to find that,” I call back.✧Taryn the Betrayer:I argued in my review ofThe Lost Sistersthat Taryn likes the games and adventure and power play and is fierce enough to claim her own tale (while being hypocritical enough to deny it). And she does. But doesn’t mean she is not weak, because she is that, too. She escapes confrontation and discomfort like a sunflower constantly turning towards the sun to flee the darkness—and I’ve never much liked sunflowers. This adaptability is exactly what fascinates Locke, and this weakness is just what takes apart the trust between these two lost sisters.✧Locke the F***ing Fox:I know everyone hates and wants to kill this guy, but I can’t resist bringing him back to life after choking him for more of his playful, dangerous-but-fun fox games of backstabbing delight. *sheepish smile*“Revenge is sweet, but ice cream is sweeter.”✧Vivi the Humanlover:A moment’s appreciation for mt defiant yet chill, loving yet selfish knight-at-heart.✧Fala the Fool:Putting him here because NO ONE SEEMS TO CARE FOR THIS GEM WHY.

Chain of Iron,"My reviews of 'The Last Hours' trilogy:- Chain of Gold:⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐- Chain of Iron: ⭐⭐⭐⭐- Chain of Thorns:⭐3.75 rounding up to 4 stars- because apparently I'm too attached to the charaters and can't seem to bring myself rating the book lower than 4 stars.I think the title 'Chain of Iron' would have been more suiting if it were actually named: 'Chain of Miscommunications and Keeping Secrets'.Attention! This review includes:⁃	Spoilers⁃	Unpopular opinions⁃	Rant⁃	Me babbling over characters⁃	Fanarts⁃	And many moreWas this better or worse than Chain of Gold? Neither, because both of them are completely different from each other with different plot lines despite the characters being the same.But if I have to compare with 'The Infernal Devices' or rather 'Clockwork Prince' in this case (unpopular opinion time) I’d say this was better, yet again. TLH characters are behaving more like teenagers, obviously - because they're in fact are teenagers, meanwhile TID characters behaved like adults, and for me that is bothersome and a bit unrealistic to me.While I was going through my book and searching quotes that I kept tabs on, I realized that The Last Hours espeially Chain of Iron focuses so much on love and more romantic love as a matter of fact than other plotlines.Relationships:-Blackdale/Ghostwriter:I wanted to start off with these two, because they've become my ultimate OTP! Lucie and Jesse are literally Edwardian version of Romeo and Juliet (No! I'm not a fan of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet). Lucie and Jesse's romance was not rushed I see that a lot in reviews people find their relationship rushed or even toxic because of the age gap, which is only 7 years and in the 20th century that used to be normal, but we all know that Jesse is stuck at the age of 17, after his death he hasn't aged, at all. Don't forget that this book takes place 4 or 5 months after book 1 and in book 1 they slowly becoming fond of one another, plus in the past 4 or 5 months after the events of book 1 they hung out almost every night so naturally it was going to happen. It was them who had the best communication when it came to express their feelings towards one aother.-Gracetopher- (I know, they had literally one or two scenes together but I'm already shipping them): I Would love to see more development with Grace and Christopher together and as individuals, these two nerds has so much potential to become a couple. Not to mention I have a soft spot for science geek couples.-Jordelia:If only these two weren't stupid enough to realize that both parties are indeed madly in love with eah other. There are a lot of moments between these two that I found very swoon-worthy.''He is not yours. He is mine. He ismine.''Art by lita.fleurWhat I didn't like:- Elias’s death wasn’t discussed enough. I know he was not the best person and he kind of deserved that death, truthfully I didn't even bat an eye when he got murdered. But him dying felt as passive as the other unimportant Shadowhunters.- Cordelia needed to stand up more for Alastair. I mean she literally met the Merry Thieves gangand she chooses them over her own brother, just to ''please'' them. I really like Cordelia, but I found it horrible on her part that while Alastair did everything to protect his little sister and his families reputation ever since he was young and Cordelia seems so blind over his actions.Cordelia and Lucie's friendship, because I think this needed to be discussed:Cordelia and Lucie may not have been as close as they were in book 1 or as I was anticipating them to, but the friendship within the group is fantastic. It’s the kind of the friendship that everyone desires to have and experience at least once in their lifetime. It is also obvious both of them care deeply for one another, but it's understandable how they've grown apart from each other, since both of them are consumed with their own problems and secrets. I see that how many people blamed it on Lucie on how she is the one who ''ruined'' their friendship or the fact that they aren't as close as they used to due to her teaming up with Grace to resurrect Jesse, but that blame should be put as much on Cordelia, as well. Their Parabatai(to be)bond was a bit off and I guess I just don't like seeing female friendships getting ruined because of guys.I'm rooting for them to be better friends to one another and trust each other more in the final book. It has been their dream to be each other's Parabatais and I would hate to see if they keep more secrets from each other.“You cannot save people who do not want to be saved,"" said Magnus. ""You can only stand by their side and hope that when they wake and realize they need saving, you will be there to help them.”Characters I want to talk about a bit:-Alastair:He deserves someone that’ll truly love him and not mistreat him like Elias or Charles did. Now I do like him and Thomas together very much and they fit together, but Thomas in my opinion is still isn't comfortable enough with his sexuality and I don't want seeing Alastair getting hurt yet again. I started appreciating Alastair more in this book. When I read Chain of Gold for the first time I didn't pay much attention on him. However that changed entirely when I re-read the first book, now that I've read the second book as well he has easily become a favorite character of mine.-Grace:I know Grace is a disliked person and others portrayed her as being one of the villains of The Last Hours trilogy, but we have to look at her life from her own perspective and in a non judgmental way. I think Cassie made a great choice on adding Grace chapters in this book. I never hated Grace, neither in book 1. I always saw her as a complex character, I mean she has got to be one of the most well written and developed morally grey characters in YA literature. Her actions are understandable (yes, at times also dislikeable), she has been both emotionally and physically been abused ever since she was a little girl by a woman that hasn't even adopted but BOUGHT her!!!I think the best way to look at Grace's personality is to compare her to the Ying Yang sign; There's a little badness in every good person just as a little goodness in every evil character.-Ariadne:I wanted to see Ariadne/Kamala on her own when she wasn’t obsessing over Anna or wanting her to get back it’s like her entire arc revolved around Anna. I know she has a big room for more developement and I loved how in the end she ended her ''fling'' with Anna and chose herself for the first time. This does not mean I don't want Anna and Ariadne to be together. I just hated the direction both of them book relationship wise in this book.-Charles:I don't understand all the hate that Charles gets, I mean yes, he's annoying, and arrogant, but look at it this way: His entire life he wanted to be a politician and a part of the counsil, because Charlotte also inspired him. But he is in that period of time where being what he was was not acceptable and he has to hide by faking engagements and relationships with other women.-Tatiana:How petty and messed up can you get?! Just because once upon a time when you all were barely teenagers Will Herondale rejected you, you decide to turn your own kids against them? Even if I do a teeny tiny bit sorry for her, I don't see her redeemable at all. I hope she wouldn't survive in the last book, meaning: she dies in Chain of Thorns!-Lastly:I think we can all agree that the most unproblematic character was Oscar the Golden Retriever.“If I must fade,' he said, 'I would like to fade remembering this as my last waking dream.''Don't go,' she whispered. 'Hold on, for me. We are so close.'He touched her cheek. 'Only promise me one thing,' he said. 'If I do go, give us a happy ending, will you? In your book?''I don't believe in endings,' she said, but he only smiled at her, and faded slowly from view.”Art by lasq.draws“When I am with you, I imagine that my heart is beating, though it has not beaten for seven years. You give me so much, and I can give you nothing at all.”Love triangle/square:The entire James, Cordelia and Matthew love triangle has overshadowed the rest of TLH cast's romances, character arcs and developements. Most of them felt rushed because of that unnecessary love triangle.Unpopular opinion alert!!!I think if Cassie wanted to add a love triangle (since its her specialty) she should have done it between Matthew, Lucie and Jesse. That would have made much more sense. Since Matthew has been in love with Lucie or at least had a crush on her most of his life, even though she constantly rejected him, because she only sees him as ''brother'' or brother's best friend.While this trilogy till now mainly focuses on the love triangle between Matthew Cordelia and James and it is boring and there shouldn't have been a love triangle between those three in the first place, if anything it's a love square since Grace is included in it too, even if it's beacause of the bracelet, but both books began with Lucie so Lucie is once again being overlooked again despite having a major roll in one of the most important plot lines.Also a theory of mine is that Matthews and Lucie’s friendship/possible romance in the next book. Let's look at it this way, whenever someone asks Matthew about Lucie and where their friendship/relationship stands he always seems to find a way to change the subject on that matter. While I may be overthorizing everything, but I think this may be a future reference or foreshadowing to their relationship in the last book. I hope matthews feelings/crush he has/had for Lucie will be more explored because everytime someone speaks for that topic he somehow avoids it. That must mean something, right?“When you want something very much, you are willing to accept the shadow of that thing. Even if it is just a shadow.”Last chapter aka the most hateable chapter of all time:The last chapter was overly dramatic and anticlimactic, ridiculous yet angsty all at the same time . It was awful and I hated it.If the ending were only that James could catch Cordelia from the train, tells her about Lucie and how she has been kidnapped by Malcolm she would’ve left the train and go with James to save her future parabatai. And that way Matthew could've stayed in the train instead amd went to Paris on his own. I think he needed to figure all his feelings alone without any more drama near him. We all know Cordelia doesn't love him romantically nor she ever would, because for her it has always been James and no one else. So him going to Paris with Cordelia will only hurt him more.Here's the thing, Matthew was at wrong for doing what he did at the end, I don’t hate him and while Cordelia was at wrong here too. She was under a lot of pressure, she wanted to become an ideal daughter/wife, but at the end she saw that everyone disappointed her, so she decides to run away from all that, that was very understandable. But with your husband's parabatai? That was just plain stupid on her part.Art by Laira BlogEpilogue:When Belial saying Jesse has done an excellent job then he winced. I know I’m overthinking but why did he wince or does all of this have other secret meanings too? I love Jesse Blackthorn, he's so kind, caring and precious. However, there comes times, even when I read Chain of Gold for the first time that he's faking his friendship with Lucie and is using her, but the reality is that he's working with his mother and Bellial. I alway get the feeling that he somehow he would turn out to be a villain working along with his mother and Belial and has been using Lucie all along.Also, this is the second time that the epilogue ends with Belial and Tatiana. Obviously because they’re the main villains of this trilogy. But think about it, the Blackthorns are playing a major role in this trilogy it’s just that basically everyone is being overlooked because of the unnecessary love triangle between James, Cordelia and Matthew. I think the last book is going to focus more on Jesse, Grace and Tatiana. Not to mention that the title itself has the word Thorns in it and Jesse's pendant has thorns on it too plus their house was always surrounded with thorns.“...sometimes you cannot reconcile with someone else. Sometimes you have to find that reconciliation on your own. Someone who broke your heart is often not the person who can mend it.”In conclusion:Was this book flawless? Of course not! There were so many good moments as much as moments that made me angry. Although this doesn't need to sound too surprising, since it's the second books in series, especially if it's a trilogy. They (middle books) tend to be the most bizzare installement in the most bizzare way (and good and bad).The book itself didn’t blow me away. It was adversitied to be more scandalous and dramatic, but hey to me this was the perfect Jesse and Lucie book and I love them a little too much and if it weren’t for their sweet and overly tender moments together I don’t think I would’ve given this the rating that I gave, despite the fact that I enjoyed most of it, except the last chapter.While I do understand this doesn’t quite as good as the previous book, it keept me on the edge of the seat almost during the entire time. I myself am not the biggest Shadowhunters fanatic since I haven’t read the most important sagas, however, 'Chain of Iron' wasn’t as bad as I saw everyone was describing it.I don’t know how is Cassie going to be able to fit all of these characters’ plot lines into the last and final book and it’s going to be a humongous book for sure. I just hope she is going to give each and every single character their own time to shine and that there would be no plot holes.********************************************Did I finish this book or did the book finishme?!*****************************Am I...finally reading this book?

I mean there are so many details to observe. (But I’m tagging them as spoilers)Alright, here are my theories regarding the cover:⁃ The moths: I know they’re Grace’s favorite animal/insects, so maybe it’s represents Lucie’s alliance with Grace about resurrecting Jesse. Also moths may symbolize as bad omens? Which means Lucie will definitely be in so much danger.⁃ She’s holding Jesse’s locket. THE FREAKIN’ BLACKTHORN LOCKET!!!! Which means we get to see a lot of Jesse.⁃ The place on the cover looks like the forest where her and Jesse first met.⁃ It seems to me that she’s kind of floating. I’m 100% sure that she’ll explore and gets to know more about her powers and why she can see not just regular ghosts but every kind of them, I’m not sure about this but maybe she’ll have ghost-like abilities?⁃ Her rune is glowing. I don’t know much about the runes, but can it mean anything?⁃ Also, I can’t decide if her dress is yellow or golden, because if it’s golden... we all know what a golden dress is used for when it comes to shadowhunters. 😱😱That’s all I have to say about the cover for now, but oh boy am I terrified of what’ll happen in this book. Oh, and the synopsis has left me SHOOK!!!!!",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17699855-chain-of-iron,Chain of Iron.txt
The Last Olympian,"“Then up on Olympus,” I said, “when they wanted to make me a god and stuff, I kept thinking—”“Oh, you so wanted to.”“Well, maybe a little. But I didn’t, because I thought— I didn’t want things to stay the same for eternity, because things could always get better. And I was thinking…” My throat felt really dry.“Anyone in particular?” Annabeth asked, her voice soft.I looked over and saw that she was trying not to smile.“You’re laughing at me,” I complained.“I am not!”“You are so not making this easy.”Then she laughed for real, and she put her hands around my neck. “I am never, ever going to make things easy for you, Seaweed Brain. Get used to it.”If he doesn’t give up immorality for you, he isn’t worth it.But that’s beside the point.With that, the journey of Percy Jackson, Son of Poseidon, the series that started it all, concludes.In myreviewforThe Battle of the Labyrinth, I stated I was sure this would have a satisfying enough conclusion, and honestly, it was satisfyingenough.Emphasis on the enough. The ending was enough. There’s a happy ending (for now, of course). Percabeth is official, the trio is safe and sound (as they can be), the gods are rebuilding Olympus, and the world can rest. The execution, however, was not. Still, finally getting a hold of this series and witnessing different battles, twists and turns taking place, betrayals and traitors facing their consequences, friendships blossoming, love conquering, and an entire war of Mount Olympus versus the one who started it all, Kronos, has been thoroughly engaging. Despite my love for this series being quite mixed, with my favorite beingThe Titan's Curseand my least favorite beingThe Battle of the Labyrinth, I can confidently say there is no regret on starting this series now. I used to think you were too late to read a particular book or series, either due to one’s age or because the book is no longer “as popular,” but I don’t think it’s ever too late to start something. Just like they say it’s never too late to start a new hobby or have an interest in a new career, it’s never too late to start one of the greatest, most beloved, most popular, and best-selling books and series of all time.Even though I had no opportunity to read this when I was younger, the name of Percy Jackson never left my ear. Greek mythology was always associated with him throughout my peers and those close to me. Those who read or were a fan of this andHarry Potteralways mentioned it, and I was always envious of anyone who could grow up with these characters. Despite this, reading it now in my 20s, the journey has been a mixed bag, but it has been exhilarating. I’ve learned new things, new names, new places, new histories.It isn’t a surprise, and it’s nothing new, but my favorite character is Percy. His fatal flaw is so humbling and selfless, and it makes me root for him in every way. I think it can be challenging to create a character like Percy because you’re hoping for character development, and you’re hoping this flaw won’t get in the way of Percy becoming the hero he’s meant to be. I’d argue that, unfortunately, it does get in his way. That is why it is his fatal flaw. There are many moments of Percy’s fatal flaw taking over, like when he lets Ethan Nakamura live or warns the enemy demigods that Princess Andromeda will explode. I can’t lie; it was frustrating. It brings him down, makes him predictable, and weakens him. However, I still applaud how Rick wrote his character. Percy is a natural leader, commanding those with diligence and respect, with no superiority felt just because of who he is, and he isn’t thoughtless about his actions. His actions and words don’t clash, but instead, they come together for the greater good. I think he had character development in this sense, and how he learned from his mistakes. He doesn’t hold grudges for long (that’s Nico’s flaw), and he doesn’t believe he can save everyone (that’s Annabeth’s flaw), but Percy’s fatal flaw doesn’t always crash with his strength. He finds different ways to make up for what he lost, and he shows regrets for how he acted before. He acknowledges his weaknesses even if he struggles to overcome them.My annoyance with Annabeth in the previous book was strong. I wasn’t a fan of her obnoxious and rude attitude and jealousy towards Rachel, and I couldn’t get behind her concern for Luke. I will say, though, if I were someone who took back what I said, I would be saying I’m taking back what I said about Annabeth. However, I’m not that person, so I won’t be taking back my thoughts because they are still my thoughts and feelings. What I appreciated here was finally understanding why Annabeth felt the way she did in the fourth book. We learn how and why she continued being concerned over Luke and still hoped Luke was fighting Kronos in his body. We learn more critical information on Luke here, learning more about his childhood, his fate, and why he turned against the Olympians. If only Annabeth had talked to Percy in The Battle of Labyrinth about what she spoke to him here, thenmaybeI wouldn’t have grown as frustrated with her. I swear I was reading this and going, “Oh! Well, that makes sense. Too bad you didn’t tell him that before!” Annabeth’s character development was much more prominent here. She understands how her love for Luke weakens her, but she also doesn’t give up altogether. I thought it was balanced here, with her still sticking to Percy’s side more but still showing reluctance regarding Luke.The relationship between these two was lovely in this installment. I’ve enjoyed seeing how the rivalry turned to friendship and then to love. I love how the author keeps their personalities the same, where they still share a rivalry but are much more soft. Annabeth continues calling Percy ‘Seaweed Brain,’ and Annabeth is still ‘Wise Girl’ to him. Their banter is much more fun here, with different feelings and emotions growing between them. Their teenage angst is realistic and unfairly relatable. They struggle to communicate at times but make up for it in other ways. I swear their love languages are either acts of service or quality time. No matter an argument they had before, they both make it up through snarky banter one second and the next, they’re saving each other from fights. I adored seeing their progression here. Annabeth’s jealousy did not feel silly but instead adorable. I still found her attitude towards Rachel rude, and I wasn’t a fan of the sudden change at the end, which was done just because Annabeth now knew Percy didn’t like Rachel. Still, Annabeth felt more like herself: optimistic, willing, and brave.Once again, this author’s writing is stellar. His details are descriptively satisfactory, giving me an idea of what to imagine. I’ve loved the hidden messages in the writing, with remote points in quotes and statements that one can agree with. There is also enough detail on the characters, making it easy to imagine them and have them come to life. His writing continues not to feel as juvenile as expected in these books. Even if this is the fifth book and is more YA than middle-school, the writing has never felt too juvenile or childish, as if it’s written for that audience. With this being the most action-packed installment, there is not a single moment where nothing is happening. A war is brewing, Manhattan is being destroyed, and an evil army is forming. Rick’s attention to detail is splendid.Many of the side characters close to Percy were a fantastic addition—Grover being his caring self, Tyson being adorable, Mrs. O’Leary being the best fictional hellhound ever, Dionysus being hilarious as usual, Apollo being cocky, Thalia coming to the rescue, Nico being precious. I am especially excited to see Nico in the rest of the books. I enjoyed seeing the progression of him here. His fatal flaw is holding grudges, but even he has been having his character development concerning that. As for Clarisse, I’m neutral about her. I don’t hate her anymore, but she’s a little irrelevant to me as well. Also, finally meeting Will Solace, even briefly, made me excited. Knowing he and Nico end up together in the future makes me anticipate the rest of the books. And finally, I still couldn’t bring myself to hate Luke. From what we find out through Annabeth and Percy, Luke’s character had no other way. I love how Rick wrote his villain.With that being said, I can’t help but feel disappointed with the overall execution.While I love Percy’s character in terms of who he is, I still expected more ofwho he is.The final battle every previous book has led to felt incredibly underwhelming. It was one of those kinds that felt like it could’ve happened anywhere, and there was no requirement for the location of Mount Olympus. I expected more battle overall, more execution, more grit after everything everyone went through. Additionally, Percy’s character as a demigod has been baffling. Sometimes it feels like him being half-blood is irrelevant, as if it doesn’t make a difference, because thereisno difference. This book had one (1) scene where his powers came to shine, where he could show the Titans his capability. Yet, when the battle against Kronos came, there was no tension. I feel like we were robbed of what Percy can do. He’s said to be one of the strongest demigods, but we don’t see this happening. Even after five books, Percy’s powers feel trivial, as if they aren’t one of the leading and most significant points of this series. It doesn’t matter if this final installment is the most action-packed and thrilling if there isn’t any proof of it. Plus, the entire battle scene of Percy versus Kronos was simply unsatisfactory. It was one of those scenes that made me go, “That’s it? After everything!?” I was underwhelmed. Let down. Upset. Disappointed.On a final note, I still enjoyed this series overall. It has been a fun journey, and finally getting to meet these demigods and members of camp half-blood was worth it. I am excited to move on to the next series and meet the new characters, as well as reunite with older friends. I’ve already checked out the entire Heroes of Olympus series from my library, so I’m excited to get to it soon.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4556058-the-last-olympian,The Last Olympian.txt
The Titan’s Curse,"“Your fatal flaw is personal loyalty, Percy. You do not know when it is time to cut your losses. To save a friend, you would sacrifice the world. In a hero of the prophecy, that is very, very dangerous.”Imagine your biggest flaw is that you’re too loyal to your friends and would sacrifice yourself if it meant saving them.I could never be as humble as Percy.I’m still pinching myself over not having read this series before. I remember some mutuals I had here in 2016 were startingThe Hidden Oracle, and I had been set on starting the series. I don’t know what stopped me. However, I still appreciate being in my 20s and starting this now because following along the journey at this time, without worrying about books not being published yet, is relieving. Every time I’ve turned the last page of the previous books I’ve read from this series, I’m already picking up the next book. I don’t know how some of y’all read this when you were younger and kept up with all the characters and plots cause I keep needing to remind myself who is who.Still,The Titan’s Cursehad whatThe Sea of Monstersdidn’t: humor. I felt like Percy and the rest of the gang didn’t have their authentic voice in the previous book. But here, even though this story is more serious in every way, the author still manages to add sprinkles of humor and lightheartedness to show the intended audience of this story. The characters are still kids, and to me, a middle-grade novel needs to show their personalities that way. Percy is now 14, but he still has a brain developing, insecurities take over, and he makes unintentional bad decisions. Yet, we can’t help but root for him as he tries his best to save those closest to him, all while causing ruckus and havoc everywhere he goes. He’s fun, adventurous, optimistic, and a kid at heart with wit, joy, and a free spirit. I love his courageous attitude and how he’s growing into a strong young man willing to do anything to save the world. I love his determinant nature, never backing down and without a fight. I love his loving heart and how he still craves his father’s praise. I love his growing wisdom, resilience, and brave little soul. I love him and am sad about his willingness to give up for those who don’t appreciate him enough. I don’t know if this is the saddest installment of this series or what, but shoutout to Rick Riordan for making me feel sad over this 14-year-old demigod.And while the lightheartedness of the book is still relevant, the book does become more serious. Percy and his friends know the quests are becoming more serious, venturing closer to a potential and future war between the Titans and the Olympians. With the prophecy of one of the children from the three gods holding the world in their hands becoming closer and closer, the people await more clues as their futures will become reality. It becomes more difficult for them to follow along, and as they get older, their lives become more heavy. Annabeth spends most of the time out of the book because of a fight, and Percy is set on saving her. We meet many more new people, as well as continue seeing old faces, good and bad: Thalia, Zeus’s daughter, who we learned about in book 1; Luke and his growing army of bringing back Kronos; Nico and Bianca di Angelo, who we learn are Hades’ children, who he had with a mortal woman before the Oath was made; the Goddess of Hunt, Artemis, as well one of her best Hunter’s, Zoë Nightshade; the Goddess of Beauty, Aphrodite; the God of the Sun, Apollo. We have our usual God of Wine, Dionysus, who I sometimes want to slap in the face, and other times, I can’t help but sigh because of how relatable he is. There is also Rachel, who I am curious about and hope to meet again in the rest of the series. The author continues to excel in creating a fascinating but entirely fun cast of characters. Full of trust, love, betrayals, and friendship, we continue finding more secrets with the kids. It isn’t as whimsical as other books in this genre, but the stories have still provided entertainment, creating a world full of different twists that you will spot early on if you’re familiar with Greek mythology. However, the author adds his twists to it, making the read easy to follow, read, and analyze. With journey after journey, there is not a single moment of silence the characters have, yet we, as the readers, appreciate this as there is also something about to happen.With that being said, I do wish we could have had a little more backstory on Thalia’s return.The Sea of Monstersended with her introducing herself as the daughter of Zeus, yet when we open this story up, we’re suddenly thrown into her, Percy and Annabeth getting a ride from Sally Jackson, Percy’s mother, to Camp Half-Blood. There was no explanation of how Thalia’s return was taken, which made the timeline a little rusty. I would have appreciated some explanation to see how everyone took this to get a better understanding of her friendship with everyone. I also can’t lie and say that I was a big fan of her because she aggravated me a few times. My heart has been breaking for Percy since the first book, with how he was bullied by Clarrise and her goons, as well as Nancy and her minions. Then he tries his best to save one of his best friends, and along the way, he’s continuously insulted by Thalia and Zoë. To an extent, I understand where they were coming from, but other times, I wish they could have taken a chill pill. Too serious for my liking, not trustworthy enough, and hesitant. They both had a sort of leadership to them that was probably supposed to show them off as diligent and robust, but I couldn’t bring myself always to care. My heart stands with Percy, always.I am growing to love these characters more and more. With the Second Titan War approaching (it’s obvious), I can’t help but feel nothing but anticipation. Seeing these kids grow up in their way has been exciting to witness. Every scene gives a new, promising future, showing the growing potential of all the characters. I’ve also adored seeing how their feelings grow. I’m sure we’re all aware of Percy and Annabeth becoming a couple in the future, and it’s delightful to see the small things in their friendship. Not to mention, Grover has shown himself to be a trustworthy friend, someone Percy can rely on. I can’t wait to see how The Battle of the Labyrinth goes!“The most dangerous flaws are those which are good in moderation,” she said. “Evil is easy to fight. Lack of wisdom…that is very hard indeed.”",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/561456.The_Titan_s_Curse,The Titan’s Curse.txt

Sometimes the best we can do is to remind each other that we're related for better or for worse...and try to keep the maiming and killing to a minimum.”🎧 —Ship in a bottlebyFin⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻ THIS ENTIRE SERIES IS A STRAIGHT UP FIVE STARS FOR ME HONESTLY.I don't even think I could rate it any less, like it's physically impossible for my fingers to press the 4. This book was absolutely no less from the first, perfect in every way. And, of course, the Percabeth content was the peak of the book 😋.rick'swritingwas amazing as always. Easy to understand and vibrant with magic. Making it from percy's point of view was his best decision honestly, because Percy and his thoughts make everything 10x better. The morals in this series are honestly so huge and powerful for a children's book, it kills me. Rick managed to write a book with the best humor and bind in such heavy topics so delicately. The writing is one of the best parts of this book.theworld-buildingissosimple. There's literally no complicated names or new piled information, and a majority of the setting was on a boat in the sea so... The relief of not having to know and pronounce complicated and new names is unbelievable.Seeing this different side to the Greek Gods' family was a fresh change. Hermes and how he tried to get to Luke and get him to turn back 😭🫶🏼. The perspective of looking into the Olympian family is so exciting to me honestly, it's what makes me the most excited and interested in this series. It's everything. Reading this series is so exciting for me, because I'm such a greek mythology geek. Seeing all this stuff about the gods and other things is so different. If you didn't like the storyline, well, the building of the gods and the Greek mythology kept you there. It's the best aspects in the series and one that never gets old honestly.all thecharacterswere so interesting to read about. Hermes to Chiron,you wanted to know more. Everyone was written with more than just looks, they haddepthto them, youconnectedwith them. Rick Riordan has a talent for making us more curious about everything no matter who or what it is. It honestly kills me, I sympathize and am curious about so many questionable characters that it's concerning 😭.Honestly, I was kinda scared to re-read this book because Thalia comes back in this one and I'm not exactly sure how I feel about her. I don't remember much about her since I read the series before a long time ago, but I had such mixed feelings about her. I'm praying I love her in the next book 🤞🏼.Why does no one ever believe Percy throughout this series? it pisses me off 😐. Clarissa is one of my favorite characters, whether she's questionable or not. Honestly, she was jut trying to prove herself, just like Percy. Sure, she's rude but i love her 🤭.Hermes trying to get Percy to change Luke and giving him advice was everything for me this book. It honestly made me wanna cry. You get to see more of Luke's childhood throughout this book and I love Luke a lot, because I get his reasons. The gods treated their children so unfairly. Sure, they're gods, but if you're gonna sleep with a human and then just ditch her child and not claim them? like how stupid and immature honestly. The gods continued to piss me off throughout this entire series and I honestly wish I could give some of them a fucking reality check.oh my god, when annabeth swam over the edge of the ship and he swam after her.

The way he loved his friend so much that he would leave camp against orders, sneak onto a ship, jumpoffsaid ship, end up on an island, turn into aniguana pig, turn back human,steal a ship, sail in the sea, and save him from a giant sheep is literally gonna make me cry. Percy Jackson is one of the greenest book boyfriends you will ever read about. I literally adore him sm. If you can't like Percy, there's something genuinely wrong with you.

"The Hobbit, or There and Back Again","“In a city, in an English university town, there lived a don. Not a sprawling, grimy slum of a city, full of the stench of neglect and despair, nor yet a soulless prosperous city, fueled by commercial enterprise: it was an Oxford professor's hometown, and that means intellectual satisfaction.”If this rather feeble skit is instantly recognisable to you, just pause for a moment, to marvel at how much impact the original opening lines ofThe Hobbithave had. They have been incredibly successful at seeping their way into the general consciousness. In fact it could be said that this simple children's novel is responsible for triggering an entire canon of modern English Fantasy - quite an accomplishment for a quiet professor of Anglo-Saxon.Without Tolkien'sThe Hobbit, we would not have such well-formed and specific ideas of elves, dwarves, goblins, wizards, dragons and trolls. Plus, of course, his invented orcs (goblins), hobbits and wargs, and also the wonderful prehistoric era of Middle-earth (a Middle English name) which he invented for our world, would simply not exist. And even this is not the whole of it. Tolkien was responsible not only for our current ideas of many creatures of fantasy, and a whole other world. He created more than a hundred drawings to support the story. In addition he created a new ""Elvish"" language with an invented script, and also made a few changes to our own. Tolkien felt that ""dwarfs"", the plural of dwarf (a plural which had formerly been drummed into every English schoolchild of the last century) was not logical. He insisted on using an incorrect form,""dwarves"", rather than treating it as an irregular plural. His persistence succeeded. Nowadays it is common to find the plural written Tolkien's way.For the last few decades one of the highest accolades given to a new fantasy novel has been that it is Tolkien-esque. Scores of novels apparently have born comparison with the master, even more so if they are trilogies, and about a quest. Potential readers routinely used to look in the front ""to see if it had a map in it"". It could be said that this one novel kick-started, defined and inspired an entire tradition of modern fantasy. Yet it is a simple children's adventure story - isn't it?J.R.R. Tolkien was not an average children's writer. Nor was he given to writing blockbusters. On the contrary, he was a shy academic, who lived quietly with his wife and four children in North Oxford. He had an impressive record of scholarly achievements, and was a Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford University. He specialised in Old and Middle English, teaching undergraduates. The only indication of Tolkien's story-telling abilities was that he told them bedtime stories, and more unusually, he wrote illustrated letters to them ""from Santa Claus"" every Christmas. (These were later published in 1976 as""The Father Christmas Letters"", along with other early children's books he wrote specifically for his own children.)Tolkien had long been fascinated by both language and mythology. His first job had been as a lexicographer, in the course of which he helped to draft the Oxford English Dictionary. During this time he began to invent languages based on Finnish and Welsh, which he imagined might have been spoken by elves. He also began writing stories which incorporated this ""Elvish"" language, inventing a whole new mythology. He called his stories""Lost Tales"".The other part of the jigsaw comes in the form of Tolkien's social life. He became a founding member of a group of Oxford friends who had similar interests. They called themselves,""The Inklings"", a name which suggesting writing, and sounded vaguely Anglo-Saxon.""The Inklings""met for conversation and drinks, discussing religion and reading to each other from their works in progress. Tolkien was a devout Catholic, and he felt that mythology had an important role in conveying both moral and spiritual values. Incidentally, C. S. Lewis was another prominent member. He was one of Tolkien's closest friends, and an agnostic at the time. He argued against this idea, dismissing myths and fairy tales. The scene was set.By Tolkien's own account, he was routinely marking his students' exam papers, his mind possibly wandering elsewhere, and he came across a page of an answer-book which one student had left blank. In a frivolous moment, bored and feeling whimsical, he wrote,""In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.""Tolkien then became intrigued by his own daydream of an idea, deciding that he needed to find out what a hobbit was, and what sort of a hole it might live in, and so on. He began to write a story which he told to his younger children, and began to pass around his friends at""The Inklings""gatherings. It eventually found its way to a publishing house,""George Allen and Unwin"", and was pronounced as a good read by the Chairman's 10 year old son, who wrote a report about it for his father. It was then published in 1937, was immediately successful, and has been popular ever since.Not surprisingly, the publishers asked Tolkien if he had anything similar to publish. Tolkien offered them what we now know as""The Silmarillion"", but of course this was not at all similar, and the publishers' readers decided that it would not be a commercial success. The publishers therefore declined the material, but asked Tolkien if he could write a sequel. And the rest, as they say, is history, for the ""sequel"" was the magnificent trilogy,""The Lord of the Rings"". The course of the next few years - the development of a mammoth opus inspired by ancient European myths, with its own maps, mythology, languages and lore - was neither easy not straightforward. Tolkien often interrupted the writing of his story to iron out a linguistic problem or an historical inconsistency. However, eventually,""The Lord of the Rings""was published in three parts,""The Fellowship of the Ring""during 1954 and""The Two Towers""and""The Return of the King""in 1955. The story follows on fromThe Hobbit, including many of the original characters such as Gandalf the Wizard, but also inventing and introducing dozens of new ones, and a new ""hero"" hobbit, a distant younger cousin (and heir) of Bilbo's, Frodo. Its tone is also very different. Although it is said that Tolkien protested thatThe Hobbitwas not meant to be a children's book, it has the light jokey feel of one, whereas""The Lord of the Rings""is darker throughout.So what is it exactly in a simple children's story which so captured the public's imagination, leading to the phenomenon we know as""The Lord of the Rings""? FirstThe Hobbitis a story of a quest, one of the most ancient traditional stories in history. It is a story of a journey involving travel, in which the hero returns home with the object of his quest. The theme would have been a well-loved one to Tolkien, who was steeped in Old and Middle English poetry, and in Greek and Norse myth. Shortly before writingThe Hobbithe had published a scholarly essay on the Old English epic poem,""Beowulf"". In 1925 he had edited the Middle English poem""Sir Gawain and the Green Knight"", the Arthurian legend of the Holy Grail. And of course readers ofThe Hobbitwill rememberthat it is a cup which Bilbo steals from the dragon Smaug's hoard.Bilbo the hobbit's journey is through lands strange to him, and very distant from The Shire, through Mirkwood and the Misty Mountains to the Lonely Mountain. It is a perilous journey, with plenty of suspense and threat. He forms close friendships with the dwarves, and all of them suffer along the way, and risk deathin the culminating Battle of the Five Armies on the Lonely Mountain.Of course such a quest is a test of character and inner strength, and so this one proves to be. Bilbo grows both in courage and - by using his brain - in his personal integrity. We see that for much of the journey, he regrets his decision to join the dwarves, daydreaming about the comforts of his own home,“It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort”He misses his solitary pleasures, such as his traditional breakfast of bacon and eggs, and he misses his pipe full of tobacco. The dramatic adventures they are all having are not at all attractive to him. As he had said to Gandalf earlier,“We are plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures. Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner!”and,“We don't want any adventures here! You might try over the Hill or Across the Water.”In this way the quest is a metaphor for the fulfilment of both Bilbo's personal growth and his destiny. Each episode and encounter allow him different ways of responding; they serve as trials and lessons to him, in his own journey through life. As the story develops, Bilbo learns to use his intelligence, imagination, resourcefulness and courage. He increases in confidence, wisdom and power, developing personal authority. For instancehe kills the spiders, and rescues the dwarves from the dungeon of the Elvenking. Later, on his own initiative, he makes the bold and risky decision to take the Arkenstone to Bard, in an attempt to prevent a war over the treasure which the dragon Smaug is holding. The reader of any age likes to identify with the hero, an ordinary character in an extraordinary situation. Bilbo is keen to do good, for instance when he does not kill Gollum, even though he could easily use the advantage of his invisibility, and his sword, to help him.And it has to be said that the Bilbo of the novels is very childlike, in the way he is viewed, both by the other characters and by the reader. We have an impression of a short, small, young (for a hobbit) only partly developed character. One whose behaviour has many similarities with a child's. At any rate, a child would have no difficulty about empathising with Bilbo, yet at the same time appreciating that he is a funny sort of old-fashioned, eccentric and pompous personage,“Already he was a very different hobbit from the one that had run out without a pocket-handkerchief from Bag-End long ago. He had not had a pocket-handkerchief for ages.”Bilbo has a strong sense of right and wrong. He is indignant that the dwarves have had their gold stolen, and saddened that the town of Dale is in ruins. The novel describes many stretches of bleak landscape on the way to the Lonely Mountain; desolate places where nothing can grow. Part of Bilbo's quest is to somehow put this right.His enemies are Smaug and to a lesser extent Gollum, although he sees that Gollum is also to be pitied. Both of them would rather kill than share what they are in possession of. There are echoes throughoutThe Hobbitof this disapproval of acquisitiveness; a clear message that overconcern for material wealth is corrupting. The Master of Lake-town will not use his wealth to rebuild the town devastated by Smaug, so eventually he loses power to be replaced by the fairer man, Bard, who earlier had killed Smaug. The dwarves seem at their weakest and least clear-thinking when they are greedy for gold. Even Thorin's death could be understood in a sense to be a consequence of him being the most prone to the""dragon-sickness""or in other words, the lust for gold, in starting off the revenge journey in the first place.By the end of the novel Bilbo has changed, because of what he has experienced and whom he has encountered. As we expect from a children's tale, though, it has not been a truly life-changing experience for him. He has merely discovered a new and individual side to his character, in that he is more like his adventurous Took relatives on his mother's side, than the rather staid Baggins side whom he resembled at the start of the novel,“The Bagginses had lived in the neighbourhood of The Hill for time out of mind, and people considered them very respectable, not only because most of them were rich, but also because they never had any adventures or did anything unexpected: you could tell what a Baggins would say on any question without the bother of asking him.”The reader can see that a humorous attitude such as this, from near the beginning of the novel,“The washing-up was so dismally real that Bilbo was forced to believe the party of the night before had not been part of his bad dreams, as he had rather hoped”could equally well be held by the Bilbo of the end of the novel.The Hobbitis an extraordinary creation. Tolkien combined the ancient heroic Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian epics he knew so well, with the middle-class rural England in which he lived. He himself admitted that Bilbo Baggins was based on the rural Englishmen of his own time. To transpose a rural Englishman of the 1930's into an heroic setting, describing the ensuing adventures with gentle comedy and whimsical charm, made for an immediate success. The way it is told is, strangely, even now not particularly dated. Tolkien gives us a lot of information about the lifestyle of hobbits, the ancient history of dwarves and elves, and even about runes. It is clear that the narrator knows everything, knows what will happen in the future of the story. The narrator frequently hints at - or even refers to - other episodes in the story, and what will happen to the characters. But all this information is imparted in an entertaining rather than a boring instructive way. The novel’s playful jocular tone and imagery continues to appeal both to children and adults. Tolkien uses a chatty voice throughout inThe Hobbit, sounding as if he is sitting next to you telling you the story personally. For instance when he states Bilbo's greeting,“I am just about to take tea; pray come and have some with me”he then goes on to comment on it chattily,“A little stiff perhaps, but he meant it kindly. And what would you do, if an uninvited dwarf came and hung his things up in your hall without a word of explanation?”Later on in identifying the wood-elves, he comments that“of course”that is what they are. He talks directly to the reader, using the word“you”in the manner of much earlier novelists. He also treads a very fine line between what might be regarded as “twee” or cosy, and what comes across as merely comic and amusing. The dwarves are clearly figures of fun,“there was a very old-looking dwarf on the step with a white beard and a scarlet hood; and he too hopped inside as soon as the door was open, just as if he had been invited. “I see they have begun to arrive already,” he said when he caught sight of Dwalin’s green hood hanging up. He hung his red one next to it, and “Balin at your service!” he said with his hand on his breast.”Yet oddly the reader can believe totally in their strength, loyalty and courage. Not only do elves, dwarves, goblins and trolls differ from one another in their physical and psychological attributes, but Tolkien represents all these different types of fantasy characters as each having an inherent morality. For instance, all the elves are good, and all the goblins are bad. The good fantasy creatures are portrayed as being in harmony with nature, while the evil ones are depicted as being at odds with it. So the eagles decide to side with the elves, who are on the side of nature, and help them to defeat the evil goblins or orcs.Tolkien reveals many of his own personal attitudes and opinions inThe Hobbit, and one example is clearly indicatedin Thorin's final words. One might expect an heroic or pompous statement, as Thorin throughout has been depicted as one who has a rather pompous and self-important streak in him.Yet his final words to Bilbo are not heroic or grand. They are wise, but not epic. They are not ancient, but modern. They echo the simplicity of the hobbits' own values,“If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.”J.R.R. Tolkien has never been fully accepted by the English Literary establishment, some of whom have condemned both his books and all the following influenced fiction. But Tolkien remains loved by millions of readers worldwide. His books are global best sellers, and adaptations abound. Fans form Tolkien clubs, learning his fictional languages, and indulging in all thing Tolkienian.Perhaps it is necessary, as a final word, to say a little about the recent famous adaptation ofThe Hobbitinto a trio of films by the director Peter Jackson. They too are astounding achievements, clearly a loving tribute by a talented admirer of Tolkien's works. Many people may now come to the novel after seeing these films. Out all the adaptations I know, they stand alone. I went to see the first part, for instance, five times in the cinema, despite not usually watching any film there more than once. But ...All three films are really only loosely based onThe Hobbit. Much of the dialogue is there, but also there are many discrepancies. Jackson's humour is not Tolkien's. His vision of the characters - especially the comic dwarves - differs. He takes liberties with the plot, changing both histories and current events. He adds characters. He amplifies both from other parts of Tolkien's works and also from his own imagination. My personal opinion is that the films are excellent, but different. And if you have such a respect for Tolkien's vision that you cannot bear for it to be altered in any way, then you may not enjoy them.The original novel however, is in a class of its own. It is unique and groundbreaking. And still remains a lot of fun to read.In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.“I suppose hobbits need some description nowadays, since they have become rare and shy of the Big People, as they call us. They are (or were) a little people, about half our height, and smaller than the bearded dwarves. Hobbit have no beards. There is little or no magic about them, except the ordinary everyday sort which helps them to disappear quickly when large stupid folk like you and me come blundering along, making a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile off. They are inclined to be fat in the stomach; they dress in bright colours (chiefly green and yellow) wear no shoes because their feet grow natural leathery soles and thick warm brown hair like the stuff on their heads (which is curly); have long clever brown fingers, good-natured faces, and laugh deep fruity laughs (especially after dinner, which they have twice a day when they can get it.)”",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5907.The_Hobbit_or_There_and_Back_Again,"The Hobbit, or There and Back Again.txt"
Kingdom of the Wicked,"☆ 3 / 5 ☆Kingdom of the Cursed(Book 2) : 3 / 5Kingdom of the Feared(Book 3) : 2 / 5“There are victors and victims. Decide who you want to be. Or the choice will be made for you, witch. And I doubt you’ll like it.”In all honesty this book doesn’t have much going for it but it was still a lot of fun to get through. Was it riddled with inconsistencies and plot convenience? Most definitely, but it was also a true page-turner and very easily consumable.I also enjoyed the author’s first book in the Stalking Jack the Ripper series and I think it’s because Kerri Maniscalco’s writing has a certain quality to it that makes it easy to be immersed in a story and want to keep reading it despite its flaws.Kingdom of the Wicked is set in 19th century Palermo where Emilia, a witch, and her family lives and runs a pretty popular restaurant. They live a pretty normal life while hiding their powers from humans until she discovers the horribly mutilated body of her twin sister, Vittoria. Emilia only finds vengeance in her heart and is ready to do anything to find her sister’s murderer. She ends up allying herself with Wrath, one of the Princes of Hell, despite her grandmother’s warnings and discovers that there might be more to her twin’s death than she initially thought.Emilia ends up being pretty reckless in her decisions and honestly I don’t think she stopped to think for a second about anything. In and of itself this could’ve been fine but the author is trying to portray her character as smart and competent and she is never actually shown being either of those things. The one aspect that actually made me like her a little more was her relationship with her sister. You can tell they were really close and loved each other a whole lot. Emilia’s determination to solve her murder and put anything else aside is very believable and scenes of her processing her grief a little more outwardly definitely made me feel for her. Aside from that I just didn’t really care for her as a character, I found nothing appealing or anything that really stood out to me as more than a one dimensional character placeholder.“You might hate it. Or love it. But temptation will surge through those magical veins of yours, obliterating all common sense. You’ll want me to save you from the endless torment by giving you everything you love to loathe. And when I do, you’ll thirst for more.”And this is also why I wasn’t invested in the romance of this book. I just can’t see why Wrath would take a romantic interest in her and there was truly no chemistry between the two of them. I actually enjoyed Wrath’s character and found him intriguing but a lot of his motivations concerning Emilia and the things he did for her just didn’t really make sense to me. The dialogue between the two of them felt really forced while it was aiming for “we despise each other” banter. I feel like if the romance had been more believable to me I would’ve looked past a lot of other things and this book could’ve been an easy 3 star read.I really enjoyed the setting for the most part especially when it came to the family’s restaurant and all the food descriptions made me feel more immersed, and hungry! This is supposed to be 19th century Italy but it’s all written pretty loosely when it comes to placing the story in a historical context and some elements felt more earlier 20th century to me. It didn’t bother me too much but this feels definitely more like a generic setting rather than an accurate one. I also really enjoyed the city being so lively at night and the descriptions of that, and the recurring trips to the monastery.And now, for the plot itself. It was very predictable, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but it was all just very convenient. A lot of information was withheld by characters with no solid motivation to do so, or in accordance with their personalities, but just for the sake of creating mystery in the book. This mostly came up with the grandmother and it just made me dislike her as a character and every scene with her was very frustrating.There were also a lot of inconsistencies with what Emilia thought was going on and coming back on things she’d said before or being repetitive processing information that had already been put into the book previously. It felt messy and it led a lot of her reasoning to not make sense at all.“The devil demanded retribution. A blood sacrifice for power stolen.”A lot of things concerning the magic in this book were also pretty inconsistent and unclear. There were a lot of things she could just do just because it was what was needed in the moment for the scene to move forward, the rules applying to demons seemed to shift whenever it fit the narrative best, and overall I don’t think the magic system was well established. I did however enjoy the powers of the Princes of Hell and how their influence worked on people. I would’ve liked to delve into those ways more than this book did because at the end of the day these demons who are supposed to be very powerful didn’t feel all that threatening.Their powers felt very diminished when compared to minor demons being able to bypass the rules they were subjected to and witches truly having more power than they do. Emilia would very easily “trick” these demons (probably to show how smart of a character she is but it only undermined how powerful these demons supposedly were) or do things that they couldn’t. A teenage witch who is honestly lacking in her skills could easily cast a sleeping spell but a Prince of Hell.. couldn’t? It just felt very nonsensical to me and lessened the threat of any possible confrontation.I would also like to note that a scene pushed forward with Lust’s power where Emilia expressed her discomfort with the feeling of hands grabbing her was handled very dubiously.“In the end, the monster we feared didn’t come from Hell. He came from privilege.”The writing itself is pretty easy to read and makes it so the reading experience itself was enjoyable. I do feel though like there were some passages or quotes that sounded good on paper but did not make sense in context. There’s not much point in saying that demonic forces aren’t at work and privilege is the source of evil when this story fully revolves around demons, their world and their schemes, and there is absolutely no commentary whatsoever about any sort of privilege in this whole book. It would’ve been interesting to overlap that with the work of these literal personifications of sin but it’s not really the case here. There were allusions to witch hunts and the killing of innocent women because of that, but it never actually delved into what persecution and oppression truly means. The main character is never shown as being stifled in any sort of way and these remarks just feel off and like a half-hearted attempt at white feminism 101.The ending of the book was pretty much what I had expected it to be so I didn’t feel either let down or shocked, and I think it gives a definite opening for the sequel. Overall I was far from miserable reading this book but there were truly so many things piling up and taking away from a story that had potential.Youtube☆TwitterBuddy read withMelanie♡",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52735921-kingdom-of-the-wicked,Kingdom of the Wicked.txt
Where the Wild Things Are,"Through a Child’s Eye(A Book Review of Maurice Sendak’sWhere The Wild Things Are)I’m glad that I recently scored a vintage 1963 edition (pictures here) of Maurice Sendak’sWhere the Wild ThingsAre in Booksale during one of the mini Meet Ups with my Goodreads-The Filipino Group friends. I breeze through the book in a matter of minutes while waiting for them, and right there and then something just hit me. Without a doubt, it certainly earns its place as a classic storybook of Children’s Literature.Where the Wild Things Aretells the story of the rascal Max, who dresses up in his wolf suit and causes trouble enough to make his mother order him to go to bed without supper at all. As the title alludes, the picture book shows a child’s unbound and limitless wild rumpus of an imagination exhibited when Max reaches deeper within his imagining and sees his room transformed into a forest inhabited by the Wild Things — roaring and gnashing monsters with yellow eyes, sharp teeth and horns — where he, by a mere stare, can tame and be the king of them all.I think what endears every child who reads Sendak’s picture book is that most of them can identify with Max’s feeling of resentment, that though he had had his share of fun out of it, he eventually grows weary and lonely, permitting him later on to go back to the place where he most wants to be and appreciate the most important thing he left behind: the need to feel loved.At home, after a tiring yet fun-filled day with friends and before hitting the sack, I’m still at it, staring mesmerized by Sendak’s impressive work of art with its muted colors and cross-hatchings, that looks like sketches, add further magic, energy and excitement to every kid who reads it they would love to be in the shoes of Max, playing with the Wild Things on their “wild rumpus” where they can howl at the moon and swing from tree to tree in bold celebration of all the wildness they possess.I rue the fact that I stumbled upon this picture book well into my manhood, but it definitely touched something in me — the book has this uncanny ability to enchant itself to the nostalgic memory of childhood, rekindling its innermost emotions. It’s as if I’m seeing the world again through a child’s eye.Nevertheless, this is a book worth keeping — for every reading always brings a new perspective, a nuanced view of the book’s message — which I will one day read to my future children and let them discover for themselves a world of their own creation; a world where the wild things are, where only they has the power to tame._________________________Book Details: Book#24for 2011Published by Harper & Row, Publishers(Hardcover, 1963 First Edition)42 pagesRead on: June 15, 2011My Rating: ★★★★★[See this review on my book blogDark Chest of Wondersand for many others.]",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19543.Where_the_Wild_Things_Are,Where the Wild Things Are.txt
The Day the Crayons Quit,"It is possible to read too much into a picture book. A funny statement since what were talking about is literature for people who haven't even seen a decade of time pass them by. But historically picture books have been places where prejudices are both intentionally and unintentionally on display. Yet for everyDenverby David McKee (a picture book about the beauty of trickle down economics) you'll find fifty people reading WAY too much into something likeRainbow Fish(Communist propaganda) orClick Clack Moo(inculcating kids into unionism). The thing is, picture books are meant to teach and inform our children. Yet along the way a parent or gatekeeper might be worried about the unintentional messages getting pushed along the way. At the end of the day you have to weigh your reactions carefully. You can't be pointing fingers left and right, claiming authorial intent where there is none. Okay. So round about now you're trying to figure out what the heck any of this has to do withThe Day the Crayons Quitby Drew Daywalt. I mean, talk about an innocuous title. Why am I going on and on about unintentional messages in works of children's fiction in preface to talking about this book? Well, here's the trouble. I have a major problem with this story and it's entirely possible that it's just in my own head. So here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to lay out the facts as they stand and you can judge for yourself whether or not this book does indeed make a major you-can't-do-that-in-the-21st-century mistake, or if I'm simply suffering from a case of Reading Too Much Into It. Either way, it sure makes this Daywalt/Jeffers collaboration into an interesting point of discussion.Duncan's your average kid. Not the kind of person who's going to expect that when he reaches for his crayons at school he is, instead, going to find himself with a bundle of letters. Each letter is from a different crayon voicing their complaints. Says gray, ""I know that elephants are gray but that's a lot of space to color in all by myself."" Or pink saying, ""Could you please use me sometime to color the occasional pink dinosaur or monster or cowboy?"" Red and blue need a rest, white feels empty, yellow and orange both claim the sun, and all black ever wanted in life was, for once, to color in a rainbow or a beach ball. By the end of the letters Duncan wants to make the crayons happy. And that's when he comes up with the perfect solution to everybody's woes.Now let's talk crayon history for a bit. This is fun. In 1962 the U.S. Civil Rights Movement was underway. America was going through big changes. Assumptions that had lain dormant for years were finally getting challenged and even crayons were getting a double glance. You see 1962 was the year that Crayola decided to officially change the crayon known as ""flesh"" to ""peach"". You see where I am going with this, I suspect. While white children certainly would use the color as flesh, it wasn't exactly on the up and up to assume that white was the de facto skin color. Fast forward to 2013 and the publication ofThe Day the Crayons Quit. Peach does indeed make an appearance in this book and in that section complains vociferously that its wrapper has been removed. ""Now I'm NAKED and too embarrassed to leave the crayon box. I don't even have any underwear!"" That Daywalt is linking peach to flesh again is no crime. Interestingly, on the previous page the pink crayon has been making a very different complaint about never being allowed to draw cowboys or dinos or monsters. The monster that it HAS drawn is covering its private parts, obviously believing itself to be naked as well, as the dinosaur points and laughs. So. Pink and peach are clearly equated with flesh tones.Then what's the deal with brown?There is only one vaguely brownish crayon in this book and it is the much maligned beige. The official brown does not make an appearance it would seem. Beige's sadness is the fact that while ""Brown gets all the bears, ponies and puppies . . . the only things I get are turkey dinners (if I'm lucky) and wheat.""Mmm hmm.This is precisely where the difficulty comes into play. How much am I reading into this through my own prejudices? Let me give you a bit of comparison. This year is also seeing the publication ofThe Black Rabbitby Philippa Leathers. In that particular book a little white rabbit keeps seeing a ""scary"" big black rabbit that he runs away from. The black rabbit is, in fact, the little rabbit's own shadow and at the end he comes to love the big black rabbit after all. A librarian recently commented to me that it would have been far preferable if the little rabbit had been brown or some other color. Otherwise you have a book where a white character fears a big black one. At first I was inclined to agree, but after thinking about it I wasn't so sure. After all, the white rabbit's fears are entirely in its own head. There's also the fact that the book, I believe, is originally Australian, so the author wasn't working with a lot of the codes and keys common in American culture. I was even reminded of the huge brouhaha surroundingThe Rabbits' Weddingby Garth Williams. In 1958 the Alabama state library system removed the book from circulation because it featured a black rabbit and a white rabbit getting married. But sometimes a rabbit is just a rabbit.So is a crayon just a crayon? I think the difference may lie in what a kid gets out of reading this book. In the case ofThe Black Rabbit, few kids are going to equate themselves with fluffy bunnies. Even if they do, the black rabbit is ultimately the hero of the story. There's a bit of a difference with crayons. Kids are constantly coloring themselves and the people they love with the crayons they have on hand. Crayola, knowing this, even released a brand of multicultural crayons of varying brown tones in response to the public's desire for that very product. So to produce a book where pink and flesh are equated with skin tones and that possibility isn't even considered with beige or brown makes for a complicated reading. It's an easy mistake to make if you're not thinking about it at first, but you would have thought that someone in the course of editing this thing might have brought the point up with Mr. Daywalt. Heck, they might have brought it up with Jeffers too, since he's the one who came up with the naked monster picture in the first place.Getting away from brown, beige, and peach crayons entirely, let's look at the book in terms of its other merits. When I was a kid I definitely ascribed personalities to inanimate objects. Not just dolls and toys, oh no. I could turn a game of War into a long drawn out romantic epic, thanks to the personalities ascribed to various playing cards. And crayons were no exception. Each one had a different part to play. They dealt with jealousies and romances, the whole nine yards. So in that frame of mind,The Day the Crayons Quitspeaks to something very real. Kids like to believe that the objects that they play with are as invested in the experience as the kids themselves. So Daywalt has clearly found a unique but necessary niche. If he follows the book up with a story of playing cards we'll know he's on the right track.This is also an epistolary picture book. I don't know if Daywalt knows this, but a common assignment given by a variety of different elementary school teachers requires kids to read epistolary books (Dear Mrs. LaRue,The Journey of Oliver K. Woodman, etc.). As such,The Day the Crayons Quitis no doubt destined to remain on multiple children's book lists for decades and decades to come.Which is a bit of a pity since the book itself is tailor made for an adult readership. Sure, some kids are going to get a real kick out of it. But as I read through the book I kept thinking that were it not for the art of Oliver Jeffers, this title would be a difficult read. After all, it's pretty much all about the words. Jeffers does what he can to give as much life and vitality as he can to the text, but there are twelve letters in here and around the orange and yellow crayons you'll be forgiven if your attention starts to wane.That's why the success of the book (and success it indeed is) can be ascribed primarily to its illustrator. I began to notice that the childlike style of the art can really, believably be the style of a kid. This is undoubtedly why Jeffers was picked for the project in the first place. Aside from David Shannon it can be difficult to find artists that replicate children's art styles without coming off as half-cooked. Jeffers has also taken great pains to put in as many small clever details as possible, and it makes for a very rewarding rereading. At first you wouldn't notice. His Santa on a fire truck is straightforward. The dragon accidentally burning a clump of grapes is cute but for me the book really picks up with (no surprise here) the moment when Jeffers gets to draw a penguin. Even the paper he chooses for each crayon is interesting and significant. Admittedly I was a little surprised that the purple crayon's letter wasn't written on lined paper (since it's such a stickler for staying inside the lines) while the gray crayon's was. His faux coloring books are fun in and of themselves but it's the final picture that's worth it. There are a lot of hat tips to the crayons' demands to be found here, from black rainbows to white cats. I think the character of Duncan still totally forgot to pay heed to blue's request, but otherwise it's on the up and up. You could even ignore that all the humans are drawn with pink or peach or white crayons, if you had half a mind to.That's sort of what makes the problems I have with the book such a bummer. There's really good stuff going on here! Oliver Jeffers is fun to watch no matter what he does and Daywalt has the makings of a fine author for kids. The troubles come when you look at what the book is saying. Fans of a certain stripe are sure to disregard my concerns with a wave of their hand. ""She's reading WAY too much into this"", they might say. Probably. But it seems to me that you cannot write a book about crayons and mention peach and pink as naked without acknowledging that not every kid in the world thinks of those colors as a flesh tones. I mean, that's just obvious. Here's beige again: ""I am BEIGE and I am proud."" Beige power, eh? Come on, little crayon. Time for you to think outside the box.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16101018-the-day-the-crayons-quit,The Day the Crayons Quit.txt

Dragons Love Tacos,"""Magnificent!! Hilarious!! Also... Informative! ; ) ""^^^ The comments above were insisted upon by my son, when I read this to him at the library a few days ago. Granted, he is 16... but he was having a rough day, and on a whim, we decided to read children's books together, sitting in the rocking chairs, in the children's section of the library. This was the result.The humor in this picture book is pure stress relief, for us, at least. This is the tale of a boy who adores dragons, and of the dragons themselves, who adore tacos. This boy really wants to have a taco party, in order to have dragon houseguests, and so begins the fun.There's a great deal of tongue-in-cheek humor, as the author gives us quasi-serious 'information' about why dragons love tacos so much, and how to host a taco party for them. The writing is simple and whimsical, a bit repetitive - but repetition in this case is a technique that will keep younger listeners (pre-readers) hooked. There's a very basic problem/solution plot-line, easily comprehended by kiddos.The illustrations are what originally caught my eye: my artist child says they were most likely done with watercolors, and the result is a combination of fun, funny, and attractive. The dragons are hilarious: many different shapes and colors, quirky facial expressions and poses, different personalities indicated by their actions. The larger portion of the story is told through the illustrations, so be sure to take time to savor them. We especially liked the banana-shaped dragons in flight!Recommended for children ages 4 to 10, and for the adults who love to read to them, or with them.ALSO recommended for grumpy teenagers who secretly wish that they were still young enough to fit on Mommy's lap, in the rocking chair...",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13337050-dragons-love-tacos,Dragons Love Tacos.txt
It's a Book,"Where to begin? Begin at the beguine, I suppose. I’ve hadIt’s a Booksitting on my shelf for months and now the time is ripe. As you may have heard one place or another, it contains an off-color word at the end (“jackass”, belated spoiler alert) and it makes fun of folks who prefer online zips and whizbangs to good old-fashioned paper books. So what are we to make of it? Well, I hate to lob this designation on any author or illustrator I like, but this is so clearly a picture book for grown-ups that it squeaks. While kids today slip from electronic readers to paper books and back again like svelte otters, it is the grown-ups around them that are heard cooing and purring every time a shiny new electronic toy hits the market. For those who love the printed page, such enthusiasm can be scary. Kids don’t fear for the so-called “death of the book” but some of their caregivers certainly do, and so for them Lane Smith has penned an exchange between a pixel-happy donkey and the monkey (slash ape) who just wants to read his book in peace.Hedging his bets right from the start, Smith begins by pulling his punch as far back as it can reasonably go. Turn to the title page and you read, “It’s a mouse. It’s a jackass. It’s a monkey.” Ignoring the fact that the monkey is actually an ape (though he may be hiding his tail beneath his, uh, muumuu?), the story begins with the donkey asking the primate what he’s got there. “It’s a book.” Not understanding the donkey tries to figure out the use of such an object. “Can it text?” “No.” “Tweet?” “No.” “Wi-Fi?” “No.” Eventually the donkey gets to see what a book really can do and when his companion asks if he can have his book back he gets a pretty straightforward, “No,” echoing his own earlier dismissals. The donkey, to his credit, offers to charge the book up when he’s done, but the mouse perched on the top of the monkey’s (slash ape’s) head clarifies everything, “You don’t have to . . .” Turn the page. “It’s a book, jackass.”In the past, Smith was king at walking the fine line between adult humor and children’s humor. Books likeThe Happy Hockey Familyremain spot on. Kids find them funny just on a basic humor level and adults love the sly jabs at easy reading books of yore. This balance was once a Smith trademark, but lately he’s been falling too far on the adult side of the equation. When I mentionThe Big Elephant in the Roomto other children’s librarians I often meet with blank stares. Though it came out just a year beforeIt’s a Book, this title was a pretty strange concoction. In it a donkey (a jackass?) asks another about “the elephant in the room”. His companion then launches into a series of unspoken topics that might be that elephant until, at the end, we see an actual elephant sitting in the room. After trying to figure out if there was a political point to the story (donkeys and elephants rarely co-mingle for any other reason) it occurred to me that the book made no sense. Ofcoursethe first thing a child reader is going to assume when they hear the term “elephant in the room” is that there’s an actual elephant there. Only adults would go along with the donkey’s string of interpersonal mishaps. IfThe Big Elephant in the Roommissed its mark,It’s a Bookmissed the same mark, but managed to hit a much larger target: an adult readership.It’s telling that reviews on sites like Amazon display less a sense of moral outrage against the use of the “jackass” but rather a quiet bewilderment about the book’s audience. The outraged folks are there, of course, but folks that simply want to know “why” outnumber them. Or maybe a more accurate word would be “who?” Who precisely is this a book for? The answer comes, horrifyingly enough, from Barnes and Noble. The bookstore behemoth has for years been able to command that authors and illustrators change aspects of their books (words, cover images, etc.) or else pay the ultimate price: No display space. Rumor has it (and I’m working purely off of what I’ve heard) that so incensed was B&N by Smith’s use of the term “jackass” that they insisted he change the word. Smith adamantly stood by his ""jackass"" and so when you walk into your local B&N (as of the writing of this review) you will findIt’s a Booknot in the children’s section at all, but in the adult humor section. The thing is, B&N inadvertently got it right. Not about the word, mind you, but about what exactly the real audience for this title is.Now before I go any farther, I have indeed heard teachers of older children (4th & 5th graders, for example) say that kids get a kick out of this book. And while I am pleased the older children are okay with being read picture books, were they the perceived audience from the start of the book’s creation? Probably not. No 4th or 5th grader I know is going to confuse a book with a Kindle or nook. Smith’s sort of setting up a straw man here, but it’s not for the kids. It’s for the adults. The ones who worry somewhere in the back of their minds that books will someday be nothing more than pixels on a screen. The ones who see their children playing online, texting their friends, updating their Facebook statuses, and fear for the future of the printed page. For themIt’s a Bookis a rallying cry. It touches on everything they fear and then tells them exactly what they want to hear: That the people who live solely in the world of bits and bytes are truly jackasses at heart.And what about that word anyway? Like pretty much every other reader I was surprised the first time I got to the end of the book. I’m not going to raise a fuss about the term per say. After all, Tinkerbell calls Peter “you silly ass” inPeter Panwhile even the belovedJames and the Giant Peach(which Smith once illustrated himself) knew when to brandish the term. But then, these books were chapter books. Would I, then, keep this book off my picture book shelves? Of course not! In a culture where we’ve movies named things likeKick-Assin the theaters, the term is practically ubiquitous. My objection isn’t that he uses the word, but that he uses it poorly. Look, I’m a children’s librarian. Let’s say I read this book to a room full of second graders. We’re all having a good time, I’m doing cool sound effects, and then we get to the end. The mouse says, “It’s a book, jackass” and suddenly the entire tone of the storytime has changed. What was a fun informative book suddenly turns . . . well . . . nasty. Because what exactly is the mouse saying? That if you are ignorant of something, like books, and try to learn more then you’re a jackass? That anyone who comes to books late in life is a jackass? What exactly is the donkey’s crime here? What, for that matter, is the point of the final sentence?The point is to shock and ultimately amuse adult readers, and in this Smith has succeeded beyond measure. It’s the final ZING for an audience that’s comfortable with the term but didn’t expect to see it in a children’s book. They gasp, then laugh at the fact that they laughed, then feel great affection for the story because (as I mentioned before) it taps into their own fears and reassures them. The only people left out of the equation are children, but that doesn’t matter. Small fry don’t earn money with which to buy too many books anyway. This begs the question about whether or not the fact that the intended audience is grown-up is even a problem. I don’t suppose so but I don’t like it when books masquerade as something they are not. If this is a book for big people then say it loud and clear. And if it is for little people, why did you make it so mature?The kicker is that Smith’s art is superb here. Really quite lovely. Where inThe Big Elephant in the Roomhe seemed to be sleepwalking through the pages, here his lines are crisp and clean and almost geometric. Look how beautifully the donkey’s ears curve from his head to their tips and back again. Check out the beauty of the straight-backed red chair he sits in. This is almost a Mondrian painting subdued into a natural palette and then transformed into a book for kids. I daresay Smith hasn’t done art this lovely in years. And look at his fonts! The donkey’s are that strange computerized font we just naturally associate with computers. The mouse and monkey (slash ape) speak with fonts that are far more . . . literary, shall we say? There was thought, clear thought, behind these choices.I can’t help but be amused by the irony that a book that proclaims loud and long the great delights of the printed word verses the electronic one happens to have its own online book trailer (one that judiciously makes sure not to mention the naughty word at the end, by the way). In essence, the book has done precisely what it meant to. It has amused adults to no end. And while it will probably never be read to a class of first or second graders in a true storytime, it will live on in the bookshelves of college students across the country. While it does, I’ll hope for the return of Lane Smith to the world of children’s literature written for kids first and foremost. Writing for adults is all well and good, but anyone can do that. It takes a special knack to write a book that a kid really loves and enjoys. Fingers crossed that it happens for Mr. Smith again sometime real soon.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7747422-it-s-a-book,It's a Book.txt
The Adventures of Beekle: The Unimaginary Friend,"Now I realise that Dan Santat'sThe Adventures of Beekle: The Unimaginary Friendwon the Caldecott Medal, and that judging from the for the most part very positive reviews, many readers do seem to really really love the illustrations (that they are considered expressive, imaginative and even rather magical). However and all that having been said, I for one have not at ALL enjoyed either the illustrations (their Caldecott Medal designation notwithstanding) or the accompanying text, the presented narrative ofThe Adventures of Beekle: The Unimaginary Friend. Sorry, but for my own aesthetics, Dan Santat's illustrations, while indeed bright and imaginative, are simply not even remotely visually pleasing to and for my eyes, with especially the main character, with especially Beekle, reminding me rather painfully of a marshmallow like Pokemon type of creature (and why he has to be wearing that crown on his head, I will never really understand). And furthermore, as someone who has always had issues with contrast, the fact that Beekle is almost entirely white in colour has made him rather massively difficult to even adequately see and detect at times (for especially in those scenes ofThe Adventures of Beekle: The Unimaginary Friendwhere the surroundings are washed-out, are whitish or of a pale yellow type of hue, Beekle often simply seems to just blend into the environment, necessitating squinting on my part, even if I am wearing glasses, and causing an annoying bit of eye strain for me).And as to the actual story, as to Dan Santat's accompanying text (for he functions as both author and illustrator here), while the concept ofThe Adventures of Beekle: The Unimaginary Friend, while the general idea of an imaginary friend type going travelling, going out to find a child to be its companion is indeed novel and an interesting twist (and while I have to a point actually enjoyed the ending ofThe Adventures of Beekle: The Unimaginary Friend, with Alice arriving and noticing Beekle, and both of them slowly becoming friends and companions), I cannot say that I have found either the general set-up or the specifics of how Dan Santat moves the plot along all that engrossing or in any way engaging. For while story presented inThe Adventures of Beekle: The Unimaginary Friendis sweet enough, I guess, for me personally, there certainly has in no manner been any kind of a ""wow"" or a ""yes"" factor, just a bit of a tedious yawn and even, and sadly, also a personal happiness thatThe Adventures of Beekle: The Unimaginary Friendwas short and only took about five minutes maximum to read (because the illustrations simply are not my cup of proverbial tea by any stretch of the imagination, and the accompanying printed words, the narrative, the storyline of Beekle looking for a friend and finally finding Alice, while indeed tender and loving, are for all intents and purposes really not special enough to mask or to overcome my aesthetic annoyances and frustrations with the pictorial images, with how Beekle in particular has been depicted).",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18295821-the-adventures-of-beekle,The Adventures of Beekle The Unimaginary Friend.txt

This is also a book that can be used as a strategy of showing students how things are put together (even themselves). Students can work on a puzzle and verbalize the strategy used to put the puzzle together. This can work to show students that we can begin the story in different parts or event that it is okay to be different.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/474858.A_Bad_Case_of_Stripes,A Bad Case of Stripes.txt

Harold and the Purple Crayon,"Crockett Johnson's allegorical retelling of Books 1-6 of Vergil'sAeneidis still as powerful today as when it was originally published in 1955. After being startled by a ""dragon"" guarding apples - a reference to the Achaian menace brought on by the Golden Apple of Discord - Harold/Aeneas is forced into an involuntary sea voyage, accompanied only by the moon (here a stand-in for his patroness/mother Venus). He lands in a pleasant country, and enjoys a seaside feast (the wealth and luxury of Carthage), accompanied by a ""hungry moose"" and a ""deserving porcupine"", allegories for Dido and her sister Anna. It is no accident that it is Anna who is the ""deserving"" one - Dido, who spurns Iarbas in favor of trying to divert Aeneas from his divine mission is satirized as thin and rapacious.Abandoning these at their banquet of overabundance, Harold/Aeneas continues his journey. He tries to climb a mountain to help locate his objective (the land where he is destined to settle), but it is only after a plunge into an abyss that he can gain enlightenment. Here Johnson has replaced the Roman conception of the underworld with a more strikingly literal representation - there ""wasn't any other side"" of the mountain, merely a void. Finally sensing that he is near to his destination, he passes first by a false house and then an entire false city - obvious metaphors for the false destinations such as Sicily which tempt the Trojan settlers. Harold/Aeneas ""asks a policeman"" (King Latinus) for directions, but, as Aeneas is guided by divine destiny, Latinus merely directs him ""the way he was going anyway"". Vergil's theme that a divine origin - and the firm religious foundation built upon this - is the wellspring of Roman glory is well symbolized by the ending; the journey of Harold/Aeneas ends when he embraces ""pietas"" and the destiny placed upon him by Venus, and builds his ""room"" around her (thus establishing the Roman race).Crockett Johnson's masterful interpretation of this theme through spartan monochrome illustrations offers a remarkable counterpoint to Vergil's ornate Latin verse. But the pinnacle of his creation lies in the titular instrument. It is no great exaggeration to say that Vergil's patron, Augustus, was at the time engaged in remaking Rome in his own image. The author's metaphor is dual - Harold is not merely Aeneas, founder of the Romans. He is Augustus, the fulfillment of the Aeneid's central prophecies, redrawing Rome with an imperial purple crayon.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/98573.Harold_and_the_Purple_Crayon,Harold and the Purple Crayon.txt

Even those could be just electronic too, and the Books be just like Good Ol' Video Tapes.A Dystopia, right? very gloomy idea to the world without This novel,The One.Well, in the case you think I'm exaggerate..Let's have,ABrief !!History of Literature in the 90s-------------------------------Well, let’s back to early 90s , where TV is in every house, even in every room, Video sets are there too, rental video stores everywhere, satellite receivers and cable channels growing fast packed with channels for kids & teenagers, making them attached more & more into screens,not to mention Video Games, Game boy and Nintendo…Those of this new generation who read are “weirdos"" or ""nerds” to the rest of their peers.And for those “few who read”, book stores mostly got for them comics and graphic novels, which most of them created early this century.Classic Novels, they read just for Schools and Classes mostly.And New Novels that make Best Seller are the ones made, or will be made, into movies for Julia Roberts, Tom Cruse or any of the 90s Hollywood celebrity, or the ones by Stephen King because ,of course, will be made into movies too.Even these new novels didn't live up the selling numbers of Tolkien, Charles Dickens, Agatha Christie-what’s with the British authors and selling numbers :)?-, also in Russia no more Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, no more Hugo in France, inEgyptno more like Naguib Mahfouz & the great authors of the 50s to 70s..No new Big Hit for novels, most of the selling books are those of Speculation about strange & mysterious things in the world or in religion, Dream interpretation , cocking books or celebrities rumors.While in US & UK, Top Selling books mostly the Self Help ones, or those teaching Computers Programming and Web Sites-this brand new huge technology leap back then-No new novels to attract the new generation of kids and teenagers, There's few Successful Highlights though, like R.L.Stine’s Goosepumbs in 1992 which made a very good success, and translated in many countries including Egypt.And in Egypt there’s also a very successful project by respectful Publishing house that made “Pocket Novels” for youth, by brilliant Egyptian writers presenting huge variety of novels of many genres, Sci-Fi, Action Thriller, comics, Romance .etc.There’s also “Reading for All”, project by the first lady “Susan Mubarak”, reprinting a huge verity of important books and novels from all over the world in very cheap prices.But all these effort didn't attract “more and more” of new youth readers as intended, it just made more and more books for those few who already reads.The vast numbers of those who don’t just read will increase if there isn't a BIG new attractiveReading Experienceto get them into reading, specially with the more channels, more movies.But the BIGGEST Obstacle for them to read came out in1994, and became a real phenomenon by 1995....it’sPlaystation, The giant Japanese Gaming leap..Football, Crash, Pepsi man, even the comics heroes also have their games, so why reading Superman, Batman’s comics when you can play them..~~~~~~ A beat. ~~~~~~So by 1996, with this growing leap in Gaming, also the Computer 3D games getting much improved, Books get replaced bit by bit by a gaming controls.So do you think it’s wise for publishers to publish a book for new writer?Of course not, it may not even cover it’s publishing cost.So it was very normal when in this year, 1996, whenJoanne, a 31 years old lady from England , handed the manuscript of her first novel to 12 publishing houses, all of them rejected it...A manuscript of over 200 pages of a novel,that she had hard times in her personal and professional life while writing it,and for children??? Seriously is there still any Child left who still read? it’s 1996, the Era of Playstation and Video Games.But then, the Modest“Bloomsbury“agreed to publish it , with 2 advises for her, first that she’d get a day job, since it’s a little chance of making money in children's books.- later she received a grant from the Scottish Arts Council to help her continuing writing.-But the significant advice was to change her pen name cause young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman..So with her name & her grandmother’s ""Kathleen"" come the 2 initial of her pen name..J . k .

If You Give a Mouse a Cookie,"If you give a mouse a cookieis the story of the perversity of desire, and more particularly the stunted pleasures of thebourgeoisie. Written by the exquisite Laura Numeroff, in what can only be assumed was a violent passion for sterile aloofness from the society which she condemned, and a lust for concision which would socialize her treatise against the deadening wants, making it accessible to the masses. I can imagine her, unbathed, ignorant of her own hunger and thirst, cutting every insignificant word in a Flaubertian frenzy forle mot juste.The titular mouse is a scathing manifestation of our ruling, yet tirelessly servile, middle class – his small figure manifests the smallness of our self-worth, and the relative largesse of our smallest desires. Every visible aspect of the overall-clad hero hearkens us to the plight of the middle class in the late twentieth century. The mouse, like man, is easily won over to new “needs” – endlessly trying to fill the vacancy of his own heart, deadened by the loss of illusion, by the evaporation of virtue, and the brutalennuiof routine. But as the significantly unnamed mouse usurps his pleasures and whims from his remote human benefactors, we too usurp our desires. Whether from the conspicuous consumption of the upper classes, from the romantic visions of novels and television programming, or from the simple white noise of broadcast advertising, which we subconsciously mold into our own desires – desires for things which wedo not want. René Girard identifies this parallel with chilling accuracy to our present condition: ""The distance between Don Quixote and the petty bourgeois victim of advertising is not so great as romanticism would have us believe.” It is easy to replace “bourgeois victim” with our murine hero, raising to idolatry his search for false desires, which leads to a parodically circuitous odyssey of “want.”Numeroff’s story is one of deceptive simplicity, but with a jarring impact. In less than three-hundred words, she is captures the movement of emotion of her literary predecessors, primarily of French origin, though also hearkening back to the Homeric epics. Proust, James, Balzac, Dickens are among Numeroff’s literary forefathers, and her precision for language shows a heavy influence of Flaubert, contemporarily manifest in the logical exactitude of Truman Capote and Ernest Hemingway. Take or example the opening sequence:If you give a mouse a cookie,He’s going to ask for a glass of milk.When you give him the milk, he’ll probably ask you for a straw.When he’s finished, he’ll ask for a napkin.Then he will want to look in a mirror to make sure he doesn’t have a milk mustache.Immediately we are drawn into a contained cosmos of desire – which is postulated in a hypothetical, though illustrated in an ever-present reality. While we are kept somewhat distanced from our mouselike counterpart by the conditional, we are drawn in by the seeming reality of the action, the omniscience of the narrator, an almost godly knowing, reminds us of a master Chess player, foreseeing the hero’s moves, up to his ultimate epiphany, from the first line. We are acquainted with the mouse with such immediacy, we feel we know him, we feel as though he is a part of us, or perhaps more than we are – despite his size. Though we are removed from the hero’s consciousness, we feel he is both naïve of his circuitous desires, but also disturbingly manipulative. This contradiction, this naïvete matched with perturbing self-possession, concerns the reader –how aware am I of my own desires?We are moved, our uncertainty of the hero’s self-awareness is never satisfied. We observe the seeming naïvete and it enlightens us to our own short commings of self-awareness. “To see someone who does not see is the best way to be intensely aware of what he does not see” argued Barthes, and it is precisely the salient power ofIf you give a mouse a cookie.The godless landscape ofIf you give a mouse a cookieis one marked by a total secularization of morality and gratification. The parallels to our own secular society, in which we are diminished to figurative animals - beasts of pure will driven in the vain effort for satiety of our animalistic desires. Instead of a God, the world within the story is governed by a maternalistic hand - more reminiscent of Neo-Marxian doctrine of entitlement than it is to the classical Judeo-Chrisitan rule of centuries past. Instead of being ruled by virtue, or protagonist is ruled by the ever-demanding ""want!"" of his body. Cookies, milk, soft bedding, but no time for self reflection, no orison nor even secular gratitude is shared by our profane hero. We compare the mouse's struggle for ""want"" to the Defoe's struggle for need inRobinson Crusoe, and we are dismayed at the descent from virtue of our present day society, in which our vices and excesses have supplanted our virtues and reservations.In his gustatory pursuits, we observe his coy glances, his polite demeanor, but ultimately his ingratitude. And what disturbs us as the reader is his humanlike disposition, his canny vanity, his concern with appearances and hygienic preoccupations, and his servility to routine. His look into the pierglass is so human that one expects to see our diminutive friend the next time we check for our own milk-mustaches – the parodic symbol of self-indulgence and minor fall from poise. The vanity implicit in ourhéros de rongeursis startling parallel to our own fall from grace, manifest in Milton'sParadise Lost. Despite his many pleasures, his many ""wants"" they are startlingly mundane to us, they are self-serving but unambitious. He foregoes the search for self-discovery, for transcendent pleasure, for the pleasures of immediacy, which feed his vanity and his comfort. His look into the mirror reveals to us a world of pleasures forgone, given up, in the vain restraints of society, with which he is disturbingly complicit. His concern for his milk-mustache, his imagined need for a haircut - a purely imaginary need for our rodent friend, one which is purely vain and removed from true necessity, disturbs us, but warms us to him. He is made more human to us, but that is precisely the element which disturbs us and makes us question our own vain pursuits.But our hero’s desires are manifold. What begins as a novel of unhealthy appetite of necessity and hunger, become a hunger for a higher appetite: the hunger for the aesthetic.He’ll probably ask you to read him a story. So you’ll read him one from one of your books, and he’ll ask to see the pictures. When he looks at the pictures, he’ll get so excited he’ll want to draw one of his own. He’ll ask for paper and crayons.What began as low hierarchical needs (according to Maszlow), rises with expediency to needs of self-realization in his pursuit for artistic expression. This passage is the greatest drop of the mask of our narrator revealing her greater purpose: to expose the mimetic nature of our deepest desires. Upon hearing the story, which we imagine is the very story we are reading – a classical representation of the meta-literary play often attributed to post-modern writers, and seeing the illustrations, he is moved by a previously unknown desire. Due to the constrained world in which the narrative takes place –a small house, presumably in the suburbs, a set-manifestation of the class so brutally satirized – we must consider this desire within the constraint of the story. What moves our hero to request a bedtime story? We can only assume it is a routine he has usurped from his benefactors, a further emulation of their posh lives which they take for granted. The story is so moving to the mouse that he is immediately affected. What author can claim artistic impulse in a void? Certainly no contemporary author is without his or her literary influences. Literature too is circuitous in its search for the truth: every author seeks the “answers” behind his characters, behind his plot, behind the meaning of his life’s work, but each author usurps his questions from his literary forefathers (or foremothers). Where is literature without Homer? Without Sophocles or Plato, Plutarch? The question we are never answered is what moved the unnamed author of the unknown bedtime story to write it? We know only that ourbourgeoisprotagonist seeks emulation of that art.If you give a mouse a cookieends with an almost Borgesian nihilism: “Looking at the refrigerator will remind him that he’s thirsty so…he’ll ask for a glass of milk. And chances are if he asks for a glass of milk, he’s going to want a cookie to go with it.” Thus desire begets desire, begets desire – the search for fulfillment is endless, and our hero is left always hungry for something new, but can never identify what that is. We are left haunted by this “children’s” story, but the foolishness of the petite protagonist, who wants big things – but those “big things” seem very small to us. It makes the reader turn in upon himself/herself and wonder: what do I want? And what is the ultimate path of my “wants”? Can I ever be fulfilled or am I resigned to the mazy route of routine-desire?Imagine waking up to realize the fruition of your ultimate desire is only the begetting of more desires? Desires of things which youonly believe that you want? Chilling.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/767680.If_You_Give_a_Mouse_a_Cookie,If You Give a Mouse a Cookie.txt
The Kissing Hand,"Back when I was five years old, I never wanted summer to end. I wish my grandma had read this book to me before she took me to school on my first day to make me feel better. My best friend’s mother recommended this book to me as one she used to read to her own children and the message within the storyline continues to resonate around her entire family.Audrey Penn’s ‘The Kissing Hand’ deals with the issue of separation anxiety many children face when starting school as this is often the first and longest separation they have experienced from their parents or primary caregivers.Chester Raccoon begs Mrs. Raccoon to let him stay at home and play. In an attempt to comfort him, Mrs. Raccoon assures Chester that although the idea of a new school may be scary, there will be plenty of new things he will love there once he settles in. She shares a family secret by kissing his hand and wrapping his fingers around it, explaining that every time he feels lonely or far away from home, he could hold his hand to his cheek, knowing that his mother’s love was with him wherever he went. Outside the school gates on the first day (or night, in this case) Chester returns the same gesture to his mother, showing her that the kissing hand works both ways, since sometimes even adults need the same reassurance.Before publication in 1993, Audrey Penn had already read this story to many children in schools, libraries and children’s hospitals. By assigning animals the roles of the main characters, Penn is using anthropomorphism to personify the raccoon family with human characteristics, a strong literary device that particularly engages the attention of young children, but readers of any age could appreciate the central relationship in focus.Mrs. Raccoon and the family unit could be substituted for any significant person in the reader’s life, relating back to educational theorists such as John Bowlby’s idea of a secure base that leads to independence and Mary Ainsworth’s attachment types. With this in mind, the story can be adapted into any situation or relationship as a coping strategy to deal with change. For example, a child entering foster care, dealing with a parent away serving in the military, a death in the family, moving away from friends and loved ones or a even adoption.Vibrant watercolour illustrations by Ruth E. Harper and Nancy M. Leak accentuate the story, depicting the traditional autumn back to school season and the raccoon’s nocturnal habitat. Based on Penn’s own observation of animal behaviour, this book can be used as a cross-curricular starting point to explore the natural habitats and behaviour of other nocturnal animals. In the classroom, children between the ages of four to six can interpret their own meaning from the story and paint their own handprints in art activities, or listen to the book as an aid in the transition period between the Early Years and Key Stage one.They say never judge a book by it’s cover, but a great writer is able to appeal to many different audiences. Penn achieves this with her sensitive handling of a delicate subject that affects every young person at some stage, which explains the popularity of this New York Times #1 bestseller . Including the ASL sign for ‘I love you’ on the final page allows the universal moral of the story to be understood by everyone.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18419.The_Kissing_Hand,The Kissing Hand.txt
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"Mother nature cooks up a storm, literally, in this madcap story with plenty of silliness to go around.Ages 4-10The town of Chewandswallow has some wild weather, bringing meals like burgers, spaghetti, mashed potatoes, and of course meatballs three times a day. Then, things start to go crazy and odd things start happening, like an entire day of just gargonzola cheese and eventually a ""tomato tornado"" and the poor sanitation department could no longer keep up. This book uses such fun language to describe weather effects, like drizzle, clearings, and downpour. The language is delightful and the illustrations, while not overly colorful, are still detailed and fun. The absurdity and silliness in this story make it a joy to read and the combining of two familiar concepts, food and weather, into one story are sure to stoke the imagination. Kids of this age group will love the fanciful, over the top, giant ideas presented in this book.About This BookHere's another wonderfully written and illustrated story by the Barrett team. Receiving a place on the prestigious New York Times Best Illustrated Children's Books of the Year list, this book skillfully and subtly blends funny storytelling and full-color illustrations with a very real twist about how weather can affect people's environments.Life in the wonderful town of ChewandSwallow is great: Some of its citizens even say it's downright delicious! Instead of snow, wind, or rain, they get a different kind of weather that falls from the sky three times a day: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The only bad part about living in ChewandSwallow is that the people don't get their choice of what they'd like to fall from the sky: it may snow mashed potatoes, or rain juice or soup, or there might even be a storm of hamburgers that takes them by surprise. But no one is too worried about the weather, until it takes a turn for the worse — the portions of food get larger and larger and fall faster and faster, until everyone in the town fears for their lives. They all need to think of a plan, and they need one fast! With teamwork, smarts, and some extra-large bagels, Chewandswallow residents are able to save themselves from the torrential weather. A cheerful approach to gearing up for a science lesson or just for reading aloud, this book makes food and weather fun.A good review and I agree that it is a good starting point for a weather discussion, especially because of the great terms used in the story.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8073.Cloudy_with_a_Chance_of_Meatballs,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.txt
Charlotte’s Web,"This is some book!This well-known classic kids’ book is all it’s cracked up to be. Charlotte is the nicest, wisest spider you’ll ever meet. Wish I could think of sweet Charlotte the next time I see a creepy crawly spider, but I’m sure the memory of her will go right out the window and I’ll run for my life, as always!Everyone should read this book. Well, probably every one has. But true confession here: When my teacher read the book to our class over a few weeks, my 8-year-old self daydreamed off every time! Yep, that’s me: the attention span of a shoo-fly! How did I do this, I want to know, since now, reading it more than 60 years later, I was completely captivated.I guess I wanted to give back what I didn’t allow myself to receive way back when: an amazing, heart-wrenching read! So I read the book to Eliska, the 10-year-old I kid-sit for. She had liked the movie so was up for a read-aloud. I did NOT appreciate it when, half-way into the story, she proudly blurted out the sad ending. The stinker—she knew what she was doing and she just wanted to see my expression—which, of course, was pure shock and dismay. She thought she was hilarious; I wish she had gotten the memo on spoilers.There’s so much good about this story about two friends: a spider, Charlotte, and a pig, Wilbur. Talking animals, quite a trip. There are stuttering geese; a wise-guy rat. The best part was Charlotte writing in her web, in the hope that she could save Wilbur. I loved the words she chose and how she acquired them. Tickled me to death—so ingenious! A good lesson in the power of words, the power of language. The first thing Charlotte wrote in the web was SOME PIG.WARNING: The rest of this so-called review is just a true story about the drama (seriously, not important drama) that occurred while I read this book. Proceed if you want, but I won’t be insulted if you ignore it.While I read, Eliska always does some craft. Once she made rubber-band earrings that could have mutilated my ears, but luckily she warned me, and I removed them the second I left the premises. This time, she decided to give me a tattoo. Oh, she did ask first, as she dangled the tattoo pens in my face. When I hestitated, she assured me that the tattoo would wash right off. I nodded okay, and she went to town on my wrist. I figured the tattoo would be the size of a dime, but as I read about the fate of Charlotte and Wilbur, I saw out of the corner of my eye that it was a multi-colored flower the size of a post-it note. Hm—that thing is BIG! I agained ask if she was sure it would come off. This time her story changed a little. “Oh, in a couple of days, for sure,” she says. What??? It hits me that she has no idea whether it will come off! What have I let her do? Am I nuts? I subdued my freakout and kept my head inside Charlotte’s Web. How my reading voice stayed calm I do not know.Eliska was done, and I have to say the tattoo was pretty. Next, she started going crazy painting her fingers with mulit-colored stripes. At first I thought they looked cool, but then I started seeing them through a mom’s (her mom’s) eyes and I realized they were pretty ugly—loud and bright brass knuckles, except they didn’t cover just the knuckles. Every square inch of her fingers was soaked in marker pen. It suddenly occurred to me that maybe mom would not appreciate the fact that I let her kid write all over her hands. Maybe I was in deep doo-doo. I started getting antsy and I asked Eliska, “Are you SURE these wash off?” She promptly went and washed off one finger and returned. Huge blue spots like bruises were what remained. It looked like she had USED the brass knuckles, for crying out loud. She giggled nervously as I gasped. “Well, if you scrub it with one of those hard brushes that you wash dirty nails with, more will come off,” she said. Like this would reassure me. We all know those brushes are nasty! Scrubbing my old wrist might scrub off the skin for all I know. We’re talking pain. And where to find such a brush in the first place? I don’t have one lying around.Freakout time! At this point I was more worried about Eliska’s painted fingers than my tattoo. What if her mom was furious? What kind of babysitter lets a kid drench her skin with ink? Maybe Eliska liked this new look so much that she’ll become a badass when she’s 18 and cover her body in tattoos. Her mom will blame me for sure—the babysitter with no sense, the babysitter who was too busy reading Charlotte’s Web to notice the kid ruining her soft, clear skin with ugly ink.Aha moment: maybe I should have had Eliksa draw graffiti on me that said, SOME BABYSITTER. Maybe instead of her mom being mad at me for letting Eliska loose with tattoo pens, she’d be impressed. Just like the world was impressed that Charlotte had written SOME PIG and it had saved Wilbur’s life.Yep, maybe a SOME BABYSITTER tattoo would save my job. I threw the idea out to Eliska, who was in the middle of deciding whether her next finger should have three or four stripes. She thought I was nuts—what was wrong with the beautiful flower she painted? Writing words wouldn’t be any fun! And come to think of it, it depends on how you interpret SOME BABYSITTER anyway. If you emphasize the “some,” you could mean “that was SOME babysitter, alright. She was a humdinger!” (i.e., bad). So maybe it was best that I didn’t steal Charlotte’s idea after all.It was the dad who came home and I didn’t see him notice Eliska’s hands. You better believe I was glad that it wasn’t mom who walked in that door. But I never heard a word about it. No news is good news. Eliska must have had an easier time removing the ink than I had thought.What about my tattoo? When I got home, I looked at it a lot but I didn’t try to remove it right away. I was afraid that if I did, I’d have a blue blob, like Eliska’s painted finger. I was trying to ignore it so that I’d chill. It didn’t help when my husband glanced at my arm and said, “What? You got a TATTOO?” No way I could pretend it never happened. I told him the story, adding, “It will wash right off,” though I didn’t for a second believe it. He was so excited, he took pictures and sent it out to our daughters, “Look, mom got a tattoo!” It horrified me that it looked that real. If the tattoo looks so real, does that mean it’s permanent? I kept telling myself that there was no way that Eliska’s mom would allow her to have permanent markers in the house, no way.I fretted—should I wait a few days before I tried to wash it off? No, that would be torture. I needed to know now. So after a few hours, I tried. And damn if the tattoo, the beautiful tattoo, didn’t disappear—completely. No scrubbing necessary, and no blue blob in sight.You know, I’ll always think of the tattoo whenever I think about Charlotte’s Web. That was some book. Wilbur was some pig. I was some babysitter.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24178.Charlotte_s_Web,Charlotte’s Web.txt
The Day the Crayons Came Home,"What I like most about Drew Daywalt and Oliver Jeffers The Day The Crayons Came Home is how freakin’ utterly hilarious this book is.By Tan, I was laughing so hard I had to stop reading to catch my breath.Esteban the Magnificent popping in along this journey in stand up comedy terms is dubbed ”a callback”. I'm in love with this little guy. BUT you’ll have to read the book with a little to find out which color he is.Poor Tan (teaser alert) can't tell what color it is anymore, ”Have you ever been eaten by a dog and puked up on the living room rug? Because I have... ” 🤣🤣🤣This poor little remainder of what used to be a beloved brand new crayon is beyond humiliated.Drew and Oliver have given me new author goals. I hope my series shared by me will insight belly laughs as much as this book has.I've read a LOT of children’s books to students. Adding personality. Such as Sandra Boynton’s Barnyard Dance with me doing a Square Dance style caller while dancing as a square dancer would always make the children laugh. Even older students.This inspired an idea for an activity, everyone picks a crayon and perform the plot. While attempting to read the parts. I'm falling on the floor laughing imagining this in real life occurring already.Better yet, have the children make their crayon costumes. To make it fair because everyone will want to perform, make groups of children be different colors, and write their silly parts OR divide the class into the number of colors for this book. Then, put them into book groups. Each group will memorize and act out their color.Plus, you can have a group of children draw the postcards and act as a postcard, too. Play the game, ”Where in the world is Neon Red Crayon?” Read to see why this question works for a geography and social studies exploration.So many ways to go about this creatively. Decide the education themes for what categories. Such as, we are studying: art, social studies, and also discuss the postal system and geography.Cross-curriculum will make this a very fun way to learn about many interesting places.If there are people who want to be more than one color or assignment there's no reason why children can't try different roles. This gives them a diversity of experiences and helps them explore how we do throughout our education as we get older.Even in college, we have mandatory classes on topics we will never use ever. But, are forced to take, pay for, and master to get value according to the standards required. If we want a diploma. While guiding us to our true path.Like, for me ending up here sharing with you. Began illiterate. Struggling was discouraged by my first college English teacher, ”You’re not college material”.Joined the military full time and studied hard to improve reading, vocabulary, and took easier college classes like library studies and typing.Finally, in four years mastered the craft of reading and writing enough to return to college full time while being in the military part-time.Still working hard to improve literacy along the way. Graduated with elementary education and later early childhood certification where I earned a 4.0 because in my heart want to be the best for those I'm working toward being an empathetic author to this beautiful world of children.Beginning with children from the get go, we can mentor them to see they can be anyone they wanna be, BUT this might not always be an easy journey.Along the way when bumps happen can hurdle their difficulties, like the crayons, will find their way when they put their minds to the task and work hard to get to where they wanna be. If I can do it, I'm sure any little can.Especially when they have caring adults like you to support them with cool books and activities to help develop their brains, choices, and creativity along the way.We can help children prepare for these roads in life in fun ways as littles since they'll explore options and learn to pick a favorite. How else do we know it's our preference until we try things we don't like as well?This books takes me back to my teaching days. When I met my first group of crayons in the original, the Day the Crayons Quit. This sequel is funnier to me as I don't remember laughing as hard while surrounded by students. I'm alone reading to review cracking up. So I know this is real hilarity as I'm a grown-up in my 50’s.Who says we're ever too old to read a children’s book is clueless of its joy at any age. Especially for an aspiring children’s series writer 😊Borrowed from the library on the Overdrive app. The version was delivered to my Kindle.What I learned is this particular book on kindle sucks if you've never used a Kindle before. Because the postcards are written in crayon I couldn't see the tiny print well.It took an accident of fate to figure out if I tap the page twice segments of the text will pop out. Then, I have to tap twice again for the next section to pop out to read. And so on. Including to see small non-crayon writing.This style book is preferred in the paper version for me for sure. It's so good I'm buying a copy to do a verified review on Amazon. And, if I'm fortunate enough to ever have grandkids this is so being passed down to them.As grown as my son is in his late 20’s and recently married, I'm even thinking of reading it to him because he'll crack up.Books have always been our thing as a family. This definitely would have been one of our favorites. Who knows, can still be someday 😂Favorite highlights for me, although there could be some you identify can add to this review on Goodreads or elsewhere: using untypical colors personified. Comedic callbacks as previously touched on. Engaging the different theme potential for cross-curriculum exploration. Hilarity on steroids.Almost forgot, science exploration is possible as the story mentions the sun and a conundrum two color's face who use to argue until... Read to find out more. Poor yellow and orange.The list of favorite highlights is SO LONG Imma have to encourage you to read and see for yourself.I'm not sure why while reading the postcards from the various colors did each show up in a different audible voice in my head. As though I can hear their personalities. This, for me, is the greatest beauty of all the highlights and attributes of this classic.Another book on colors for young children is Mary O’Neill’s Hailstones and Halibut Bones: Adventures in Poetry and Color. In this book the story was developed, and if you've heard the backstory, was made into a book by accident. Eventually being used to help blind people ”see” color.If I recollect correctly, the publisher stopped by and asked about Mary’s writing and she gave permission to look through her notes. Like lots of writers Mary collected pieces of paper with lots of notes. Within the piles were vivid descriptions of colors using foods to things like trees.Like, roast beef could represent brown and so on.Compiled, these scraps of descriptions formed a book that now makes the world a more lovely place to see through the imaginations of blind people everywhere who read.The illustrations are beautiful for us sighted folks, too.Overall, this or other children’s books from Drew and Oliver are a silly way to engage children creatively. Well worth a borrow from the library or purchase for a gift.Once finished, share snacks and discuss open-ended questions about personification and made-up personalities of the colors.The final activity at the end the book is explore two skills: empathy and kindness. Qualities the world ALWAYS needs every day.Compare how Duncan realized his choices hurt his crayons and how he solved these problems.Ask questions of the children on what some of their problems are and discover ways that work and don't to make models of future options that will help the littles be successful decision makers and treat their friends and belongings with more respect and understanding.Ask children to pick a color and make up a story about the color from how they'd imagine they would feel if left behind, or forgotten in a pocket only to end up in the dryer, used a lot, or a little. The possibilities for open ended questions transformed into projects is endless with this series.The possibilities are unlimited on where these answers can lead children.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐��⭐️ 💯❤️",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23310161-the-day-the-crayons-came-home,The Day the Crayons Came Home.txt
The Giving Tree,"The Giving Tree, Shel SilversteinThe Giving Tree is a children's picture book written and illustrated by Shel Silverstein. First published in 1964 by Harper & Row, it has become one of Silverstein's best known titles and has been translated into numerous languages.The book follows the lives of an apple tree and a boy, who develop a relationship with one another. The tree is very ""giving"" and the boy evolves into a ""taking"" teenager, a middle-aged man, and finally an elderly man. Despite the fact that the boy ages in the story, the tree addresses the boy as ""Boy"" his entire life.In his childhood, the boy enjoys playing with the tree, climbing her trunk, swinging from her branches, carving ""Me + T (Tree)"" into the bark, and eating her apples.However, as the boy grows older, he spends less time with the tree and tends to visit her only when he wants material items at various stages of his life, or not coming to the tree alone (such as bringing a lady friend to the tree and carving ""Me +Y.L."" (her initials, often assumed to be an acronym for ""young love"")) into the tree.In an effort to make the boy happy at each of these stages, the tree gives him parts of herself, which he can transform into material items, such as money (from her apples), a house (from her branches), and a boat (from her trunk).With every stage of giving, ""the Tree was happy"". ...تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز چهاردهم ماه می سال 2009میلادیعنوان: درخت بخشنده؛ نویسنده: شل سیلورستاین؛ مترجم: سیما مجیدزاده؛ مشهد، گل آفتاب، 1383 در 55ص؛ شابک 9645599326؛ چاپ هفتم 1388؛ چاپ دهم 1392، شابک 9789645599322؛ موضوع داستانهای خیال انگیز از نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 20ممترجم: هایده کروبی؛ تهران، انتشارات فنی ایران، 1385، در 36ص؛ شابک: 9643891739؛مترجم: مونا ماشی؛ تهران، ماشی، 1387، در یک جلد؛ شابک 9786009060184؛مترجم: کمال برزگر بفرویی؛ قم، فراکاما، 1390، در 52ص؛ شابک9786009241309؛مترجم: امیرحسین مهدی زاده؛ تهران، نشر نو، آسیم، 1392، در 58ص؛ شابک9789647443784؛مترجم: کمال مرادی؛ تهران، پلک، 1392، در 104ص؛ شابک9789642862290؛مترجم: صفورا نراقی؛ تهران، البرز فر دانش، 1393 ، در 44ص؛ شابک9786002022622؛مترجم: هرمز ریاحی؛ تهران، انتشارات خروس، 1391 ، در 58ص؛ شابک9786009453924؛سیلور استاین، نام آوری خویش را به عنوان نویسنده ی ادبیات کودکان؛ مدیون همین کتاب است؛ داستانی درباره: یکی که میبخشد، و دیگری که میستاند؛ داستان در مورد درختی ست که «سایه»، «میوه»، «شاخه» و حتی «کنده اش» باعث شادی پسرکی میشودمتن داستان درخت بخشنده و مهربانروزی روزگاری درختی بود ….؛ و پسر کوچولویی را دوست میداشت؛ پسرک هر روز میآمد، برگهایش را جمع میکرد؛ از آنها تاج میساخت، و شاه جنگل میشد؛ از تنه اش بالا میرفت؛ از شاخه هایش آویزان میشد، و تاب میخورد، و سیب میخورد؛ با هم قایم باشک بازی میکردند؛ پسرک هر وقت خسته میشد زیر سایه اش میخوابید؛ او درخت را خیلی دوست میداشت؛ خیلی زیاد؛ و درخت خوشحال بود؛ اما زمان میگذشت؛ پسرک بزرگ میشد؛ و درخت بیشتر تنها بود؛ تا یک روز پسرک نزد درخت آمد؛ درخت گفت: «بیا پسر، ازتنه ام بالا بیا، و با شاخه هایم تاب بخور، سیب بخور، و در سایه ام بازی کن، و خوشحال باش.»؛ پسرک گفت: «من دیگر بزرگ شده ام، بالا رفتن و بازی کردن، کار من نیست؛ میخواهم چیزی بخرم، و سرگرمی داشته باشم؛ من به پول احتیاج دارم؛ میتوانی کمی پول به من بدهی؟»؛ درخت گفت: «متاسفم، من پولی ندارم»؛ من تنها برگ و سیب دارم؛ سیبهایم را به شهر ببر بفروش؛ آن وقت پول خواهی داشت، و خوشحال خواهی شد؛ پسرک از درخت بالا رفت؛ سیبها را چید و برداشت و رفت؛ درخت خوشحال شد؛ اما پسرک دیگر تا مدتها بازنگشت …؛ و درخت غمگین بود؛ تا یکروز پسرک برگشت؛ درخت از شادی تکان خورد؛ و گفت «بیا پسر، از تنه ام بالا بیا، با شاخه هایم تاب بخور، و خوشحال باش»؛ پسرک گفت: «آنقدر گرفتارم که فرصت بالا رفتن از درخت را ندارم، زن و بچه میخواهم، و به خانه احتیاج دارم؛ میتوانی به من خانه بدهی؟»؛ درخت گفت: «من خانه ای ندارم؛ خانه ی من جنگل است؛ ولی تو میتوانی شاخه هایم را ببری؛ و برای خود خانه ای بسازی و خوشحال باشی»؛ آنوقت پسرک شاخه های درختش را برید و برد، تا برای خود خانه ای بسازد؛ و درخت خوشحال بود؛ اما پسرک دیگر تا مدتها بازنگشت؛ و وقتی برگشت، درخت چنان خوشحال شد، که زبانش بند آمد؛ با اینحال به زحمت زمزمه کنان گفت: «بیا پسر، بیا و بازی کن»؛ پسرک گفت: «دیگر آنقدر پیر و افسرده شده ام، که نمیتوانم بازی کنم؛ قایقی میخواهم، که مرا از اینجا ببرد، به جایی دور، میتوانی به من قایق بدهی؟؛ درخت گفت: «تنه ام را قطع کن و برای خود قایقی بساز؛ آن وقت میتوانی با قایقت از اینجا دور شوی؛ و خوشحال باشی»؛ پسر تنه ی درخت را قطع کرد؛ قایقی ساخت، و سوار بر آن از آنجا دور شد؛ و درخت خوشحال بود؛ پس از زمانی دراز، پسرک بار دیگر بازگشت، خسته، تنها و غمگین؛ درخت پرسید «چرا غمگینی؟ ای کاش میتوانستم کمکت کنم؛ اما دیگر نه سیب دارم، نه شاخه، حتی سایه هم ندارم برای پناه دادن به تو»؛ پسر گفت: «خسته ام از این زندگی، بسیار خسته و تنهام؛ و فقط نیازمند با تو بودن هستم، آیا میتوانم کنارت بنشینم؟»؛ درخت خوشحال شد، و پسرک پیر، کنار درخت نشست، و در کنار هم زندگی کردند؛ و سالیان سال، در غم و شادی به زندگی ادامه دادند؛ …)؛ پایاندوستان خوبم، آیا شرح داستان، چیزی به یاد ما نمیآورد؟ بیشتر ما شبیه پسرک همین داستان هستیم، و با مادر، و پدر خود، چنین رفتاری داریم؛ درخت همان مادر و پدر ماهاست، تا وقتی کوچکیم، دوست داریم با آنها بازی کنیم؛ سپس تنهایشان میگذاریم، و دوباره زمانی به سویشان برمیگردیم، که نیازمند هستیم و گرفتار، برای مادر و پدر خود، وقت نداریم، آیا تا به حال به این فکر کرده ایم، که مادر و پدر، برای ما همه چیز را فراهم میکنند، تا ما را شاد نگاه دارند، و با مهربانی چاره ای برای رفع مشکلمان، پیدا میکنند، و تنها چیزی که در عوض از ما میخواهند، این است که تنهایشان نگذاریم؛ به مادر خود عشق بورزیم، و به پدر، احترام بگذاریم، فراموششان نکنیم؛ برایشان زمان اختصاص دهیم؛ همراهیشان کنیم؛ شادی آنها در دیدن روی ماهاست؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 17/06/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 20/05/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/370493.The_Giving_Tree,The Giving Tree.txt
Pete the Cat: Rocking in My School Shoes: A Back to School Book for Kids,"Pete the Cat: Rocking in My School Shoes by Eric Litwin (2011) Illustrated by James DeanJoin Pete the cat as he rocks his school shoes through the classroom, library, lunchroom, playground, and even the bus! Written by author, musician, and song-writer Eric Litwin, the reading of the book evokes a musical tune as Pete’s “rocking his school shoes” refrain is repeated at every location he visits. Beautifully illustrated with paintings by James Dean, the lines, color, and texture transport readers to Pete’s side on his journey through school with his special shoes. The illustrations vary in perspective from wide angles to zoom-in shots as well as multiple collages that allow readers to see just how busy Pete the cat is rocking his school shoes. Text fonts vary in size and color and serve to accentuate the illustrations as well set up a visually easy-to-read storyline. Inside covers of the book display Pete on the bus, and the outside hard-covers of the book reviewed, were colorful and have an eye-catching glossy finish. While this book has the approximate page count typical of a picture book. It is important to note that none of the pages are numbered. This might be problematic with young readers learning numbers and sequences, but it does not detract from the book aesthetically or from a storyline/arc perspective. A fun-to-read book with lively, colorful artwork, and one of the many Pete the Cat books in a large series, this book would make a good addition to any primary school library or kindergarten class.Awards: South Carolina Book Award for Picture Book (2014), Monarch Award (2013)Target Audience: Pre-k to 2nd grade or ages 3-7",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9466024-pete-the-cat,Pete the Cat Rocking in My School Shoes A Back to School Book for Kids.txt
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"(A-) 84%| Very GoodNotes:All whimsy, vim, if pretty Grimm, on getting just desserts, where self-control's a safety goal and manners never hurt.*Check out progress updates for detailed commentary:Progress updates:01/11/2025- Preamble(1) One of my yearly reading goals is to finish at least one ""household name"" novel.- I don't mean the YA novel de jour practically no one outside Goodreads has even heard of. I mean a novel pretty much everyone's heard of.- For various reasons, everyone's heard of this book.(2) I've never seen either film, nor any adaptation, so this will be completely new to me.01/14/2025- Chapters 1–12(1) For Charlie, unlike the other children, buying chocolate bars expressly to find a Golden Ticket didn't work. It was only when he was at the point of starvation and bought the chocolate for food did he ultimately find one.- It's a double-whammy, conflating our good feeling about him finally finding a ticket with him overcoming starvation.- It's the difference between avarice/gluttony as a motivation versus pure necessity/desperation.(2) Twice at the very start, even before the story begins, we have descriptions of all the children, once in paragraph form and once in point form.- It's drilled in your head from the outset how each child is distinct and memorable.- Definitely one-note characterizations, but it's essential base-level understanding that can be built upon. J.K. Rowling did pretty much the same thing with the Hogwarts students, where a lot of them have very ethnic names, which on the one hand can be seen as stereotypical but on the other hand are instantly evocative and distinctive.- One of my pet peeves is when supporting characters aren't distinctive at all, names don't really mean anything and everyone's just amorphous background players. I remember this being a frustration I had withThe Ballad of Songbirds and Snakeswhere it was difficult to tell Clemensia from Lysistrata and Persephone.(3) It's an awful weird feeling to see several characters here not only described as ""fat"" but preposterously so.- You'd never see that today, especially in a kid's book.(4) Charlie's four grandparents here are all in their 90s, which is quite the generation gap with Charlie.- Presumably, his parents would be about 40-50.- The grandparents also seem to be contemporaries with Willy Wonka. They're the ones, not the parents, who are in awe and tell stories about him from the distant past... or at least before they were all bedridden some twenty years prior. This suggests that Willy Wonka is also around 90, or else he's some sort of immortal.(5) Prince Pondicherry's palace seems to be a kind of fable about being careful what you wish for, like a modern King Midas tale.- Presumably, the whole episode was intended as a lesson by Wonka, since if he can make ice cream that doesn't melt, then he can surely make chocolate that doesn't melt either.- It also suggests that Wonka is a magical figure, possibly a trickster god, because he builds the palace quick enough that it doesn't melt from the Indian heat but where it quickly and completely melts down soon after.(6) ""And of course now, when Mr. Wonka invents some new and wonderful candy, neither Mr. Fickelgruber nor Mr. Prodnose nor Mr. Slugworth nor anybody else is able to copy it.""- I appreciate the liberal and correct application of ""nor,"" which you hardly ever see nowadays. It sees extensive use throughout this book.(7) At the outset, we're teased with the mystery of what's behind the locked doors of Wonka's factory.- Thousands of workers are suddenly replaced by mysterious and minute shadowy figures.- Obviously, the factory is never subject to health inspections.(8) One thing Dahl is exceptional at is setting up expectations, almost belaboring them, only to suddenly subvert them. It's the ability to make mundane things seem miraculous.- Charlie fails to find the Golden Ticket three separate times before he finally does.- Grandpa Joe is the oldest of the grandparents and hasn't left his bed for twenty years before he jumps out of bed and begins to dance.(9) Charlie finds a dollar bill in the street, later he receives change in dimes, which I suppose means that this takes place in America, unless there's a separate British version.- I'd always presumed British authors set their stories in Britain, no less because of the British grammar and vernacular.- It's meant I've had to change the accents in my head when reading this.- Alternatively, we could be in an alternate history where, probably post-WWII, the UK adopted American currency.01/15/2025- Chapters 13–21(1) ""'Are the Oompa-Loompas really joking, Grandpa?' asked Charlie. 'Of course they're joking,' answered Grandpa Joe. 'They must be joking. At least, I hope they're joking. Don’t you?'""- Grandpa Joe's ""I hope they're joking"" signals that they may not be. It casts an ominous sliver of doubt over the Oompa-Loompas and by extension Willy Wonka.- Awful things are happening to children in this wonderland and it's slowly turned from wonderous to dangerous.(2) Willy Wonka's described as wearing a black hat and sporting a black goatee. Which isn't an image that quite correlates with popular conceptions.- The black goatee makes him seem devious, devilish even.- Though the plum velvet coat and bottle green trousers are on point.(3) The initial scenes in the chocolate factory are just bursting with energy and enthusiasm.- The whole thing's treated like a circus and Willy Wonka's like the happiest, most manic, ring master.(4) The Oompa-Loompas are tiny men with rosy-white skin and long golden-brown hair.- Again, completely different from the image that's been engrained in my head. I'd never have imagined Smurf-sized Tarzans.- It's fairly clear that Oompa-Loompas were inspired by African pygmy tribes. Though, as with most things here, they're inherently contradictory. For example, they live in the jungle and men only wear deer skins. I'm no zoologist, but I don't think jungle deer are a thing. The place they're native to in no way correlates to the world we know.(5) For a children's book, the humor here is pretty dark. Especially when it comes to the songs Oompa-Loompas sing.- They sing about Augustus Gloop being ground up, sliced, boiled and turned into fudge.- They sing about Violet Beauregarde biting her tongue in two, going dumb, and spending the rest of her days in a sanatorium.- It's the sort of stuff you'd expect out of The Brothers Grimm, except these are only jokes and don't actually happen.(6) Willy Wonka warns Mike Teavee not to lick the candy boat because it will get sticky.- But, it's a boat... it's meant to get wet.- Though, perhaps the river being chocolate means it won't act as a solvent.(7) Willy Wonka's whole ""nothing to see here"" attitude as they sail through the tunnel got some audible laughs from me.- Cracks are beginning to form in his immaculate facade and we get hints of nefarious goings on.(8) Charlie and Grandpa Joe are offered cups of river chocolate by Willy Wonka. They're the only ones out of the whole group.- Unlike the other children, Charlie only takes chocolate or sweets when offered. The children who take without asking suffer humiliating and potentially life-threatening consequences.- Like fables and folk stories of old, this is very much a cautionary tale for children: listen to adults, don't take what isn't yours, don't be impulsive or greedy. In other words, act like Charlie, and not the others, and you won't be sucked-up/stuck-in vacuum tubes or swell up into a giant blue ball.01/16/2025- Chapters 22–30(1) The Oompa-Loompas get drunk on butterscotch and buttergin.- Predictable, really. They're quite literally lightweights.- Makes me wonder if Hogwarts students regularly get drunk on butterbeer.- This story's definitely got Grimm sensibilities. Outright drunkenness or alcoholism isn't something you really see in modern children's fiction.(2) Willy Wonka's kind of a nasty piece of work. He has no tolerance for the ill-mannered, yet he outright scolds two of the three remaining children in front of their parents.- He scolds Mike Teavee for mumbling and interrupting and Veruca Salt for being impatient.- It's revealed at the very end, but it's quite clear here, that Willy Wonka has no children. The fact that he expects kids to act like adults and doesn't have any patience or grace for any sort of childishness only telegraphs this. An ironic attitude for a candy-maker.(3) The ""square candies that look round"" is the first instance of outright magic and/or magical creatures here. Up to this point, everything's been relatively real-world plausible, or arguably science fiction.- It's clearly an intentional cross into the fantastic, since the same pun of ""squares that look"" could have been achieved by something sciency or mechanical. Instead, Oompa-Loompas literally paint faces on square candies that subsequently come alive. It implies the Oompa-Loompas too are perhaps magical creatures.(4) Veruca's fate for being an impulsive and entitled brat is to be swarmed and pinned down by squirrels and then dumped down a garbage chute toward an incinerator, which is pretty horrifying.- Willy Wonka just laughs it off like some inhuman space alien or deity: amused if unconcerned with human welfare. Which contrasts with his over-concern with manners and politeness.(5) The whole thing gets veryHunger Gamestoward the end.- Kids drop one by one, in big and showy fashion, until it's just Charlie and Mike Teavee left.(6) Willy Wonka reveals that he eats cabbage and potatoes, not candy as you'd expect.- Definitely a dealer who's careful not to get high off his own supply.- If you remember from the very start of the book, cabbage and potatoes are the only food Charlie and his family can afford to eat. Here we get a direct correlation between Wonka and Charlie's family which suggests an underlying affinity despite outward differences in temper, energy and ostentation.- It's yet another subverted expectation, which this book has no shortage of.(7) ""Charlie experienced a queer sense of danger. There was something dangerous about this whole business, and the Oompa-Loompas knew it.""- Wait,nowhe senses danger? The book's almost over.- Seems to me, the whole thing became one big flashing red light of danger the moment Augustus Gloop fell into the chocolate river and got sucked into the factory pipes.(8) Mike Teavee's parents worry about him being split into pieces from teleportation gone awry.- Seems an awful lot like getting splinched inHarry Potter.- I can understand Mike Teavee's television watching obsession as a primary character motivation, but I don't know if that necessarily translates to literal transmission through the airwaves. It's not as one-to-one as Augustus Gloop's need to eat or Violet Beauregarde's need to chew gum or Veruca Salt's need to get everything she desires.(9) The Oompa-Loompa's song about Mike Teavee is double-length.- The first half is the usual dark mockery, but the second half almost seems like an anti-television/pro-reading propaganda piece or campaign ad.- You could easily replace TV with smart phones and convey exactly the same sentiment to modern audiences. Though, I guess it's basically the same idea. The main difference being that you can't just decide to watch TV in the middle of a conversation. TV watching is a more focused activity whereas smart devices are more intermittent.(10) This edition ends with sample sections fromMatilda, which I'll just skip since I already plan to read it sometime down the line.(11) Ultimately, I feel around the same way about this as I did with the firstHarry Potterbook: it's wildly imaginative, clever, and close to a 5-star read for most of it, but ends pretty flat and a bit of a letdown.- I actually see a whole lot of J.K. Rowling in Dahl, who I can only guess was a major influence on her work.- Still, a great story and an unequivocal recommendation. For me, it just finished a bit too conventionally ""happily ever after,"" whereas the book had been hitherto wildly unconventional, mischievous and sardonic.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6310.Charlie_and_the_Chocolate_Factory,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.txt
"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe","CALIFICACIÓN REAL:2.5 estrellasA través de un armario mágico, cuatro hermanos londinenses llegan al gélido mundo de Narnia. Pero, aquel mundo lleva incontables años siendo azotado por un cruel encantamiento impuesto por la Bruja Blanca, el cual hace que siempre sea invierno. No obstante, hay una profecía que indica que estos niños serán los salvadores de dicho reino; por lo que se embarcarán en la aventura de sus vidas, una que jamás hubiesen imaginado vivir, de manera que, tendrán que batallar en contra de las fuerzas del mal, para así poder cumplir con sus ya marcados y profetizados destinos: el de otorgarle la merecida prosperidad al sufrido país de Narnia.Primero que todo, debo aclarar queEl león, la bruja y el armarioes un título muchísimo más básico y sencillo que su predecesor. La historia que ahora se nos presenta es bonita y con una ambientación acorde para una obra de esta naturaleza, e igualmente se destaca en su rapidez por saltar enseguida a la acción o a lo que es de interés, pues, en las primeras páginas, Lucy ya incursiona en Narnia.Sin embargo, la terminación de los capítulos no suele enganchar ni se hacen atrapantes como para querer continuar de inmediato con el siguiente, tal como sí ocurría y de una forma muy bien lograda en el libro anterior. Puede que esto se deba a que no es una obra ideada con una intención del todo comercial, cosa que se nota; ya que fue concebida como un regalo para la ahijada del autor, lo que podría jugarle un poco en contra a esta entrega.Cambiando de tema, si leen mi reseña deEl sobrino del mago, podrán ver que allí habían varias alegorías y paralelismos con el cristianismo, y que aquí también las hay, pero en menor medida y complementado con otras culturas. Por ejemplo: hay varias referencias a criaturas y divinidades grecorromanas; así como también, hay más de algo alusivo a seres y eventos de otras mitologías, como la germánica o céltica. Esto se ve reflejado en el encantamiento de Narnia, ya que, de algún modo, me da la sensación de que este eterno invierno estaría inspirado en elFimbulvetrnórdico; así como el sacrificio de Aslan y lo que posteriormente le sucede con la Mesa de Piedra, claramente son una representación de la crucifixión y resurrección de Cristo, ni tampoco descuidar que dicha mesa recuerda a Stonehenge; además, creo que Edmund podría simbolizar a Judas, aunque con una redención; y la batalla final, que, aunque apenas sea mencionada, es el típico cliché del bien contra el mal tan común del judeo-cristianismo: el blanco y el negro, la luz y la oscuridad.Y nuevamente, así como en la entrega anterior, hay un par de incoherencias, pero en esta ocasión no son tan mínimas ni insignificantes. Por ejemplo: se menciona que Aslan es hijo del ‘’Gran Emperador’’, figura que aparentemente se trata de Dios, cosa que no me parece mal. El problema es que ese dato está fuera de lugar, ya que, enEl sobrino del mago, apenas se da información sobre Aslan como para que nos restrieguen en la cara el datorandomde quién es su padre, cuando nunca antes se había mencionado algo sobre ese tal ‘’emperador’’. Por ahora, este pequeño dato queda en el aire, pero espero que no continúe así en los demás títulos.Asimismo, la ‘’magia insondable’’ es la cual permite que Aslan pueda revivir torciendo la profecía referente a las traiciones, y se dice que fue puestagracias a ‘’la magia del emperador’’ desde un comienzo; pero, si consideramos que el libro anterior es sobre el origen cosmogónico y fundacional de Narnia, y que así supimos cómo se creó tal mundo, de antemano sabemos que todo fue 100% obra de Aslan, ya que no se mencionó algo sobre las leyes o magias que iban a regir en estos confines. Lo único que podría considerarse así en cierto modo, fue la mención de que el poder de la bruja aumentaría en muchos años más. Y, aun así, se tomaron las medidas pertinentes con respecto al árbol que protegería a Narnia de ella; pero tampoco se nos dice algo sobre ese árbol tan especial ni qué le sucedió para que Jadis pudiese acercarse. Esta ‘’magia insondable’’ se siente como otro elemento descontextualizado que se contradice con lo del primer libro, ya que tampoco se mencionó algo relacionado a eso ni mucho menos al emperador poniendo su magia. Y si analizamos los diálogos, podemos notar que hay una clara jerarquía en la que Aslan está por debajo de ese tal emperador.Por otra parte, esto me perturbó un poco, pues, se da a entender de que nunca ha habido humanos en Narnia; pero ¿qué hay de Polly, Digory y el tío Andrew?, ¿o del cochero y su esposa, que luego serían los primeros reyes narnianos para tener mucha descendencia? Es como si los hubiesen borrado de la historia, ya que por algo el humano es un mito en el mundo de Narnia. Y sí, ya sé que los libros no fueron publicados cronológicamente, pero no puedo dejar pasar estas incoherencias, que igual afectan la experiencia en cualquiera que sea el orden de lectura que escojan para la saga.Asimismo, ¿la reina acaso conocía algún camino hacia el mundo de los humanos? Es lo que se da a entender, ya que ella le dice a Edmund hacia donde ir cuando él le indica que no sabe ni recuerda cómo regresar a su propio mundo. Si tanto interés tenía la bruja por la Tierra (cosa que solo se enfatiza en el primer libro), ¿por qué nunca intentó venir si supuestamente ya conocía alguna supuesta ruta hacia nuestro mundo?Otra cuestión similar a lo anterior es con respecto al profesor mencionando algo así como que ‘’no se puede regresar a Narnia por la misma vía’’. El problema es que Lucy ya había usado esa misma vía tres veces y Edmund dos... Pero, claro, quizá la excepción a esto se deba a que la profecía tenía que cumplirse sí o sí; pero ¿cómo se enteró de esto? No recuerdo que ese dato se haya mencionado en el libro predecesor, en donde el profesor ostentaba el rol protagónico. Y hablando de este personaje, con su tan poca participación que tiene en esta ocasión, siento que en algunos comentarios o en su forma de expresarse, podría evocar alguna reminiscencia hacia su tío Andrew (salvando la distancia entre la personalidad e intenciones de ambos), lo cual es algo que me agradó.Por último, enEl sobrino del mago, vemos que Aslan le da el don de la palabra a un selecto grupo de especies animales, estos son: castores, leopardos, ciervos, conejos, topos, elefantes, caballos (por Fresón/Alado), cuervos, búhos, panteras, bulldogs, alces, osos, jabalíes, tejones, tapires, asnos, ardillas y avifauna no especificada. Todo bien hasta el momento y no necesariamente tendría que habérsenos mencionado a cada especie escogida para aquello; pero, en esta oportunidad, solamente son dos las bestias parlantes que concuerdan con las ya mencionadas: los castores y las ardillas, que de seguro son descendientes de los primeros animales bendecidos con dicho don. Los demás animales que se sabe por primera vez que pueden hablar son: los zorros, los lobos y un león. Perfecto, y reitero en que no tendrían por qué haber sido mencionados, ya que no se nos iba a nombrar uno por uno acerca de todos los afortunados. El problema con esto es que Aslan no es el único león en Narnia... Y, al tratarse de una deidad metamorfoseada en este tipo de felino, que como avatar le queda ideal, ya que es acorde a la grandeza y solemnidad que se le quiere dar como personaje, no concuerda con el hecho de que haya más leones parlantes, ya que le restan mística y aura, y hasta se me hace incoherente, porque, de haber habido otro león, eso sí que tendría que haber sido mencionado enEl sobrino del mago; aunque igual esto se deba para reforzar en cierta medida el trato de Aslan con sus congéneres, porque el otro león se siente muy halagado cuando Aslan lo alude diciendo ‘’nosotros los leones’’ o algo así. Pero, en fin, pensaba que Aslan era único en su especie. Parece que la única diferencia física es que Aslan tiene un pelaje con tonalidad dorada.En mi reseña de la precuela, indiqué que el autor aclaró muchas dudas futuras, pero que también dejó otras tantas en el tintero para posteriores entregas. Algunas fueron respondidas en cierta medida, otras pasaron al olvido. En esta oportunidad, me refiero a lo siguiente: información acerca de Lefay o la Atlántida, de las que aparentemente no sabremos más; del linaje de Jadis, ya que se decía que podía tener sangre de gigantes. Y bueno, sabemos que los humanos son descendientes de Adán y Eva, pero ahora se nos revela que Jadis es descendiente de Adán y Lilith, y que algo tiene que ver con los genios. O sea, que, ¿Adán pudo viajar entre mundos? ¿Eso quiere decir que el Jardín del Edén es otro mundo? Me hago esta pregunta ya que Jadis no tiene su origen en la Tierra como los humanos, ella es del mundo de Charn... y la castora da a entender que ella se da el derecho de autoproclamarse reina por fingir ser humana, aunque lo sea a medias; siguiendo con Jadis, el castor insinúa que ella fue verdugo del emperador, y ese dato tan fugaz me parece interesantísimo; y por último, así como ya mencioné anteriormente, parece que los primeros reyes de Narnia y toda su dinastía fueron condenados al olvido, si es que el autor aún no tenía idea de sus existencias y no supo cómo hacerlos encajar en el futuro cuando estaba escribiendo acerca del pasado, considerando que la saga no fue publicada en orden cronológico.Tampoco sé dónde ubicar este otro dato, pero entendí la referencia o cameo de Fresón/Alado; y que aparentemente es la única mención o alusión a algún personaje del libro anterior, aparte de Aslan y la Bruja Blanca.Del mismo modo, hay nuevas interrogantes a futuro, como las siguientes: ¿Quién fue Cair Paravel y qué tiene de especial su castillo?; En dónde están las Islas Solitarias y qué tienen que ver con Jadis; con respecto a ‘’la palabra deplorable’’, que tanto caos causó en elloredel otro libro, aquí se quedó en nada. Esperemos que algo de eso se mencione a futuro; incluso, nos enteramos de que Aslan se encarga de otros mundos, asunto en el que estaría interesante indagar; también sobre el norte de Narnia, en donde está la frontera con los gigantes belicosos (diferentes a los de la raza de Torpón), o esperar que tengan algún rol más importante en otra historia; ¿Qué sucedió con el zorro, las ardillas, sus amigos sátiros y el enano que estaban merendando en el bosque? Ya que Aslan no los liberó de estar convertidos en estatuas; acerca del dicho que reza que ‘’quien es rey o reina en Narnia lo será para siempre’’... a esperar qué sucederá con eso cuando los cuatro hermanos regresen a Narnia; y, por último, más sobre ellorede este mundo en general, como los enanos rojos que se dedican a la minería, etc.En cuanto a los personajes, la única que se me hizo destacable fue la Bruja Blanca. Ella tenía un muy buen rol enEl sobrino del mago, y aquí, aunque su participación es más reducida y/o limitada, no deja de ser un personaje que por lo menos cumple y cae en gracia, a pesar de ser la antagonista. Me encanta que sea sarcástica, déspota y prepotente. Una lástima que ya no se mencione nada acerca de su trasfondo, como su tan potente hechizo de ‘’la palabra deplorable’’, su poder para leer las mentes o su fuerza sobrehumana. En esta ocasión, hasta le pide a Edmund que les ayude a ella y a su enano a mover su trineo fuera de la nieve... La Jadis deEl sobrino del magohabría hecho eso con una sola mano, si es que antes no obligaba al enano y al niño bajo alguna mortal amenaza solo para su disfrute.En cambio, sobre los hermanos, se me hacen demasiado sencillos y simplones (aunque sean niños), a diferencia de Polly y Digory del otro libro, que tampoco es que fueran la gran cosa, pero estaban mejor desarrollados y hasta podrían ser recordables en cierto modo: porque Susan es inexistente en esta historia; Lucy se me hizo algo molesta y fastidiosa como la hermana menor; y a Peter lo encontré demasiado ausente como para aspirar al rol tan sublime de primogénito que se le pretende dar. Al único que destaco de ellos es a Edmund por su desarrollo y evolución, a pesar de que también sea un personaje totalmente olvidable, débil o falto de carisma; pero es el único de los hermanos que está trabajado como tal.Con respecto a Aslan, no es un personaje muy interesante (al menos en esta ocasión), ni mucho menos se hace memorable o entrañable su intervención como sí lo fue enEl sobrino del mago. Allí su participación fue muy similar a como lo adaptaron para la película del 2005; pero aquí se siente un poco genérico y hasta aburrido, aunque no ha dejado de caerme bien, ya que simpatizo con él.Y como ya he mencionado en más de una oportunidad, este es un libro extremadamente básico. Por lo menos se agradece de que avance rápido, no aburra con su lectura y que siempre vaya directo al grano; a pesar de no generar tanto interés como su precuela sí lo hacía. Y a diferencia deEl sobrino del magoque no se me hizo que fuera un libro para niños, sino que disfrutable para todo público, acá sí sentí el toque más infantil.Siendo honesto, esta lectura no me causó nada especial. Creo que conocer tan bien y casi de memoria la historia gracias a la película afectó sobremanera mi experiencia, y más si se trata de una adaptación tan fiel al libro.El final se sientemeh, pero se entiende de que originalmente no fue una obra ideada para tener alguna secuela; además de que aquí se deja en evidencia que el profesor algo sabía sobre Narnia, y que justamente por eso nunca fue incrédulo con Lucy. También siento que es un crimen lo tan exprés que se describe a la ‘’gran’’ batalla final en un par de páginas, sin acción.Sin embargo, es posible decir queEl león, la bruja y el armariosea agradable como libro, a pesar de toda su simpleza, pero no siento que cumpla en un 100% como lectura. Igual, hay que ser sinceros y no es que tenga una trama apoteósica o trepidante, y si bien su precuela tampoco cumplía con esto último a rajatabla, ofrecía una experiencia mucho mejor.De igual forma, este título se siente muy plano y puede que, hasta carente de personalidad, a pesar de su tan simpática trama, la cual como ya he indicado, es presentada de una forma extremadamente básica.En conclusión, éste es un libro flojo o débil dentro de la belleza que puede ostentar en su historia y ambientación. Siento que a regañadientes le otorgaría ★★★☆☆ de calificación, ya que 2.5 estrellas es más concordante con mi rúbrica y criterios personales que empleo a la hora de darle una valoración final a un libro. Pero, a pesar de que la historia es bonita, breve y no aburra, creo que muy acertadamente me decanto por la segunda puntuación.Y seamos realistas, este libro suele liderar el primer lugar de casi todos los tops que hay sobre cuál es la mejor entrega de la saga, pero los únicos argumentos que se usan para justificar esto suelen ser: que fue el primero en ser publicado, que porque es el primer libro de la saga leído por quién organizó elranking, porque es una lectura de su infancia y que evoca su nostalgia, etc. Ningún argumento que realmente sea válido o racional. Todos nublados por sesgos que ni siquiera tienen sentido y que nomás sobrevaloran la obra. Una cosa es que tengas algo favorito, lo cual está bien; y lo otro creer que por eso mismo sea lo mejor. ¿Se imaginan que cualquier saga de películas, videojuegos, libros, alguna serie o banda musical tenga sumagnum opusfundamentado en apelaciones nostálgicas? Descabelladísimo. Pero, bueno, de momento, el mejor representante de la franquicia esEl sobrino del mago, lo cual ya argumenté en su reseña pertinente.Ahora, el siguiente título que cronológicamente corresponde esEl caballo y el muchacho, pero es infame por estar entre las peores entregas, y si aquí no me convencí del todo..., tampoco es que eso sea impedimento para que de igual forma quiera leer su continuación, ya que esta es una saga que me sigue interesando mucho.Pero antes de terminar la reseña, recomiendo encarecidamente a todos quienes estén interesados en este libro y que aún no hayan visto la película, que no la vean y espérense un poco más. Primero lean el libro o podría arruinarles la experiencia; aunque, si están interesados en la saga y deciden ver la película antes, es totalmente válido, porque, al menos en este caso, la película es superior al libro gracias a los pequeños cambios y diferencias que tiene para mejor; además de la tan épica y espectacular batalla final, en conjunto con su maravillososoundtrack. La adaptación del 2005 le hace una justicia y favor abismal al libro y a la vez todo lo contrario, ya que siento que lo opaca en todo sentido.Finalmente, quiero concluir citando a la profecía:«Cuando el hijo de Adán en carne y hueso en el trono de Cair Paravel esté sentado, los malos tiempos habrán acabado». Y, en efecto, aquella profecía se cumplió. Así que, en teoría, ya no debería de haber más malos tiempos en Narnia, porque se han acabado por los siglos de los siglos. Veamos qué sucederá en futuros libros cuando se contradiga esta profecía, al incluir nuevos malos tiempos para otras historias.FRASES Y COMENTARIOS QUE SEAN INTERESANTES PARA DESTACAR:-‘’Nadie puede decir que has robado un abrigo mientras no salga del armario donde lo has encontrado.

Amos & Boris,"Somewhere on the good side of ""meh.""This review was originally published athttp://www.drttmk.com/books/amos-and-....This is an odd story, but I suppose that's to be expected from the author of ""The Amazing Bone"" and ""Sylvester's Magic Pebble."" A mouse named Amos, who lives by the sea, decides to build a boat and go sailing in the ocean. It's unclear where he learns how to build a boat or sail, although he does seem (from the perspective of a layman such as myself) to take important things with him, such as ""wood in case repairs should be necessary"" and ""a needle and thread for the mending of torn sails."" Oddly, he doesn't seem to take any tools for fishing, though you would expect that to be a major source of food on the ocean. Maybe, since he's a mouse, he doesn't expect there to be many fish of the size he can eat. At any rate, he is some kind of natural-born boat-builder and sailor, and instead of practicing sailing near the shore for a while, he just immediately heads off into the middle of the ocean, where he gets so wrapped up in navel-gazing that he falls off the boat and into the ocean, never to see the boat again.Luckily, this happens in the middle of a whale pod, and a whale named Boris comes by the next day and marvels at the unique animal in the middle of the ocean. Upon receiving Amos's explanation of his origins, Boris agrees to carry him home, fascinated to get to know such an unusual creature. It takes them a week to get home, during which Amos learns to eat plankton somehow (maybe since he's a mouse, they're big enough for him to see? But how would he get enough of them to eat?) and apparently only misses ""fresh, unsalty water"" instead of simply dying of thirst. They get to know each other, and Amos, upon reaching his home shore, promises Boris that if he can ever help him with anything, that he will. They part as friends.Years later, Boris is a victim of a Hurricane and, in an unbelievable coincidence, ends up stranded on the exact beach where Amos lives. Amos promptly brings by ""two goodhearted elephants"" who roll Boris back into the ocean. And then they say goodbye again. The end.There's definitely a parallel between this story and the fable of ""The Lion and the Mouse"" or ""Androcles and the Lion"", depending on the version you read, except that the whale apparently is a baleen whale (given the reference to plankton) and never actually endangers Amos's life. The larger animal saves the smaller one, and when the smaller one promises to repay the favor someday, the larger one scoffs. In this case, however, it's more of a good-natured scoffing. Amos doesn't need to promise to help Boris in the future in order to prevent Boris from eating him; he just does, out of the kindness of his heart. Both creatures are very kind-hearted, and their brief acquaintance but lasting friendship shows that they understand this in each other.I'm not really sure what this book is trying to say. It's well-written, but as with the other Steig books I've read, most of what happens doesn't make much sense. How does Amos know how to build, and sail, a boat? Why doesn't he practice first? Why does Steig find it necessary to tell us all of the things that Amos brought with him on the boat if none of them ever get used, and the boat is never seen again? Why the scene, just after Boris rescues Amos, of Boris ""[forgetting] for a moment that he had a passenger on his back and [sounding]"" (i.e. diving), followed by his resurfacing, throwing Amos into the air to painfully hit the water again, at which point Amos, ""Crazy with rage, ... scream[s] and punche[s] at Boris until he remember[s] he owe[s] his life to the whale."" Why doesn't Boris just think to warn Amos ahead of time from the start? How does Amos avoid dying of thirst in his week without fresh water? Also, I take issue with Amos's phrase, ""I'm a mouse, which is a mammal, the highest form of life."" That's not how evolution works. And although it's a cute usage of language to describe Amos's life as ""mousing around"", describing Boris as ""whaling about"" makes it sound like he's killing other whales. That's a word, and it has a meaning. He can't just expect us to forget the meaning it has. Although, technically, ""mousing"" also means killing mice.Also, the phrase ""I don't have to tell you how these old friends felt at meeting again in this desparate situtation."" Okay, technically, Mr. Steig, you don't. But you also didn't have to write this book. You're a writer, for Pete's sake. Write.How come we don't get any explanation of where Amos manages to find elephants? Does Amos live in Africa, and they just happened to be passing by? Is there a nearby zoo that he broke them out of? Is Amos's world just populated by various animals and they're his neighbors? And after the elephants help Amos, does he now owe them a favor as well?Maybe I'm just nitpicking. The book has a good message, decent artwork, and it's well-written. But for me to give a book the best rating, I want to come away going, ""Yes! This is what I want people to read to my kids!"" And I just didn't get that from this book. Sure, it's a decent book, but that just puts it in the company of the vast majority of books that range from mediocre to okay to decent. It's acceptable, but I'm not wowed by it. I'd give it like a 7/10, which in my rating system of bad-meh-good puts it as a ""meh"".Message: Be kind and help others.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/150683.Amos_Boris,Amos & Boris.txt
Duck for President,"A review of: Duck For PresidentPublishing Details: Duck For PresidentAuthor: Doreen CroninYear: 2004Publishing: Simon & SchusterIntroduction: This book continues the story of Farmer Brown and his rebellious farm animals. Duck becomes tired of his endless chores on the farm, so he seeks to overthrow Farmer Brown and run the farm himself. He doesn’t stop there, though, and continues up the political ladder until he realizes that maybe his first job wasn’t so bad after all...Description: Every day, Duck is responsible for mowing the lawn and grinding coffee beans. He quickly grows tired of the mindless chores, and decides to run against Farmer Brown for control of the farm. After the animals register and vote, Duck wins by a landslide. He soon tires of the job and decides to move on to running for governor. He wins the campaign, but the same situation happens all over again and he grows bored with the work. As a result, he decides to run for president. He barely wins and sets to work at his new job. Just as before, he finds the work difficult and loses interest. He sees a want add for a farm duck, and finds himself back on Farmer Brown’s farm. Somehow, he manages to avoid work and starts to write his autobiography.Text Judgment: This animal fantasy story models repetition for students, because Duck goes through the same process of boredom, campaigning, winning, and boredom each time. The pictures are lively and colorful, which is perfect for keeping younger students interested. This could be a good beginning book for learning about the political system of America. The book portrays the campaign process and how candidates move up the political ladder. It also demonstrates America’s commitment to democracy.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/96128.Duck_for_President,Duck for President.txt

For a fuller explanation see my review for101 Amazing Facts about AustraliaYou can see all the books on their ownshelfIt seems unlikely that I will actually achieve 365 reviews of kids books this year, but I don't want to stop.11 April 2021I rather like what I had originally written on this. Now that Offspring are grown and gone to college I really really love running across these little moments I captured back in the day.***16 July 2014An object lesson:Many parents who read aloud to their children may finds themselves one day wondering when, exactly, that fell by the wayside. It can be a gradual thing, having trouble choosing a book everyone wants, finding the time away from homework, and showers, and music practice, and dance classes. But what I learned last night is, it doesn't have to be.There was a new Mo Willems book on display at the library. Of course, I picked it up. Adults and older children who aren't reading Willems are really missing something last observed in Calvin and Hobbes. The art is so simple, so spare, so casual-looking, that it may take you a moment to realize what incredible skill went into drawing so effortlessly perfect characters. There is a pigeon, beady-eyed and aggressive. There is a duckling, with enormous blue eyes and adorable feet. (Go ahead, you try drawing winsome with so few lines and see what monsters you create. I'll wait.....I know, it's hard.)I sat there on the sofa, rooting through my bag of loot from the library trawl, casually stacking everything beside me, face up. The children, loathe to start their going-to-bed rituals, lingered and looked on. And then I just whipped out The Duckling, held it in the traditional story-time open fashion, and started reading. I hadn't left the title page before the PandaBat had jumped in, lending a patented cute-toddler voice to the Duckling.So we read. And we laughed. It wasn't any time at all, less than five minutes, but all three of us were utterly delighted. It was a charming moment, and who doesn't need more of those on school-and-work-nights? Just because my 13 and 10 -year-old kids aren't inclined to be seen checking out picture books themselves, doesn't mean they won't love them.Thus endeth the lesson.Library copy",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11556479-duckling-gets-a-cookie-the-pigeon-series,"Duckling Gets a Cookie!, The-Pigeon series.txt"
Corduroy,"Originally published in 1968, this adorable picture-book was one of the reading staples of my early childhood, so I was simply delighted when it was chosen as one of our December selections, over inThe Picture-Book Clubto which I belong, where our theme for the month is ""toys."" This gave me the opportunity to revisit an old favorite, which I greatly enjoyed! The story of a teddy bear who longs for a home, and the little girl who falls in love with him on first sight,Corduroyfollows its eponymous ursine hero as he sets out, late one night, to find a button to replace the one he had lost, sitting on a department store shelf for so long. Eventually returned to his shelf, still sans button, Corduroy is confronted the following morning with a wonderful surprise...There are so many things I love about this book, that it's difficult to know where to begin! Freeman's artwork is charming, and his story engaging. It taps into some common childhood fantasies, from the idea that toys come alive, when the humans leave the room, to the wish-fulfillment scenario in which one wanders through a normally crowded locale - a store, a museum, a busy street - late at night, free to explore in ways that one usually wouldn't be. Although I can't say I thought about it much as a kid, when I simply took it for granted, as part of the story, I love the fact that Lisa, the little girl who eventually takes Corduroy home, thereby fulfilling all his dreams, is an African-American child. I love that this is a matter-of-fact reality, rather than an important part of the story, as so much of the multicultural literature being produced for children nowadays feels more ""issue"" driven to me. This is just a delightful story about a bear and a girl, in which the girl happens to be black. I can't think of too many vintage children's titles (excepting the work of Ezra Jack Keats) where this is the case.I'm so happy to have reacquainted myself with this beloved title from my childhood - it more than lived up to my memory of it! - which I read and reread as a little girl. I think I will hunt down the sequel,A Pocket for Corduroy, which Ididn'tread as a child, and see if it is just as good...",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/231850.Corduroy,Corduroy.txt
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,"Once upon a time there lived a Golden Age gay icon, who whiled away her pre-waxing years sitting atop a split-rail fence in some dour, nondescript American Midwest landscape. Her dreams of a more outrageously fierce existence in the big city (wearing roller skates and one-foot-diameter afro wigs and dancing toArmy of Loversin between lines of blow) were hemmed in on all sides by rusted farm equipment, NAPA Auto Parts Stores, and a lone, dejected Applebee’s out on the turnpike. Kansas didn’t even have a meth lab yet. Or a Sally Beauty Supply. Her nascent fabulousness was imprisoned by voluminous swaths of gingham, satin ribbons, and fussy lace collars -- none of them, unfortunately, worn ironically, with a lollipop or a pacifier or Harajuku-style -- at the behest of Aunt Em, a woman whose character is explained by the shocking fact that the better part of her non-church wardrobe was purchased at Quality Farm & Fleet. (I know.Couldn’t you just die?)This girl, as yet scarcely old enough to have a couple of cherries or a leaping dolphin tattooed near her cameltoe, was named Dorothy. One day, like so many dreamy-eyed girls, she donned her Skechers and her discount department store jeans and waited for a meteorological disaster to rescue her from her sad, glitterless rural life.As luck would have it, one day, an especially violent cyclone (rated EF4 by the local weather service) carved a bloody path of destruction, misery, and death through central Kansas, carrying Dorothy’s trailer (with her and her dog Toto inside, watchingJudge Judy) high into the troposphere. At first, Dorothy mistook the rhythmic vibrations for a circuit party and looked under the bed for her whistle, but soon enough she realized she was airborne. And it feltFab. U. Lous.She thought she even spotted a cross-country Virgin America flight with Diana Ross sitting in first class refusing a skunky glass of Chardonnay and calling the stewardess an uppity white bitch. (She’ll have Dershowitz on the phone when she gets to LAX.) But maybe Dorothy was unconscious and imagining it all. At any rate, she was immune to the ghastly, soul-rending shrieks, rising from below, of a Kansas mother cradling her dead baby who was impaled by a windswept awl in the cyclone. She was busy listening to “Yahoo!” by Erasure on her iPod.Eventually, after floating around earth’s gaseous atmosphere for a couple of hours, dreaming of Barney’s Co-op Sale, Dorothy landed in some unknown land, flat-ironed her hair, and repositioned her training thong. Outside her trailer a bunch of ghetto midgets were milling around with some old witchy broad. No, it wasn’t that überfem Glinda – like in the movie – it was some tired-ass old mannish thing, looking likeLinda HuntinThe Year of Living Dangerously. Basically, this bitch is no help at all. She’s supposedly a witch, and you’d think she’d know the way to the Meatpacking District, but all she does is give her some cheap-ass silver shoes (Steve Madden – yuck) and kiss Dorothy on the forehead leaving this “magical” lipmark. Dorothy suspects it’s herpes simplex one and hightails it outta there before the witch gives her boxed wine and has her pose for “art” photographs. (Yes, I remember thevery special episodeofDiff’rent Strokeswith Gordon Jump very well, thank you very much.)Okay, you know the rest of the story (for the most part). Dorothy seeks out the Wizard of Oz by mapquesting Emerald City (or, alternately, the City of Emeralds) and on the way she meets a Scarecrow, a Tin Woodman, and a Lion, who are all needy and want to bask in the glow of her super-hot blinding aura and fierce fantabulousness (and bum a few amphetamines). The Wizard, who likes to mix up his corporeal manifestations, appears to them in his Emerald City throne room (Picture Antwan “Big Boi” Patton’s house onCribsbut with fewer stripper poles and lots more green marble ) in the forms of a giant Little Richard-sized head, a Sears catalog swimsuit model, a vaguely menacing monster, and a talking ball of fire. Obviously, the Wizard has been to see Cirque de Soleil and knows the power of a little Québécois razzle-dazzle. Whilst filing his nails and reading the latest issue ofInterviewwith Drew Barrymore on the cover, the Wizard tells his motley supplicants that, yeah, yeah, sure, he will grant their stupid, retarded wishes if they murder the Wicked Witch of the West, a Tribeca scenester who is always bogarting Page Six with her leather-daddy winged monkey warehouse parties. Dorothy & Crew reluctantly agree – an act of volition which effectively makes Dorothy the youngest hit girl in the history of YA literature, and the only one to ever wear lace-trimmed socklets. Eventually, during a wet t-shirt contest, the witch melts and Dorothy, still flush with her first taste of killing… sweet killing, returns with her entourage to the Wizard to claim her payoff. But then, gosh golly, gee whiz… in a startling atheistic allegory, the all-powerful Wizard is revealed to be an impotent little Wallace Shawn-type standing behind a screen fiddling with some sound board knobs. Nietzsche couldn’t’ve said it any better. The Wizard, who realizes he’s dealing with a bunch of saps here, pretends to grant everyone’s wishes (except Dorothy’s – cuz he’s totally jealous of her fabulousness) and they actually fall for it. Dorothy, burnt-out on the Emerald City scene and suffering from dehydration and exhaustion, longs to return to Kansas to start her autobiographical blog. A bunch of stupid stuff happens, some of which involve a hot air balloon and bitch-slapping trees, and the quartet make their way to Glinda, the Witch of the South, to see if she can grant Dorothy’s wish and thereby prove that she’s at least somewhat less worthless than everybody else in OzOn the way to the Glinda’s ‘hood, the posse comes across a village where all the people are made of china and break easily (Gee, I wonder why they leftthatgreat episode out of the film), and after the Lion accidentally destroys one of their china churches with his tail (I’m not kidding), giving impetus to hate crime legislation the world over, the Tin Woodman decapitates some wolves with his ax. Dorothy skips and frolics through the gory pools of matted fur, blood, and steaming viscera and asks Glinda, who appears to be on Quaaludes, for a trip home. Glinda, as useless as every other allegedly magical person in Oz, tells her that the cheap-ass Steve Madden shoes she’s been wearing could’ve gotten her back to Kansas all along. (And, by the way, when she returns to the Sticks, she should really take off those Chinese panda-skin leatherette things. They’ll give her fatal foot rash.)So Dorothy uses the magic of those shoes made in China under the brand name of a man imprisoned for magical tax evasion to return to Kansas, where her Aunt and Uncle have long since forgotten about her and adopted a more attractive, Latvian girl who’s not too prissy to hand-inseminate the cows. Dorothy overdoses one night in a dilapidated feed barn on a potent mixture of Robitussin and Gas-X, and Judy Davis plays her in a television movie that no one remembers long enough to have forgotten.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/236093.The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.txt
The Wonky Donkey,"Looking for a book that'll instill a lifelong phobia about birds in your child? Then look no further thanThe Wonkey Donkey, which somehow manages to make fun of amputees, the visually impaired, and those with gastrointestinal disorders, all while offering up questionable word definitions and making fart jokes. Oh, and showing a bird plucking the donkey's eye out on the third spread. (Completely unnecessary. The first time we see the donkey, we only see him in profile. So he could've only had one eye; there's no reason we had to see the bird carrying the eyeball away!)I just couldn't get past that part. I mean, I read the rest of the book, but I was distracted, thinking about how little kids could potentially develop a debilitating fear about birds swooping down and plucking out their eyes. The rest of the book did little to redeem itself. It offered up stupid, nonsensical definitions of words like ""hanky-panky"" and ""spunky"". The former is often used in a sexual context today, so I thought that was a bit weird. But ""spunky"" waswayoff; the book tells us that it means ""quite good looking"". Any dictionary I've ever seen defines that word quite differently.The illustrations aren't terrible, style-wise. But I really question the wisdom of that one picture. In trying to be funny, the illustrator may have inadvertently caused a whole bunch of children to need therapy.I don't get what all the fuss is about. Maybe it works as a song, but as a picture book, it really falls short.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7699554-the-wonky-donkey,The Wonky Donkey.txt
Owl Babies,"Owl babies is a story about 3 baby owls, Sarah, Percy and Bill. The three baby owl live with their mother in the hole of a tree. One day Sarah, Percy and Bill wake up and their mother is gone. She is nowhere to be seen. The owl babies start wondering where their mother has gone. The babies miss their mother very much, especially Bill. There is a memorable sentence said by Bill in the book ‘Where is my mummy?’ young children can relate to Bill’s anxiousness. Mother owl finally appears at the end of the story and she says to them they should know that she will always come back. This is a lovely story and can be used to help in transition when young children start nursery or school. The illustration in the book are very nice and Bills memorable sentence can encourage young children in joining in when reading the book to a child or group of children. This can be used in the early years foundation stage as the book of the week especially in the first week when children feel the separation from their parents and to ease their separation.My favourite character was Sarah as the eldest she made her siblings feel safe. ‘I think we should all sit on my branch.’ Sarah said. The owl babies sat on one branch so they will not be scared and feel safe. This book is suitable for 3-7 year of age. The book has sad moments, and happy moments that we can all relate to. It encourage us to think and this book can help children to think what they would do in Sarah, Percy and Bills situation. This book can be used for curriculum support especially PHSE (personal, social and health education).",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/716944.Owl_Babies,Owl Babies.txt
This Is Not My Hat,"Please note that even though I do indeed both realise and understand that Jon Klassen'sThis is Not My Hatwon the 2013 Caldecott Medal, I personally have really not enjoyed either the text or the accompanying illustrations (and I am actually not even managing to be able to appreciate them all that much on some academic, esoteric level).Now while some (and perhaps even a great many) readers might well and even strongly disagree with this, with my very much and intensely negative reaction to and assessment ofThis is Not My Hatby claiming that it is supposed to be a darkly if not even somewhat creepily humorous story (with supposedly an important cautionary message against stealing), I for one and on an entirely emotional level do not really consider any part of the narrative, of Jon Klassen's featured text, as even remotely funny and laughter inducing, but rather pretty cringeworthy and even potentially worrisome (and really with no or at the very least only very minutely redeeming positive messages).For honestly, what kind of internal or even external messages are supposedly being presented by and with the ambiguous ending ofThis is Not My Hat, where the bigger fish has clearly gotten his stolen hat back but we are certainly left to wonder what has transpired, we are left to strongly consider if not actually believe that the smaller fish, the culprit, the hat nabber might well have been gobbled up, might well have been destroyed by the larger fish for his behaviour, for his act of petty thievery? That ANY kind of criminal activity, even something as minor as stealing a small and insignificant hat warrants destruction? That thieves, that robbers somehow deserve death? And yes, I certainly did in fact and still do consider the latter as the most likely outcome ofThis is Not My Hat, that the small fish has most probably been killed and gobbled up by the larger fish.And although a sizeable majority of the reviews ofThis is Not My HatI have read so far also rather do seem to indicate that the ambiguous ending, that the possibility of the smaller fish having been caught and perhaps even killed by the larger fish for stealing the latter's hat implies a strong and important message of caution against stealing, I am sorry, but for me, the main point made inThis is Not My Hatseems to be that while stealing the hat was indeed a silly, foolish and stupid, a dangerous thing for the small fish to do (mainly because the other fish is so much bigger and stronger than the smaller one), it does not every really also come across in any manner that stealing the hat in the first place was wrong from a philosophical and ethical point of departure, that stealing is morally wrong, period (for the author's, for Jon Klassen's presented narrative certainly does seem to rather sport a somewhat supportive attitude towards the little fish and his many excuses as to why he has decided to steal that hat, as these excuses are also never really in any way refuted or condemned, at least not to any length).While I guess parents, teachers, etc. might indeed consider usingThis is Not My Hatfor discussion and debating purposes (especially with and for slightly older children), the very large font size of the written, of the printed text and the generally simple sentence structure ofThis is Not My Hatindicates in my opinion pretty strongly that Jon Klassen has most definitely intended this book as mainly for younger children (from about the ages of three to six or so). And for the intended age group (for younger children), the presented narrative ofThis is Not My Hatand what it might imply, as well as the ambiguous, open, and yes potentially frightening ending, all this is in fact, or at least could be a bit too heavy-duty, a bit too difficult and problematic, with many possibly uncomfortable questions that could well and easily arise.And finally, I guess if I had actually enjoyed Jon Klassen's accompanying illustrations a bit more than I did, I probably would also have liked or at least been able to appreciate the end product, the combination of text and image that isThis is Not My Hata trifle more (probably not in any way enough for three stars, but definitely sufficient for two to two and a half stars). For yes, and their Caldecott Medal award quite notwithstanding, I really have not at all liked Jon Klassen's illustrations, I have not enjoyed the artwork featured inThis is Not My Hat(as aesthetically, I have found both the colour schemes used and the resulting pictorial images stagnant, emotionless, and flat, and not at all to my personal tastes). And while I have indeed to a certain point at least mildly appreciated the visual depictions of the masses of seaweeds at the end ofThis is Not My Hat, that is, I am sorry to say, simply not nearly enough for me.Now perhaps I am in fact missing something, and perhaps I am also being rather too majorly curmudgeonly and hyper-critical here, but truly, the combination of text and image inThis is Not My Hatreally does not at all work for me, leaving me absolutely cold, unsatisfied and uncomfortable, and as a result thereof, also not really all that keen on trying more of Jon Klassen's picture book offerings in the future (as I somehow do doubt that we are a good fit, especially with regard to his artwork).",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13531024-this-is-not-my-hat,This Is Not My Hat.txt
Pete the Cat and His Four Groovy Buttons,"I love Pete! I got this one for my grandson, who is 5. I have bought him a few Pete the Cat books so it took me until the second one to realize that he sings a song in every book. You can go to the publishers website (Harper Collins) or You Tube to pull up the songs being sung by the author which helps to know the actual tune. Otherwise you’re scrambling to come up with one of your own. Which is fine, kiddos don’t care, but I liked the actual song much better than my own.Anyway, what I love about the Pete books:in each one, Pete has a problem, but instead of getting all unraveled over the problem, he just takes it in stride and sings a song. As an adult, I NEED TO FOLLOW PETE’S ADVICE, because I get too spun up over little things. Pete is carefree and fun.I appreciated how the books repeat lines so towards the end, my grandson was saying the lines with me.The illustrations were whimsical, colorful and very appealing to children and adults alike.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12875557-pete-the-cat-and-his-four-groovy-buttons,Pete the Cat and His Four Groovy Buttons.txt
Stellaluna,"I first saw this book on an episode of “Reading Rainbow” (my favorite TV series when I was little!) and I instantly fell in love with this book! “Stellaluna” is a gorgeous picture book by Janell Cannon and it is about how a baby bat named Stellaluna learns how to live with the birds after she is separated by her mother during an owl attack. “Stellaluna” is truly one of the best books for bat lovers everywhere!Once there lived a mother fruit bat that gave birth to a baby bat named Stellaluna and one night, Mother Bat was carrying Stellaluna while searching for some ripe fruit to eat. Suddenly, an owl spots the bats and tries to catch them and Stellaluna ended up falling out of her mother’s pouch and ended up falling on a tree branch and then eventually falls into a bird’s nest. For awhile, Stellaluna had been living with the birds and learning their ways and started acting like a true bird, even learning how to fly!Excellent! This book is simply truly excellent! Janell Cannon has certainly done an excellent job at both illustrating and writing this book. Janell Cannon makes the story extremely exciting and heartwarming as it details the adventures that Stellaluna embarks on after she is separated from her mother and lives with the birds. I loved the way that Stellaluna maintains a strong relationship with the birds even though she is a bat, which proves that no matter how different you are, you are still a special person on the inside. I also thought that it was really cute to see Stellaluna acting like a bird as she provides so much humor for the book by trying to act like a bird in a bat body. Janell Cannon also did a great job at providing tension in this book, especially when Stellaluna is separated from her mother and many children will definitely feel afraid for Stellaluna as the idea of losing one’s parent is frightening to a child. Janell Cannon’s illustrations are simply gorgeous and realistic, especially of the images of Stellaluna herself as she has huge brown eyes and has golden fur all over her body which makes her look beautiful and cute at the same time! I also loved the images of Stellaluna flying through the sky as she is the one character who stands out during the night sky as she seems to glow in the blue night sky while she is flying in the air.All in all, “Stellaluna” is an instant treat of a baby bat’s amazing tale that you just cannot resist to read to your children! For anyone who love reading books about bats and the importance of a true family, this is definitely a book that I would highly recommend to children ages four and up.Review is also on:Rabbit Ears Book Blog",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/786256.Stellaluna,Stellaluna.txt
The Polar Express,"Circa the year 2001, my young 8-year-old self strolled into the tiny, yet cozy, school library alongside other fellow 3rd graders, all decked out in our matching Catholic school uniforms. Upon tiptoeing and reaching into the shelf for a new book to read, there stood out a rather tall and thin hardcover, among the dozens of rather small bundles of literature. Chris Van Allsburg’s “The Polar Express” and its title above his wonderfully painted titular steamroller glimmered in front of me. Was it during the Christmas season, on the road towards our anticipated wintry break that my senses tingled upon this discovery? My mind seems to forget. But knowing myself, among hundreds of movies, television shows, and books that increased love and eagerness, the innocent kid in me, from the ages of 1 to… well even now, was obsessed with two things: trains and Christmas.My little school being stationed right next to the railroad tracks, my eyes always wandered off in Kindergarten class towards the windows as Santa Fe’s whistle blew through the green shrubbery. Christmas, of course undeniably being the mystical reality of Christ’s birth, was also for me a time of anticipating, come Christmas Eve, as put on the jacket sleeve of this marvelously worded and painted wonder, “the sweet sound of a reindeer’s bell.”And that mystery, that anticipation, and uncovered innocence is something my adult self misses. How lost in pure escape I was upon reading Allsburg’s words, when the gargantuan steamroller pulls up to the young boy’s house to take him on an adventure overnight, and right onto the North Pole’s grounds. Alongside other kids, full of anticipation and unbridled purity not at all erased from their bright eyes, could we as adults return to this state of saccharine, gingerbread, and warm cocoa-by-the-fire love, adjacent to a window pane with snow outlining its virile corners? Allsburg’s simple words which keep mysteries as they are, and yet infuse readers with the utmost imaginative thoughts are a prime example of “less is more.” Second to such is his gentle painterly style, establishing a welcoming air of breathable bewilderment where even the child within the adult can return for just a brief moment.As the years pass, Christmas Day only ever becomes a bit bittersweet, enjoying more so the season when everyone is merry — some in the anticipation of Christ’s birth and others merely trying to “get through the holidays” amidst all the shopping for family and friends, and painstakingly finding the time to be together. But why has it become bittersweet for me? It’s really the fact that knowing Christmas Day marks the end of the joyous season for many, while I and others try to keep the celebration going even past what marks the end of celebration for the general public. Santa Claus once existed for me as a kid, as he did for many. In fact, I was innocently taught he was Jesus’ friend and a saint, who helped Him keep the bright ebullience and purity progressing in the hearts of children and adults. Good ol’ St. Nick. But as the years have passed, of course, the season matures within my heart. And really the meaning of Christmas has only grown to become a bell that must keep ringing through all the trials and tribulations, and God Willing… has evolved into an unopened gift I’m aching to share with a family of my own so they can unwrap it themselves with the same bright-eyed purity and merriment that my young self and as the kids of this story had brimming in their hearts. Someday, Lord. Someday.“At one time most of my friends could hear the bell, but as years passed, it fell silent for all of them. Even Sarah found one Christmas that she could no longer hear its sweet sound. Though I’ve grown old, the bell still rings for me as it does for all who truly believe.”",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/420282.The_Polar_Express,The Polar Express.txt
Matilda,"(A-) 82%| Very GoodNotes:On loving books, kinetic looks, being self-reliant, brains-over-brawn, small but no pawn, its heroine's mentally giant.*Check out progress updates for detailed commentary:Progress updates:01/25/2025- Preamble(1) There are two versions of this eBook at my library, and as much as I detest the big Netflix logo defacing the cover, this is the original text, not the 2022 altered text that removes ""offensive"" language.- Regardless of how you feel about the controversy, this is the version written by no one else but Roald Dahl, and so this is the only version I will ever read.01/29/2025- Chapters 1–5(1) First of all, this has a ton of illustrations! At least compared to ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" which I recently finished.- Probably because illustrations for the latter were done retroactively, and along with other books for visually-uniform new editions, so far less time would have been put into that compared to a new release.- I don't think Quentin Blake started illustrating Dahl books until the late 1970s.(2) ""[Her] parents looked upon Matilda in particular as nothing more than a scab. A scab is something you have to put up with until the time comes when you can pick it off and flick it away.""- This story definitely has a juvenile tone, which makes sense coming from a four year-old's perspective.- Not necessarily potty humor, but more lowbrow in a Dav Pilkey sort of way.- There's also talk of bunions and nose-picking shortly thereafter.(3) As with ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" the correct and regular use of ""nor"" pleases me to no end.(4) This is a very quaint-feeling book, at least to start. Before all the hijinks begin, it's all about Matilda's reading routine, which no doubt strikes a chord with its likely book-inclined readership.- Not only are specific authors and names of books mentioned, it includes quite a long library book reading list, which I'm sure has been the focus of many a book club or reading challenge.- It also goes into a fair bit of detail explaining libraries and how to use them.- Television, on the other hand, is demonized as a kind of forced activity by her cruel and boorish parents.(5) The language here is very distinctly British English. Much more so than ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" which was regionally ambiguous albeit still linguistically British.- I don't know if Aylesbury is a real place, but the name just screams rural England.- Pounds and pence are also explicitly mentioned, whereas ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" notably used dollars and cents.(6) ""[Matilda] was not quite tall enough to reach things around the kitchen, but she kept a small box in the outhouse which she brought in and stood on in order to get whatever she wanted.""- I can only presume the box serves the same purpose in the outhouse as it does in the kitchen.- The outhouse, along with a nearby sawmill, just underscores this as a distinctly rural setting.(7) ""'No one ever got rich being honest,' the father said. 'Customers are there to be diddled.'""- Yeah, I can only assume, this being a children's book, that ""diddled"" was far less perverse a term when this was written than it is nowadays.- Alternatively, ""diddled"" could be less severe a term in Britain than in North America. The dictionary does describe it as ""chiefly British.""(8) I've noticed that Dahl really likes to hyperbolize and reiterate character traits.- The father here is an immoral and dishonest man, which is hammered home almost ad nauseam. We're made to believe he has no positive characteristics. That he destroys a library book, especially to the reading audience, is treated as sacrilege and irredeemable.- Matilda, on the other hand, is all respect, patience and quiet pastimes. Her diminutive stature is brought up repeatedly and only underscores her total helplessness and thereby justifies her subsequent mischief.(9) ""'Filth,' Mr. Wormwood said. 'If it's by an American it's certain to be filth. That's all they write about.'""- All I'll say is that ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" and its sequels were written by a Brit.01/31/2025- Chapters 6–10(1) While this hasn't yet shown any inkling of fantasy nor the supernatural, it's nonetheless imbued with a great sense of improbability and wonder.- Matilda being able to read and do advanced mathematics in her head is treated like having magical powers.(2) This also uses a lot of Biblical language, which only adds to its sense of mystery.- Hortensia: ""Weare the crusaders ... and the Trunchbull is the Prince of Darkness, the Foul Serpent, the Fiery Dragon...""- It's interesting how Miss Trunchbull isn't only described as akin to (or literally) Satan, but in masculine terms as well: ""the Trunchbull"" not Miss Trunchbull, and ""the Prince"" not princess or anything close to feminine.- Additionally, we have the children attending prayers and scripture lessons, and allusions/references to Moses parting the Red Sea and ""the Day of Judgment.""(3) ""'Get me a mirror!' the father yelled. 'Don't just stand there shrieking at me! Get me a mirror!'""- Reminds me of that scene inBatman1989 after the Joker has his reconstructive surgery. Though, I doubt either could have been inspiration for the other since they came out about the same time.- I presume it's the mother shrieking here, though I can't entirely discount the brother Michael.(4) ""'Be careful!' shrieked the mother. 'Now look what you've done! That's my best Elizabeth Arden face powder!'""- Gee, you know, I'll never see the words ""Elizabeth Arden"" again without Prince Harry coming to mind. That brand's ruined forever!- An awful lot of shrieking in this household. The word's used four times in Chapter 6 alone. Though, it may just be a character trait of the mother.(5) ""[Miss Honey's] body was so slim and fragile one got the feeling that if she fell over she would smash into a thousand pieces, like a porcelain figure.""- Like how Matilda's repeatedly described as being tiny, Miss Honey is also described in diminutive terms and therefore immediately sympathetic—incapable of being a physical aggressor.- Miss Trunchbull is described as the mirror opposite: ""She was a gigantic holy terror, a fierce tyrannical monster who frightened the life out of the pupils and teachers alike.""- Just from these opening descriptions alone, it's crystal clear how we're supposed to feel about these two teachers.(6) ""Looking at [Miss Trunchbull], you got the feeling that this was someone who could bend iron bars and tear telephone directories in half.""- I have a feeling that in the future ""telephone directories"" may require a footnote.- If not Gen-Z, subsequent generations simply won't have a clue—probably about either word. Roald Dahl may as well be Shakespeare.(7) Miss Trunchbull wears ""bottle-green"" breeches, which, if memory serves me right, is exactly what Willy Wonka is described as wearing.- Were bottle-green pants a thing back in the day? If not, I can only conclude that it's intentional as either something Dahl-specific or (albeit far less likely) a direct allusion toCharlie and the Chocolate Factory.(8) Mrs. Wormwood: ""A girl should think about making herself look attractive so she can get a good husband later on. Looks is more important than books, Miss Hunky.""- How veryGame of Thrones, a positively medieval mindset.- Everything about that last sentence, from the message to using the incorrect copular verb to calling Miss Honey by the wrong name just screams superficial, crass and uneducated.- Additionally, Mr. Wormwood calls Miss Honey ""Miss Hawkes"" and ""Miss Harris,"" which is very Horace Slughorn of him/them.- From Miss Trunchbull to Matilda's parents, this book's villains don't care about education, particularly reading.(9) We get blatant child abuse here, with Miss Trunchbull literally throwing kids around by the hair.- A scene that likely horrifies children and parents alike.- It's yet another example of the book's ""brains versus brawn"" duality.(10) ""Mr. Wormwood ... [cast] a look of such simpering sloppiness at his wife it would have made a cat sick.""- I've got to disagree with Dahl's characterization here. There's nothing wrong with going gaga over one's own wife.- Dahl makes it seem like Mr. Wormwood is crazy or delusional for thinking his wife is better looking than Miss Honey. Misogynist though he may be, at least he's a monogamy-minded misogynist.- One man's simp is another man's hopeless romantic.02/05/2025- Chapters 11–16(1) Matilda develops magic/telekinetic powers quite late in the book.- It's interesting how Dahl held onto this as a kind of end reveal, tying her mental magic to her overall mental acumen. It implies that her advanced reading and math abilities were superpowers all along.- Not exactly Harry Potter, though it does involve lightning imagery.(2) Miss Trunchbull: ""As for the cake, it was my own private stock! ... You don't think for one minute I'm going to eat the filth I give to you? That cake was made from real butter and real cream!""- Huh, I can think of plenty butter substitutes, but what ""filth"" would stand in for cream? I don't know that soy or almond milk would have the same baking properties, and may actually be a good deal more costly. Possibly just water.- Frankly, I'm shocked the school serves the students cake at all, albeit substandard. I mean, I never got cake with my school meals.(3) Bruce Bogtrotter is described as: ""An eleven-year-old boy who was decidedly large and round...""- Well, if that didn't create an explicit mental image, the ""trotter"" in his name outright suggests he's pig-like.- I think that's the much more likely implication of the name, at least relative to the somewhat oxymoronic alternative of a person (somehow) trotting in a bog.(4) ""The Trunchbull paused to wipe a fleck of froth from her lips.""- We get a lot of humans being compared to animals in this book. In addition to Miss Trunchbull looking positively rabid here, she has ""bull"" in her name.- Notably, or perhaps haphazardly, Dahl describes her as a ""her"" this time. She's usually denied any feminine descriptors or attributes.(5) ""The only thing [Bruce Bogtrotter] knew for certain was that the law forbade the Trunchbull to hit him with the riding-crop...""- Wait, so throwing girls around by the hair isn't against the law?(6) ""The boy was by now so full of cake he was like a sackful of wet cement and you couldn't have hurt him with a sledge-hammer.""- Fun story, last time I went back to the Philippines I was allowed to pet Prony, the world's largest python. It felt like a sack full of Jell-O. So, while such squishy or gelatinous physiologies do exist in nature, I doubt it applies to humans.- I mean, cake doesn't exactly pad or thicken your skull... though it might possibly dull some pain receptors.(7) Miss Trunchbull to Matilda: ""I shall make absolutely sure you are sent to a reformatory for delinquent girls for the minimum of forty years!""- Possible, though at that point you'd really be stretching the definition of ""girls.""(8) ""'You have put a... a... a crocodile in my drinking water!' the Trunchbull yelled back. 'There is no worse crime in the world against a Headmistress!'""- Aside from direct physical assault, perhaps so. Touché.(9) We get more Biblical allusions, references to the miracles of Jesus and also the first day of Creation.- I know I shouldn't be too shocked, but you just don't see this sort of open Bible talk in today's secular literature, let alone treating it as gospel truth.(10) Re: Miss Honey: ""These were wise words from a wise old bird, but Matilda was too steamed up to see it that way.""- ""Old bird""? she's in her early twenties... which I suppose is quite old from a child's point of view.(11) ""Margarine, Matilda thought. [Miss Honey] really must be poor.""- It's interesting how it's not the dilapidated shack, nor the lack of any furniture or major appliances, nor Miss Honey having to bathe from a bucket, but having to settle for margarine instead of butter that brings it all home that Miss Honey is poor.- It's actually a really poignant moment where, Matilda realizes that Miss Honey lives all alone in a run-down shack without running water, and how much more comfortable and objectively better off her own life is... specific family members notwithstanding.- I don't know, I'm kind of disappointed Miss Honey's choice of bread spread isn't honey.*character limitClick here for the rest",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39988.Matilda,Matilda.txt
Mother Bruce,"Bruce is a bear who likes very little in life. But he loves eggs. He finds complicated recipes on the internet that he tries out. When he discovers a recipe for goose eggs, he immediately heads into the forest to source the items. Back home, he puts the eggs in water but then has to run out for firewood. Returning home, he finds that the eggs have hatched into four goslings. He considers eating them with butter, but loses his appetite. He tries to return them, but Mother Goose has left for the winter. So he is stuck with the four little goslings who follow him everywhere. He tries to make the best of it, but it’s very challenging for one grumpy bear to suddenly be a mother to four little birds.Higgins has created a laugh-out-loud funny picture book about a bear who finds himself unable to say no to parenting four goslings. The humor is wonderfully silly, from the way that Bruce “shops” and “locally sources” his ingredients in the forest to the attempts to get the geese to migrate south. The book shows that this grumpy bear has a heart of gold as he cares deeply for the geese and allows his entire life to be changed by them without getting overly mushy at all. The ending too was a surprise, one that fits perfectly but I didn’t expect at all.A lot of the humor of this picture book is carried in its illustrations which have a real attitude of their own and a point of view. Readers will fall for Bruce despite his grumpiness thanks to the illustrations alone. The little goslings too are a delight as they imitate Bruce, drape themselves around, and explore the world. The illustrations of the goslings as teens is perfection.Funny, perfect to read aloud, and a surprise of an autumnal read, this picture book is great fun. Appropriate for ages 3-5.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25745002-mother-bruce,Mother Bruce.txt
"Help Me, Mr. Mutt!: Expert Answers for Dogs with People Problems","Help Me, Mr. Mutt! is a must read for dog lovers (and cat lovers too). It's a hilarious book that kids and adults will want to read over and over again. The full title is: Help Me, Mr. Mutt!: Expert Answers for Dogs with People Problems and it's by the indomitable sister-team of Janet Stevens and Susan Stevens Crummel.Mr. Mutt is the Dear Abby to the dog world. He is there to offer his sage advice to dogs everywhere. The book is written in a letter format. Dogs write Mr. Mutt with their problem(s), and he writes back with his answer(s). There are a lot of digs at cats, and The Queen (who happens to share an office with Mr. Mutt) has the final say in her letters back to Mr. Mutt, on pink stationery.Here's a sample:""Dear Mr. Mutt,I'm a barker. Hear me bark!Doorbell. BARK!Mailman. BARK!Thunder. BARK!Telephone. BARK!My people yell, ""Don't Bark!""Then they tell me, ""Do a trick! Speak! Speak!For a treat! Doesn't speak mean bark?What do I do? To bark or not to bark?That is the question.Help me, Mr. Mutt!-Confused in ConnecticutP.S. The loudmouth cat gets to meow constantly. Why isn't THAT a problem?""Mr. Mutt writes back in full agreement with ""Confused"" pointing out that it's the way we communicate. Would people tell a duck not to quack? A cow not to moo?He continues on by explaining that it's a brain thing. The dog brain is enormous. The people brain is the size of a pea (there are illustrations to prove it). People are just confused. He then advises the letter writer to have some fun with his/her people. The next time they ask Confused in Connecticut to ""Speak!"" look them in the eye and let out a big Moooo. They'll be so surprised, they'll drop the bag of treats (it's all yours).The Queen responds to Confused in Connecticut by pointing out ""A meow is like music to the ears. A lullaby. A symphony.""See, it's funny! Other ""problems"" that the dogs write about include being put on diets of dry kibble while the cat gets moist food out of the can, being dressed up for holiday pictures (and the cat is never dressed up) and being given too many baths (and of course, no one would dare give the cat a bath).It's witty and there's also a grain of truth to each and every one of the dog's laments. I have two much-loved dogs and both of them could have written a letter to Mr. Mutt. The illustrations are fun and quite realistic. You will recognize these dogs.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2435377.Help_Me_Mr_Mutt_,"Help Me, Mr. Mutt! Expert Answers for Dogs with People Problems.txt"
Creepy Carrots!,"A children's librarian is half media specialist, half psychic. It isn't enough to have to know the books in your collection. You have to know what that pint-sized patron standing before you REALLY wants when they say they want ""a scary book"". For a while there I had this very persistent three-year-old who would beg me for scary fare and wait as I dutifully pulled picture book after picture book for him. After a while I'd begin to wonder what would happen if I actually gave him what he said he wanted. What if I'd handed him Alan Schwartz'sScary Stories to Tell in the Dark)? Would it have scarred him for life? Fortunately the shelves of your average children's room abound with titles that are ""scary"" enough for a small fry. The trick is to find something that manages to balance the funny and the frightening in equal measures, never overplaying its hand. HadCreepy Carrots!by Aaron Reynolds been available when I met that kid, it would have been the first thing I'd have pulled from the shelf. With pitch perfect illustration by the increasingly talented Peter Brown, this beautifully shaded creation is a great example of how to get the tone of a picture book exactly right. Strange and wonderful and weird in all the right places.Jasper Rabbit. You average everyday hare. Jasper has a penchant for carrots. Stands to reason. He's a rabbit. Every day he plucks them from the Crackenhopper Field. Never has a care in the world either. But one day Jasper has a suspicion. Carrots in his tummy he understands, but carrots in his bathtub? In his bedroom? In the tool shed? Seems that Jasper is being stalked by vegetation. Without realizing it, Jasper Rabbit is crossed out of his everyday existence and into . . . the carrot zone.Before we get into anything else, let's talk text. As difficult as it may be, I tried reading this book without paying attention to the accompanying illustrations (no small feat) to get a sense of what author Aaron Reynolds is doing here. What I discovered when I went through it on a word alone basis was that Reynolds has penned a really good readaloud. There's a great inherent drama to lines like, ""Jasper was about to help himself to a victory snack.. when he heard it. The soft... sinister.. tunktunktunk of carrots creeping. He turned... but there was nothing there."" This passage is just begging to be read aloud with Vincent Price-esque cadences. The inherent ridiculousness of creeping carrots being scary is paired with the rather effective ""tunktunktunk"" sound. It reminded me of the sound of the dead son in that old short storyThe Monkey's Paw. It speaks of unnatural slowness, always creepy to kids who move at lightning speeds themselves. Reading this book you hit that dichotomy of potentially frightening and potentially funny over and over until, at last, you reach the end. The book's finale is one of those twist endings that some kids will get while others just enjoy the visuals. I love a picture book with a good twist, and so do child audiences. Particularly when they don't see where the story is going.It's interesting that though Reynolds has specialized in child lit noir for years (hisJoey Fly Private Eyecomic books practically typify the genre) there's nothing ostensibly noir-ish about the text forCreepy Carrots!Just the same, Peter Brown saw something atmospheric there to be plundered. The decision was the right one and Brown cleverly culled from not a single noir source but from many. There are hints of Hitchcock, Wells, Twilight Zone, and other influences (Vertigobeing the most direct reference of them all). The result is a picture of psychosis running rampant. Kids are naturally afraid that there might be monsters under their beds, so they understand paranoia. Only a few books think to take advantage of that fact. Meet one of the few.Atmospheric black and white, when done right, yields picture book gold. Think about the Caldecott Honor winnerThe Spider and the Flyas illustrated in a 1920s movie house style by Tony DiTerlizzi. Brown's work isn't wholly black and white, of course. He allows himself a single color: orange. This is a deep dark orange though. One that goes rather well with the man's copious shading. Previous Brown books likeThe Curious Gardenhad fun with the borders, filling them with creeping smog around the edges. InCreepy Carrots!the borders now teem with encroaching darkness. Each picture is enclosed in a black border that seeps a foglike substance into the images. It's like watching a television show or a movie where you know something's gonna get the hero sometime. You just don't know when.Fair play to Brown with his carrots too. As you can see from the cover alone, he takes care to make them funny and scary all at once. They have a random smattering of gappy teeth like jack-o-lanterns, crossed eyes, and a variety of tops. They're like The Three Stooges in vegetable form, only more intimidating. Brown also makes the rather interesting decision to give much of this book a cutout feel. His style consists of drawing in pencil on paper and then digitally composing and coloring his images. The result is that he can give his scenes some real depth. That first shot of Jasper sitting merrily amongst the carrots really makes it look as if he's cut out from the scene, nearer the audience, much like the tufts of the trees behind him. And finally there's Jasper himself. You'd think the book would just feature the regular emotions like happy and frightened, but Brown does a lot more than that. The scene where Jasper laughs at himself for being so ridiculous to think that the carrots were following him is a triumph of mixed emotions. Worried eyes, smiling mouth, uncertain eyebrows, and hubris-filled ears. Beautiful stuff.Though it has absolutely nothing to do with Halloween, thanks to its black, white, and orange palette (to say nothing of its subject matter) expect to see this book read aloud in many a Halloween storytime for years and years to come. There are worse fates. I would simply remind everybody that scary books aren't seasonal. That kid who requested them of me asked me for them month after month, never tiring of what I put before him. Kids love to be scared within the safety of their parents' arms. Happy endings and gorgeous art are just a nice plus at that point. More fun than it deserves to be and thrilling to the core, expect to be asked to read this one over and over again and to willingly acquiesce so that you can pick out more details on a second, third, fortieth reading. A masterpiece of the scary/funny balance.For ages 4-8.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13259987-creepy-carrots,Creepy Carrots!.txt
The Rainbow Fish,"I'm always on the look-out for new, well-written children's books for my son. We had been reading him:Help! Mom! There Are Liberals Under My Bed!andWhy Mommy is a Democrat.He loved the story and drawings!However, he didn't seem to take to them as much as I thought he would...so I decided to find something else as informative, well-balanced and fun to read with my child.Then I came across The Rainbow Fish by Macrus Pfister.The Rainbow Fish is a story about a spectacular fish with amazing scales. Soon, other - boring fish - come and request a scale from the fish who turns them all down. The boring fish leave, causing the Rainbow Fish to be lonely. The Rainbow fish goes on a journey to discover why the other fish don't like him.The Rainbow Fish is soon told by the octopus that it is because he won't share his amazing scales. The Rainbow Fish then goes to the other fish and gives them his scales. Eventually all the fish have a shiny scale and the Rainbow Fish now has only one shiny scale left as well. The fish all play together happily. The end.Fantastic! A book about learning. Isn't that brilliant?I suggest that you go buy this book for your children. It's important that your children realize that it is NEVER okay to be different from other children. After all, we as people are not allowed to be stronger/weaker, smarter/less intellectual, creative/logical, physically, spiritually or emotionally better than others. In fact, we should ALL be the same.And it's also important that you teach your children that, in life, they are entitled. If someone has something more - then it is okay to expect that they give it to you. In fact, you should shun them if they don't. If you work hard and have much - please remember you must share it all. Even if you don't want to. Don't expect to be liked just for your personality. You must give everything you have to ensure that you are liked.Nothing is worse than being unliked. Don't let you children think differently or it could go very badly for them. Your individuality is not precious and there is no degree to which it can't be compromised in order to make people like you. Remember. WHO you are - your morals, intellect, personality and charm aren't nearly as important to you as they are to other people. Never be afraid to give away any part of yourself in order to be liked. Just like:See! Even culture can be bastardized to fit in!Maybe I am being the grinch. Maybe I am bespoiling a perfectly good children's book.Or maybe I'm just wondering what the world would be like if all the Rainbow Fish gave away their pretty scales until there weren't any Rainbow Fish anymore...Just think... we could all look like this! Who wants to share an earring?",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/766020.The_Rainbow_Fish,The Rainbow Fish.txt
The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales,"Now I guess I can to a certain extent appreciate the parodistic intent of Jon Scieszka'sThe Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales. However and that having all been said, Scieszka's retold narratives do not really work at all well for me as satires (as parodies), and primarily due to the fact there are simply far far too many tales presented. For honestly, as soon as the plot lines of the given stories ofThe Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Talesseem to become somewhat interesting and entertaining to and for me, there generally is an abrupt and rushed ending inserted by the author, and another, similarly choppy and equally annoyingly uneven tale commences (which sure does lead to potential distraction and for me, as well as massive tedium and frustration, and indeed so much so that I only very briefly and cursively skimmed the last three stories, and with scant regret).And while I am, in fact, still able to find a very select few of the ten or so adapted narratives ofThe Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Talespotentially funny and entertaining enough (as I will admit to chuckling a bit and with appreciation at the tale of the princess and the bowling ball and the story of the princess being tricked, being scammed by a non enchanted frog prince) even this truth, this factoid is simply NOT enough for me to rateThe Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Taleswith more than one star, well, actually with one and a half stars, if half stars were possible (as personally, the choppy and frustratingly uneven endings combined with the fact that I also rather majorly detest the accompanying illustrations, which while expressive and artistically competent, I just seem to find creepy and most aesthetically unpleasing, their Caldecott Honour designation for illustrator Lane Smith quite notwithstanding, all of this really does make me rather majorly dislikeThe Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Talesand indeed in every way).",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/407429.The_Stinky_Cheese_Man_and_Other_Fairly_Stupid_Tales,The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales.txt
The Lightning Thief,"Chiron looked surprised. “I thought that would be obvious enough.The entrance to the Underworld is in Los Angeles.”As someone who has worked in Los Angeles, I can tell you that this is completely accurate.While Harry Potter was spending his summers at the Dursleys, Percy Jackson attended Camp Half-Blood. This book has done the impossible:it has redeemed the name of Percy.Yes, that's right, that snot-faced, lily-livered waste of air of the very same name from theHarry Potteruniverse. That name is now relegated to the ranks of ""acceptable,"" because of my love for this book.Perseus (Percy) Jackson is the kind of kid with whom you can't help sympathizing. He is the type that's born under a dark star, because inevitably, wherever he goes, whatever he does, however good his intentions, he can't help but fuck everything up. Everything that can, does and will go wrong. A simple field trip can turn into a disaster in seconds.Jay-Z's got 99 problems, Percy might have more. He nearly flunks all his classes, he's got dyslexia, he's got ADHD, and then there's Nancy Bobofit.Nancy Bobofit appeared in front of me with her ugly friends—I guess she’d gotten tired of stealing from the tourists—and dumped her half-eaten lunch in Grover’s lap.“Oops.” She grinned at me with her crooked teeth. Her freckles were orange, as if somebody had spray-painted her face with liquid Cheetos.Nancy Bobofit is not a major character in the book. I have to mention her because her character resounded with me. I had my own Nancy Bobofit back in grade school, only her name is Mimi. Nearly 2 decades later, the memory of her horrible face still makes me shudder. But I digress.As if the bullies aren't bad enough, his dad is a no-show, his stepfather is LITERALLY named Ugli, and there are crones foretelling Percy's death as well as a minotaur chasing his ass around. AND NOBODY'S TELLING HIM A SINGLE FUCKING THING. What's with all the secrecy, man?As it turned out, Percy is *whispers* special. He is a half-blood, meaning one of his parents is a Greek deity. He gets sent to Camp Half-Blood, with roughly 100 other kids like him.It's a freaky place for a kid who's known nothing but relative normalcy his entire life. All of a sudden, he's playing Pinochle with a Greek God (Dionysus---what a drunk), his best friend Grover turns out to be a satyr, and the gorgeous blond girl who rescues him thinks he's a doofus and she keeps calling him""seaweed brain.""To be fair, Percy had it coming. He is kind of a seaweed brain.""Another time, Athena and Poseidon competed to be the patron god for the city of Athens. Your dad created some stupid saltwater spring for his gift. My mom created the olive tree. The people saw that her gift was better, so they named the city after her.”“They must really like olives.”“Oh, forget it.”“Now, if she’d invented pizza—that I could understand.”“I said, forget it!”Not your best moment, Percy.As it turned out, Percy IS special. His dad is one of the Big Three gods. Which kind of sucks, because that's not supposed to happen.“About sixty years ago, after World War II, the Big Three agreed they wouldn’t sire any more heroes. Their children were just too powerful.""A lot of people would think it was pretty cool to have such a powerful dad...not really.Now that I was declared a son of one of the Big Three gods who weren’t supposed to have kids, I figured it was a crime for me just to be alive.Not only does Percy have to struggle to fit in at Camp Half-Blood, but there's some shit going on in Mount Olympus. The gods are fighting again (when are they not)...""During the winter solstice, at the last council of the gods, Zeus and Poseidon had an argument. The usual nonsense: ‘Mother Rhea always liked you best,’ ‘Air disasters are more spectacular than sea disasters,’ et cetera.""...and consequently, like a brother playing a prank on his younger siblings, someone's stuff was stolen. And Zeus thinks that his bro, Poseidon, put Percy up to it.Of course, blame the poor kid. Now Percy is shit out of luck YET AGAIN, and he's got no choice but to go on this huge stupid quest into the underworld (Los Angeles, ha!) to clear his name.He's not alone, he's accompanied by thesnarky, gorgeous, fiercely competent Annabeth(she of the seaweed brain name-calling), as well asthe most incompetent satyr that ever lived.In his pocket was a set of reed pipes his daddy goat had carved for him, even though he only knew two songs: Mozart’s Piano Concerto no. 12 and Hilary Duff’s “So Yesterday,” both of which sounded pretty bad on reed pipes.It's going to be a loooooooong trip to the Underworld.The Setting: THIS. THIS IS HOW YOU DO GREEK MYTHOLOGY. I am a Greek mythology buff. I FUCKING LOVED THIS BOOK. This book is just absolutely fucking perfect in every way when it comes to rewriting and reinterpreting the Greek pantheon. It is so hilariously, awesomely irreverent, but completely fitting. The gods are reimagined, but they stay true to their true nature, andthe myths are retold in a cheeky, flippant manner that had me giggling my ass off. This book is so fantastically snarky to the Greek gods. Everything is incredibly well-explained to a lay audience, like how the Greek gods can't seem to keep it in their pants.Annabeth nodded. “Your father isn’t dead, Percy. He’s one of the Olympians.”“That’s...crazy.”“Is it? What’s the most common thing gods did in the old stories? They ran around falling in love with humans and having kids with them. Do you think they’ve changed their habits in the last few millennia?”And apparently, the habit runs true for both male and female goddesses.“What? You assume it has to be a male god who finds a human female attractive? How sexist is that?”The existence of Greek gods and goddesses themselves are well explained, and believable.“Come now, Percy. What you call ‘Western civilization.’ Do you think it’s just an abstract concept? No, it’s a living force. A collective consciousness that has burned bright for thousands of years. The gods are part of it.""""Did the West die? The gods simply moved, to Germany, to France, to Spain, for a while. Wherever the flame was brightest, the gods were there. They spent several centuries in England. All you need to do is look at the architecture. People do not forget the gods.""I had my doubts about the execution of the premise of Greek mythology, and all my doubts have been destroyed.his book does great justice to the Greek gods, it is the most faithful rendition than I have ever read.The Characters: Yes, Percy is a special snowflake, but HELL, I LOVED THE LITTLE SHIT. He's got a special destiny. He is a special child. I DON'T CARE. Percy is such a sympathetic character, and although he won't be replacing Harry Potter in my heart any time soon, there is a special spot for him. He can give up pretty fast. He's kind of a wimp, but you know, finding out that you're a hald-blooded demigod is kind of a big deal, and I understand his attitude of ""GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.""I didn’t know what else to do. I waved back.“Don’t encourage them,” Annabeth warned. “Naiads are terrible flirts.”“Naiads,” I repeated, feeling completely overwhelmed. “That’s it. I want to go home now.”He doesn't really want to do anything big. He's pretty stupid sometimes (Auntie Em, geez), he's not exactly heroic. He only does the heroic shit when there are no other options.“All right,” I said. “It’s better than being turned into a dolphin.”I loved Annabeth, she is all I could want from a female supporting character. I can't say that I'm fond of Grover...but I can't help feeling that we'll be seeing more of him in the future.“But a quest to . . .” Grover swallowed. “I mean, couldn’t the master bolt be in some place like Maine? Maine’s very nice this time of year.”Overall: a fantastic book.A good middle grade book makes you feel like a child again, and this book did just the trick.I found myself giggling throughout the book, and an hour after reading it, there's still a smile on my face that can't be wiped off.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123675190-the-lightning-thief,The Lightning Thief.txt
Room on the Broom,"Growing upI grew up in a tall Victorian London house with my parents, grandmother, aunt, uncle, younger sister Mary and cat Geoffrey (who was really a prince in disguise. Mary and I would argue about which of us would marry him).Mary and I were always creating imaginary characters and mimicking real ones, and I used to write shows and choreograph ballets for us. A wind-up gramophone wafted out Chopin waltzes.I studied Drama and French at Bristol University, where I met Malcolm, a guitar-playing medic to whom I’m now married.Busking and booksBefore Malcolm and I had our three sons we used to go busking together and I would write special songs for each country; the best one was in Italian about pasta.The busking led to a career in singing and songwriting, mainly for children’s television. I became an expert at writing to order on such subjects as guinea pigs, window-cleaning and horrible smells. “We want a song about throwing crumpled-up wrapping paper into the bin” was a typical request from the BBC.I also continued to write “grown-up” songs and perform them in folk clubs and on the radio, and have recently released two CDs of these songs.One of my television songs, A SQUASH AND A SQUEEZE, was made into a book in 1993, with illustrations by the wonderful Axel Scheffler. It was great to hold the book in my hand without it vanishing in the air the way the songs did. This prompted me to unearth some plays I’d written for a school reading group, and since then I’ve had 20 plays published. Most children love acting and it’s a tremendous way to improve their reading.My real breakthrough was THE GRUFFALO, again illustrated by Axel. We work separately - he’s in London and I’m in Glasgow - but he sends me letters with lovely funny pictures on the envelopes.I really enjoy writing verse, even though it can be fiendishly difficult. I used to memorise poems as a child and it means a lot to me when parents tell me their child can recite one of my books.Funnily enough, I find it harder to write not in verse, though I feel I am now getting the hang of it! My novel THE GIANTS AND THE JONESES is going to be made into a film by the same team who made the Harry Potter movies, and I have written three books of stories about the anarchic PRINCESS MIRROR-BELLE who appears from the mirror and disrupts the life of an otherwise ordinary eight-year-old. I have just finished writing a novel for teenagers.When I’m not writing I am often performing, at book festivals and in theatres. I really enjoy getting the children in the audience to help me act out the stories and sing the songs. When Malcolm can take time off from the hospital he and his guitar come too. and it feels as if we’ve come full circle - back to busking.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/177246.Room_on_the_Broom,Room on the Broom.txt
Pete the Cat: I Love My White Shoes,"My latest storytime discovery combines my two loves: a positive attitude and, well, shoes. Pretty genius!Meet this happy go-lucky cat out for a stroll in his brand new white shoes when he happens to step in a huge pile of strawberries! ""What color did it turn his shoes?""Shoe transformation occurs three more times with varying slants (and oddly enough, another mountain of fruit) but each time, ""Did Pete cry?"" ""Goodness, no! He kept walking along and singing his song.""Pete's song, ""I love my ________ shoes,"" repeated three times, invites audience participation along with the direct, reoccurring questions above. The rustic, colorful illustrations capture the casual, go with the flow nature of this zen cat whose expression remains the same throughout the story. The moral is clearly stated at the end: ""no matter what you step in, keep walking along and singing your song... because it's all good.""Whether children will note the lesson of this big picture perspective and find beauty in their own mistakes is questionable, but also beside the point when the story is so enjoyable.Thank you to my amazing co-worker Rebecca for sharing the book with me!",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6871646-pete-the-cat,Pete the Cat I Love My White Shoes.txt
"Goodnight, Dragons","This book is about a young boy who takes a nap under a tree in the forest. While he sleeps he dreams of the many dragons that live within the forest. He feels that his mission is to tame the dragons and comfort them. His plan is to gather all the tools he will need and set off to find the dragons with his horse, who is actually his cute little pup. He knows they will be grumpy and therefore need love. Once he is able to find the dragons, he takes them under his wing. He gives them just what they need to be tamed… a warm blanket and a cup of hot chocolate! The dragons are then calmed and ready for a good night's sleep, good night, dragons! One of the major themes in this book is caring for those who might need extra care. They might have an attitude or seem to not want to be bothered, but if you keep trying you will realize that all they needed was a nice gesture. The genre of this book is fantasy. If I were to read this book to children, I would teach them how important it is to be a nice person. Everyone needs a friend, and everyone needs a hug from time to time. If we were to all be that person then the world might be a better place. I would also teach them about courage, although you know some things might be hard, it is still good to face them. And when you do face them, you will see how strong you are and what difference you can make. Just like when the little boy was able to tame the fierce dragons! This book is a WOW book for me because of the story that is behind the words. I myself need courage sometimes, and when I do finish what I thought I could not, it makes me realize how strong I can be. It also reminds me of dreaming, our dreams can sometimes face things we cannot, and it is often a great place to be!Some of the literary devices the author uses are similes. Her similes compare things that we often know. Therefore, we can understand what the character was experiencing as well. As I am sure we all know the horrible smell of burnt toast or the comforting feeling of wrapping up in our favorite blanket. I would consider this book to be anti-bias because we are reading a book that is about setting aside differences and not projecting common beliefs.

How to Catch a Unicorn,"🦄Happy Unicorn Day!🦄This was everything I want in a unicorn book! It was a fun read and the illustrations were bright and colourful, with plenty of glitter and rainbows (plus the requisite reference to unicorn flatulence).From ice cream traps to butterfly nets, a group of kids try their best to catch a wiley unicorn through the zoo’s exhibits but this unicorn has a host of animal friends ready to help it evade capture.I smiled my way through this book and particularly lovedAndy Elkerton’s illustrations. I enjoyed the various expressions on the kids’ faces when their attempts to catch the unicorn didn’t quite go to plan. My favourite near miss resulted in a couple of kids getting soaked by some penguins. I couldn’t choose a favourite animal because they’re all amazing; they’re full of joy and adorably cheeky as they foil the kids’ plan.I really appreciated the creative substitution of the unicorn horn and star for the “i” in the book’s title. Oftentimes it’s the little extras that make a book memorable long term for me and it wouldn’t surprise me if that sparkly yellow “i” is one of the things that find its way into my spontaneous recommendation to some unsuspecting book store visitor weeks or months from now.I’ve read this book three times (so far) and plan to read it every day until I have no choice but to return it to the library. I previously fell in love withHow to Catch a Monster, which I reviewedhere. Now it’s a given that I need to get my hands on the rest ofAdam Wallace’sHow to Catchseries.P.S.

"Hey, Al","Hey, Al is A Caldecott Medal winning picture written by Arthur Yorinks. Al is a quiet Janitor who lives with his talking dog, Eddie in a messy one-bedroom apartment. One day, a large bird pitched an idea to Al and Eddie to leave their messy lifestyle and take an adventure to a beautiful land. However, this paradise does not turn out like it seemed it would and Al and Eddie are forced to escape. The book is wonderfully illustrated with earthy tones throughout the whole book. The illustrators use Realism throughout in each picture. In the beginning of the book, the pictures are limited to a small box that does not take up the whole page, and later on the whole page is used for the illustrations. This book is wonderfully written and definitely deserves the Caldecott Medal.•	The problem in the book is almost immediately made known. On page 2 the dog does like where they live, and he wants a nice background to run around in. ““the moon? The moon? Eddie Howled. “Pigeons live better than us!””•	The author uses italics to put emphasis on words; this draws the reader’s attention to the importance of that word in the sentence. For example, “Al, Al, Al! You need a change. Tomorrow, come and be my guest. Eddie, too. You’ll see, you’ll love.” (pg3)•	The theme in this book can easily be that the grass is not always greener on the other side. “But ripe fruit soon spoils” (page 9). The book almost reads off what the theme is to be.•	The mood in the book starts off very melancholy at first. The characters do not have much to be happy about, and they dream of a better life. However, at the end of the book they are very thankful for the things they have and would never wish for something different again.•	There was not an overwhelming amount of didacticism in this book, however, there was an underlying message to be noticed. The book was strangely put together, but the moral of the story wasn’t made overly cheesy.•	The author was setting the tone for a very thoughtful book. This book would be very silly if the author had not previously brought in the issue of the characters not having enough money.•	The author develops the characters throughout the book to become more thankful for each other and the simple life that they lead. The author does this through dialogue between the characters describing what they think about the experience. “Paradise lost is sometimes heaven found” (page 28). The author uses this to show the new meaning of what the characters have in their home.•	The text is very realistic and there are not many figurative language devices used throughout the book. This offers a more realistic and relational feel to the reader.•	When reading this to kids, they can relate by learning to be grateful for what they have.•	It is sort of ironic when on Al says “a guy could live like this forever”, because eventually Al and Eddie are trying their hardest to break out of the fake paradise.Arthur Yorinks was born in New York and grew to love art through watching his mother as he grew up. Yorinks writing style is very unique and realistic. He tends to bring in very normal issues through a very odd story. He mostly uses italics to emphasize words throughout book, but does not use any other figurative language or other type of writing style.When discussing the book as far as writing goes some editors say, “This story helps to teach children that the green is not always greener on the other side. This story has a strong plot that shows the difficult decision that Al needs to make whether he should stay on the island or if he wants to go back to his old life. The plot style that is used is person vs self. By using this plot style Yorinks is able to show how Al is able to make a decision and how it betters his life”. However, not everyone is fond of this book, and think that “Did not like this random, disconnected book that seemed like the authors chopped up their original story and gave us the bits and pieces”.The best parts about this book were the illustrations and realistic in which they were presented:•	The style throughout this book was definitely realism. There were no weirdly shaped animals, and the colors matched really well with what was being depicted.•	The author uses painting as its form of media throughout the whole book.•	The lines throughout the whole book are rather smooth and are not very sharp. There is very inviting to the readers eyes and gives the book a softer feel.•	On page 13, on the left hand side there is a bird with a human hand. This is ironic, because the characters will soon be changing into birds themselves.•	The flowers the birds are giving them are yellow (page 13) which is meant to be a sign of caution or happiness.•	The text is almost not needed for the illustrations to make a story. However, they both play work together very well. One does over power the other.•	It was interesting that each picture in the apartment was also drawn a little bit from the outside. This gave a 3D look to the illustrations•	When Al and Eddie were in “paradise” the lines appeared to be a little smoother than normal and when they were back in their apartment the lines had more edges and heaviness to them. This was meant to emphasize that paradise was more relaxing and safe.•	The overall mood of the illustrations was very welcoming and engaging. The illustrations scream to be looked over and studied for longer than a few seconds.•	The colors are lighter and more earth toned, this gives a lighthearted feel to throughout, and is more welcoming and appealing to the reader’s eyes.Richard Egielski was born in New York as well. He grew up always loving art, which led him to attend New York High School for Art and Design. For many years his artwork was considered strange and out of the ordinary until he met Arthur, who though his work was incredible. The two paired together to make the award book Hey, Al.Overall, the editors online loved the illustrations in this book. Some thought that, “the facial emotions that were illustrated on Al’s character because it was easy to tell how he was feeling despite the narrators commentary of the situation.” While other readers felt that “The illustrations of the birds are amazing! The use of two-page spreads for paradise and the confined look of Al's apartment work well. One of my favorite quirky picture books”. The illustrations really won over many of the readers.I was able to read this book with my 2-year-old nephew, and he was not able to sit through it. The book is more suitable for children older than 5 years. Although, my nephew really did enjoy pointing all the birds and asking them to say, “tweet tweet”. I really thought this book was different and had a lot of great things within. The illustrations were definitely my favorite part. I did think the story was a little quirky, but it was nice reading a different typed of children’s book.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/526077.Hey_Al,"Hey, Al.txt"
The Funny Little Woman,"I have been reading many folktales from Japan for many years now, but if there was one Japanese folktale that I was pleasantly surprised in liking, it would be “The Funny Little Woman,” retold by Arlene Mosel along with illustrations by Blair Lent and has won the Caldecott Medal. This story is truly fun and fascinating to read for anyone who is a fan of Japanese folktales!In this story, there was once a little woman who had the habit of laughing at every single thing. One day, she was making her rice dumplings when one of the dumplings fell through a hole in the ground. When the little woman tried to get it, she ended up falling into the hole and into the underground home of the wicked Oni. The Oni wanted the little woman to cook rice for them and even though the little woman cooked for them, she was starting to get homesick and she tried to find ways to get back home.Arlene Mosel’s retelling of this ancient Japanese story was truly hilarious and intense at the same time as I loved the little woman’s adventures in the Oni world! I really loved the way that Arlene Mosel wrote the little woman as being a truly unique character as she never stops laughing, which is a characteristic I found endearing and she has no fear of the dreaded Oni. I also loved the tension that the Oni had brought to the story as I was seriously sitting on the edge of my seat trying to see if the little woman would be able to escape from the Oni. Blair Lent’s artwork is truly creative as the colorings of the artwork splits up between the little woman’s home above ground and the Oni world underground. I find it surprising that the Oni world is in color while the little woman’s home above ground is in black and white colorings (although earlier on in the book, the little woman’s home above ground was still in color until she fell into the Oni world). I found this transition between the two worlds to be extremely creative as we are able to see effectively how much time the little woman spent in the Oni world while life goes on above the Oni world. I also loved the appearance of the Oni themselves as they look truly frightening as they are shown in blue colorings and have three eyes on their heads and sharp teeth, which shows how threatening they could be to the main protagonist of the story.Parents should know that the Oni might scare smaller children, especially for the fact that they kidnapped the little woman and forced her to cook for them. Parents might want to use this story as an opportunity to teach their children about the dangers of approaching unknown places alone and how they should deal with these situations.Overall, “The Funny Little Woman” is a truly fantastic tale about the danger of wondering into strange places that both parents and kids will enjoy for many years! I would recommend this book to children ages five and up since the scenes with the Oni might scare smaller children.Review is also on:Rabbit Ears Book Blog",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/278435.The_Funny_Little_Woman,The Funny Little Woman.txt
Inkheart,"Ah! A book about a magical book!!How delightful!Twelve year old Meggie lives in a small farmhouse with her father, Mo, as Meggie calls him, who repairs and restores books. Meggie doesn't think that 'bookbinder' describes the care and love her father takes when he's fixing books and prefers to say that he's a ""book doctor."" He has a plaque on the bookshop door that reads:Some books should be tastedsome devouredbut only a fewshould be chewed and digested thoroughly.One dark and rainy night, a stranger arrives at the door. Mo invites him in, saying he's a ""friend"" and sends Meggie roughly back to bed. Mo has never treated her that way but more than that, Meggie senses fear, like icy fingers around her heart, and a feeling of foreboding surrounding the visitor. And something else, a familiarity deep down that she can't explain. What kind of friend comes knocking in the middle of the night? Not easily dissuaded, Meggie creeps out of bed and listens through the door. She hears Mo call the visitorDustfingerwho then calls her fatherSilvertongue.Then the voices become only low murmurs, a hushed argument of sorts.""don't underestimate him""she heard Dustfinger say.""He'd do anything to get hold of it"" .....""And when I say 'anything,' I can assure you I mean anything.""......""I'll never let him have it.""That was Mo. ...""Oh, yes? And for how much longer, do you think? What about your daughter?....Meggie wonders what the strange names mean, including the other one Dustfinger said""Capricorn""and what could he want that Mo will never give up?Very early the next morning Mo tells Meggie to pack quickly, that they're going to visit his aunt Elinor who needs some of her books repaired. Meggie is confused as she still has a week of school left but Mo, not in the mood to argue, has been unusually distressed since Dustfinger's arrival and is clearly in a hurry to leave.And, as always, he reminds her to pack plenty of books to read. He's always says""It's a good idea to have your own books with you when you're in a strange place.""They just reach the gate when Dustfinger suddenly appears in the road and says he's coming along. This seems to upset Mo even more and Meggie, still fearful, isn't at all happy, either.As the journey lags on the discord between Mo and Dustfinger continues and Meggie knows something is being kept secret from her, something to do with a book she saw Mo hide in his suitcase, something that has Mo very anxious and worried.Elinor's house is enormous with bookshelves full of books, floor to ceiling in every room. In addition, Elinor makes it very apparent that she doesn't care for children. Not at all.Late that first night Meggie hears Mo and Elinor whispering about hiding the book so it can never be found. Only a little while later, that very night, men come and steal the book, taking Mo with them. The book was indeed kept safe and the men will soon discover that they have the wrong book. What will happen to Mo then?Elinor dislikes and doesn't trust Dustfinger but he says he knows where Mo has been taken leaving Meggie and Elinor no choice but to trust him to take them to exchange the book for Mo. Elinor finds she was right not to trust Dustfinger as he's deceived them, leading them right into a trap. They've been taken by gun point and reunited with Mo but are now locked up, terrified, and at the complete mercy of Capricorn.Mo has no choice but to tell Maggie the secret he's been hiding, why he's never read out loud to her, and about what really happened to her mother when Meggie was just three years old.Mo explains to Meggie that he can literally read characters out of a book.Mo was reading INKHART aloud to Meggie's mother when suddenly Capricorn appeared in their living room, along with a few of his men.And her mother was gone. Vanished.Mo managed to escape with Meggie, and the book and has been hiding from Capricorn ever since.Now, Meggie and Elinor are beginning to understand why Capricorn won't let them go now that he has the book. He needs Mo to read aloud everything he wants out of the book including gold and treasure. Dustfinger, too, has his own selfish adjenda for getting his hands on the book as he, himself, was read from the pages of INKHEART, and he wants to go back. More than anything in this world.Mo has refused to do what Capricorn wants thus far. And for good reason.But now, thanks to Dustfinger, Capricorn finally has everything he needs to make Mo obey. He has his Daughter, Meggie.And that's just the beginning.InkheartbyCornelia Funkeis a magical adventure that I found very hard to put down.It was everything a great story should be. A believable story line with magic for added fun and adventure. Endearing characters in Mo, Meggie, and Elinor who have me looking forward to reading their further adventures inInkspell. Characters who are merciless and evil, who have no quandary about deceit, ruthlessness, and murder. It all goes flat out which I found surprising as it's a 500+ page book. It's an exciting and original story with lots of uncertainty and anticipation throughout that never loses momentum and keeps you guessing from beginning to end. I was drawn straight in and I found myself captivated within the pages for hours on end, turning the pages as fast as could to see what might happen next. I got goose bumps on countless occasions!Oh! What a sensational adventure!! I highly recommend it to anyone who loves books. Books to read, collect, and treasure.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28194.Inkheart,Inkheart.txt

Bridge to Terabithia,"Here’s another ""great"" book about a dysfunctional group of people. (This family might even be worse than the family in Al Capone Does My Shirts). I can’t remember a single time the entire family got along – including Christmas! But if you’re wanting some world-class sibling fight scenes, look no further. There’s some prize-winning battles in here.Along with the constant brawls, is the continuous use of the Lord’s name. I’m not sure why the family mentions God so often since after the mother got mad at the preacher three years ago, they only attend church on Easter; not that the rest of the family cares – they all think church is boring.And then there’s the crush the boy has on his teacher. But it seems to be reciprocated. What’s up with that? She gives this ten-year-old special attention in class, even taking him out for a day (just the two of them – kind of like a “date”).While the book does end with the brother taking his little sister into his imaginary land (in the place of his friend), I just can’t see that that makes up for everything else. That’s a lot of wading just to get to something like three sweet paragraphs at the end.Children's Bad WordsMild Obscenities & Substitutions - 17 Incidents: crud, shut up, d*mn, b*tched, durn, durned, heck, dang, h*llName Calling - 23 Incidents: hippie, peacenik, stupid, dumbhead, Yellow-bellied sapsucker, dumb, yeller, dumb, dunce, dumb dodoScatological Terms - 1 Incident: bl**dy (as in lots of blood)Religious Profanities - 42 Incidents: Lord, thank the Lord, for heaven's sake, good gosh, oh my GodReligious & Supernatural - 17 Incidents: Magic ""...it could be a magic country like Narnia...""

'Amen.'"" A boy makes a girl swear on the Bible never to tell a secret he wants to keep. Church attendance ""Since Momma got mad at the preacher three years back, Easter was the only time in the year that the Aarons went to church and it was a big deal. His mother always cried poor, but she put a lot of thought and as much money as she could scrape together into making sure she wouldn't be embarrassed by how her family looked."" Children fight, not wanting to attend church. The argument is primarily about clothes. Church is referred to as ""boring."" ""Ellie said she would go to church if Momma would let her wear the see-through blouse, and Brenda would go if she at least got a new skirt.""

He ought to have friends his own age and let her have hers."" Smoke is mentioned ""Besides, the smoke is so thick in there you need a gas mask."" Again, a girl has more compassion for animals than people and is prodded by a boy to do the right thing/good deed for a person: ""He looked at her. 'Well,' he said. 'What should we do?' 'Do?' she asked. 'What do you mean what should we do?' How could he explain it to her? 'Leslie. If she was an animal predator, we'd be obliged to try to help her.' Leslie gave him a funny look.""

It is noted that a girl was cremated. Again it is questioned whether or not people are appropriately grieving for the girl who died.Parent TakeawayThe family in this story is entirely dysfunctional and it is paraded throughout the entire book. The parents do not get along with each other or the children, and the siblings do not get along either. There is constant fighting, taunting and lying. Maybe the only redeeming relational quality is that at the very end of the book, the main character invites his sister to be queen of his imaginary land of Terabithia. The two main characters have some odd discussions about Christianity and God, particularly about hell; and there is a few humanistic thoughts woven here and there. The main characters are definitely not examples of great character.**Like my reviews? Then you should follow me! Because I have hundreds more just like this one.

Elmer,"Elmerthe very young elephant is just that little bit different. He lives with a herd of elephants. They might be young or old, tall or short, fat or thin. In fact there are many variations in how they look. But they are all the same colour. All except Elmer. Elmer is quirky. He is most decidedly not the same colour as the other elephants.Elmer is a beautiful kaleidoscope of all sorts of colours. His body is a patchwork of yellow, orange, red, pink, purple, blue, green, black and white. His personality is also larger than life and matches his appearance. Elmer is cheerful, optimistic and sometimes very silly. He absolutely loves practical jokes.“If there was even a little smile, it was usually Elmer who started it.”But one night Elmer began to worry. He couldn’t sleep for thinking.“And the think that he was thinking was that he was tired of being different.”Why did he look so different from all the others. Was that why they were laughing at him? So, sadly, he crept away, determined to somehow cover himself with grey, so that he would blend in with the others.So he disguised himself, with the help of some berries, and it seemed to work! Nobody recognised him on his return, and even his friends greeted him politely, but rather distantly. Why were they all so serious, quiet and morose?“Elmer felt that something was wrong ... the more he looked at the serious, silent, still standing elephants, the more he wanted to laugh. Finally he could bear it no longer ...”When he did what only Elmer could have done, all the elephants became helpless with laughter too. They were overjoyed to have Elmer back in their midst again. And then the weather changed so that magically Elmer’s true colours were revealed. Everyone in the herd was so happy to have their popular prankster back that they decided to celebrate with a special day every year, On“Elmer’s Day”, every elephant would decorate themselves with unique and colourful patterns, and Elmer must decorate himself to look ... yes, you’ve guessed it!So every year, on the day of the parade,“if you happen to see an elephant ordinary elephant colour, you will know it must be Elmer.”The author ofElmer, David McKee, originally comes from South Devon, in England. He has produced mainly children’s books and animations, including several other series. Sometimes David McKee uses the pseudonym Violet Easton. He has illustrated books by other authors, such as some recent“Paddington Bear”books, and those by his wife, Violet McKee, and his son, Chuck McKee. The first book that he sold was of a story he had told at college,“Two Can Toucan”, which is also still in print.Elmeris an absolutely delightful picture book.“Elmer the Patchwork Elephant”by David McKee was originally published in 1968, and has been in print ever since. The current edition uses illustrations by the author from 1985. In this edition, the nameELMERis printed on the cover in shiny gold, reflective print.Elmerhas now featured in 34 books by David McKee, and the series has sold nearly 5 million copies in 40 languages around the world. It is as popular as ever. Serendipitously, just as all the elephants in this story celebrate“Elmer Day”at the end of the story, this year the publishers declared 28th May 2016, to be “Elmer Day”. Across Great Britain, libraries and bookshops have held Elmer-themed events. David McKee himself has producedElmerboard books, bath books, colouring books, an Elmer flap book, an Elmer hole-in-the-page book and an Elmer pop-up book. The character ofElmeralso stars in a children’s television series.From the start of this first story, the message is clear. Elmer is different, but he is accepted and valued just the way he is. He is unique and has a special talent to make everyone happy. When he alters his appearance and no longer looks like himself, he is ignored by his friends. He experiences what it feels like to be treated like an outcast, and to be ostracised by his old friends. In this book children may begin to think of the value of friendship and family, identity and diversity, as well as being true to oneself. When Elmer’s true colours are revealed, his friends are surprised and delighted. They much prefer his multicoloured and fun loving persona, and reassure Elmer that they love him because of his differences, and not in spite of them.The three year old next door loved this book as much as I did. He could quickly see the elephant shape on the cover, (although at first glance to me it looked like an abstract pattern). He was very keen to name all the colours he saw, and very keen too to spot and identify all the animals in the jungle scenes. It proved to be a real page-turner, with him squealing in delight at the big“BOO”in the middle of the book, and his insistence on turning the page at the end himself, to see all the highly decorated elephants on the last two pages. My little Turkish friend wanted to keep this one, to read over and over again, rather than to return it to the library.David McKee has a keen insight into what will appeal to little children, a lovely way with words, producing bold and attractive illustrations, and a story with a strong heart at its core. It doesn’t get any better than this.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1223119.Elmer,Elmer.txt
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"Mother nature cooks up a storm, literally, in this madcap story with plenty of silliness to go around.Ages 4-10The town of Chewandswallow has some wild weather, bringing meals like burgers, spaghetti, mashed potatoes, and of course meatballs three times a day. Then, things start to go crazy and odd things start happening, like an entire day of just gargonzola cheese and eventually a ""tomato tornado"" and the poor sanitation department could no longer keep up. This book uses such fun language to describe weather effects, like drizzle, clearings, and downpour. The language is delightful and the illustrations, while not overly colorful, are still detailed and fun. The absurdity and silliness in this story make it a joy to read and the combining of two familiar concepts, food and weather, into one story are sure to stoke the imagination. Kids of this age group will love the fanciful, over the top, giant ideas presented in this book.About This BookHere's another wonderfully written and illustrated story by the Barrett team. Receiving a place on the prestigious New York Times Best Illustrated Children's Books of the Year list, this book skillfully and subtly blends funny storytelling and full-color illustrations with a very real twist about how weather can affect people's environments.Life in the wonderful town of ChewandSwallow is great: Some of its citizens even say it's downright delicious! Instead of snow, wind, or rain, they get a different kind of weather that falls from the sky three times a day: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The only bad part about living in ChewandSwallow is that the people don't get their choice of what they'd like to fall from the sky: it may snow mashed potatoes, or rain juice or soup, or there might even be a storm of hamburgers that takes them by surprise. But no one is too worried about the weather, until it takes a turn for the worse — the portions of food get larger and larger and fall faster and faster, until everyone in the town fears for their lives. They all need to think of a plan, and they need one fast! With teamwork, smarts, and some extra-large bagels, Chewandswallow residents are able to save themselves from the torrential weather. A cheerful approach to gearing up for a science lesson or just for reading aloud, this book makes food and weather fun.A good review and I agree that it is a good starting point for a weather discussion, especially because of the great terms used in the story.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8073.Cloudy_with_a_Chance_of_Meatballs,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.txt
Deadhouse Gates,"A book that is epic in both scope and narrative - but for me a book where the payoff of the destination, was not quite worth the effort of the journey....Final Rating: 3.6/5🌕🌕🌕🌗🌑I wanted to love this, but overall it was a step down for me from The Gardens of the Moon. While they were both equally complex, I felt that there just wasn't as much of an epic ending in this book as there was in the first. Indeed, when people speak of the ""epic ending"" in this book I'm still not actually sure which part or storyline they're referring to. Which is never a good sign. That said, I'm still very keen to continue with the series and am just hoping that the next book in the series finally ""clicks"" for me :)ColtainePlot Summary""Deadhouse Gates"", the second book in the Malazan Book of the Fallen series, shifts the action to the continent of Seven Cities, on the brink of a holy rebellion known as the Whirlwind. The plot follows multiple characters, such as Felisin, a young noblewoman sold into slavery, and Kalam, an assassin with plans to kill the Empress. Among the most memorable plotlines is the journey of Coltaine, a Malazan commander guiding a host of refugees through hostile desert lands. The narrative balances numerous threads, diving deep into the rich history, culture, and magic of the Malazan world, culminating in a complex tale of survival and sacrifice.““Children are dying.""Lull nodded. ""That's a succinct summary of humankind, I'd say. Who needs tomes and volumes of history? Children are dying. The injustices of the world hide in those three words.””Storyline: 2.5/5When it comes to narrative, ""Deadhouse Gates"" is no doubt an epic. Erikson spins a yarn filled with countless characters, vast landscapes, and intertwining plotlines. Each storyline carries its own weight, and when they converge, the result can be pretty awe-inspiring. The Chain of Dogs plotline, for instance, is an emotional rollercoaster, a tale of courage and sacrifice that stands out amidst the narrative tapestry.However, in this instance I found that the complexity of the narrative was a bit too much to handle. There are so many (new) characters and plots to follow that it feels like you're navigating a maze without a map. Erikson certainly doesn't coddle his readers; he expects you to piece it all together yourself. While some might appreciate this approach, I found it a bit overwhelming (even with the help of a readers guide). It often felt more like work than enjoyment to keep up with all the details and connect the dots.I normally don't mind work in a fantasy book, indeed I kind of expect it as you get the world built out before you, so that it all culminates is some epic payoff. Seeing all those scattered puzzle pieces finally come together, witnessing the evolution of characters, and experiencing the climax of each storyline can be satisfying. But, at least for me, this book got that calculation off by a wide margin. The effort required to reach that payoff was just a too steep. And the narrative while there is certainly a narrative payoff, no doubt, the reward didn't make up for the complexity of the climb. I remember saying to myself through the first 600 pages, it'll be worth it in the end just keep going. Then in the final 200 I kept asking, when is the payoff going to get here? Then in the last 50, I realised that the small narrative climax I'd just passed was not a false peak, it was the actual peak (""Was that the AMAZING ending people that people kept telling me about?""). So in terms of scope, it's a narrative marvel for sure, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that a more accessible path to the payoff (or a epic ending similar to Gardens of the Moon) would have made the experience more enjoyable.“The lesson of history is that no one learns.”Characterisation: 3.5/5I'm in two minds about characterisation in this book. The first part of me thinks that the characters in ""Deadhouse Gates"" are really out of this world in terms of how they're written - although many of them are very unlikeable. The second part of me though really disliked how we didn't get to follow on with the stories of characters from the first book, because Erikson decided to start a whole new slate of story lines. I think I get why he did it (and that he'll continue to do it throughout this series), but chopping and changing like that really isn't my cup of tea.If I just look at the characters in ""Deadhouse Gates"" though, they truly are something else. Erikson rolls out a whole new cast, each with their own unique backstory and motivations. You've got characters like Fiddler, whose quiet determination just grabs you, and Felisin, whose heartbreaking transformation hits you right in the feels. Then there's my favorite, Kalam - he's this enigmatic, deadly assassin but with such a depth of character, he feels real. He's got this tough exterior, but underneath, there's a sense of loyalty and a quest for justice that makes you root for him. Even characters like Coltaine, who could've been just another tough, distant military guy, are way more layered and interesting than you'd expect. Erikson's characters might not all be likable, but wow, do they pull you into their stories. They bring this epic tale down to earth, making it personal. So, they're not just characters in a fantasy book; they feel like real people trying to make it through a seriously brutal world.Kalam Mekhar“What makes a Malazan soldier so dangerous? They’re allowed to think”Writing Style: 4/5Erikson's prose continues to be a standout. It's dense, lyrical, and often philosophical, offering profound insights into the nature of power, war, and human nature. His world-building is second to none, effortlessly combining elements of fantasy, history, and anthropology to create a unique and immersive universe.Despite these strengths, the pacing can be uneven. Some storylines move at a brisk pace, while others seem to drag. The book also tends to lean heavily into grimdark territory, which may not be to everyone's taste. While I personally don't mind it, I'm sure some readers would also find the relentless brutality and cynicism exhausting - it certainly feels like the narrative is wallowing in its own misery sometimes.“We are all lone souls. It pays to know humility, lest the delusion of control, of mastery, overwhelms. And, indeed, we seem a species prone to that delusion, again and ever again.”World Building: 5/5Now, let's talk about the world-building in ""Deadhouse Gates"". Man, is it something to behold. Erikson doesn't just create a world; he constructs an entire universe, overflowing with rich history, diverse cultures, and mystical elements that blow your mind. This book whisks us away from the familiar setting of the first installment and drops us onto a whole new continent with its own unique problems and tensions. It's like stepping into a whole new world within an already massive one. The attention to detail is crazy—you've got distinct societies, religions, even different systems of magic. But what really gets me is how Erikson weaves all these intricate details together to create a world that feels alive, chaotic, and just as messed up as our own.“It is one thing to lead by example with half a dozen soldiers at your back. It is wholly another with ten thousand.”Enjoyment: 3/5There's no denying that it's an impressive book. Erikson's creativity and the sheer magnitude of his world-building had me marveling at the page. Characters like Kalam, who became my favorite, and the memorable Chain of Dogs storyline, added an engaging depth to the narrative. It's a rollercoaster of a read with moments of genuine awe and heartache. But, it's also a tricky beast. The complexity, while impressive, often felt overwhelming, pulling me out of the story just when I was starting to get into it. I found myself working harder than I'd have liked to keep track of everything. So while there were parts I really enjoyed, the effort required to fully appreciate this intricate tapestry took a toll on my overall enjoyment. It's a book that's rewarding to those willing to commit, but be prepared for the hefty challenge it presents. All said, ""Deadhouse Gates"" is an intriguing but demanding read that delivers a satisfying payoff, even if getting there can be a bit of a slog.I'll definitely continue with the series, but I'm hoping that the next book (which appears to be the highest rated book of the series) will at least continue with one of the existing storylines and not jump to some different third continent.Final Rating: 3.6/5🌕🌕🌕🌕🌗My favourite books of 2023 in preferential order🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕:1.The Shadow of the Gods-(My Review)2.The Grace of Kings-(My Review)3.The Lies of Locke Lamora4.The Forgetting Moon-(My Review)5.The Justice of Kings-(My Review)6.Kings of the Wyld-(My Review)🌕🌕🌕🌕🌗:7.Morning Star-(My Review)8.The Blade Itself-(My Review)9.Red Seas Under Red Skies-(My Review)10.The Escape Artist: The Man Who Broke Out of Auschwitz to Warn the World11.Empire of the Vampire-(My Review)12.Assassin's Apprentice-(My Review)13.Golden Son🌕🌕🌕🌕🌑:14.Leviathan Wakes-(My Review)15.The Winter King-(My Review)16.Gardens of the Moon-(My Review)🌕🌕🌕🌗🌑:17.Deadhouse Gates-(My Review)🌕🌕🌕🌑🌑:18.The Song of Achilles-(My Review)19.Red Sister-(My Review)🌕🌕🌑🌑🌑:20.Babel: An Arcane History-(My Review)",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55401.Deadhouse_Gates,Deadhouse Gates.txt
The Poppy War,"”Children ceased to be children when you put a sword in their hands. When you taught them to fight a war, then you armed them and put them on the front lines, they were not children anymore. They were soldiers.”This book. I mean…THIS BOOK! *sighs deeply and shakes head*There is so much to be said about “The Poppy War” and I’m afraid I won’t even be able to put at least half of my thoughts into decent sentences. Because after finishing this book about a month ago(A MONTH AGO!!!)I still have troubles to sort out all of my feelings and thoughts.“The Poppy War”is a great book but it tackles a lot of serious topics and I guess that’s the reason why my heart always feels kind of heavy when I think about it. Of course there is a war raging in this book but there happen so many other things that it’s almost impossible not to flinch when you reach those final 40%. Think about every atrocity that’s ever happened and you get a good idea about what you’re going to read in this book. There’s genocide, rape, torture, self-harm… and that’s just me naming a few of the triggers that might come your way.”War doesn’t determine who’s right. War determines who remains.”Let me tell you this: The longer you continue the worse it gets and even though this was masterfully done and I loved the world building and all the characters, there is still this strange undercurrent of heavy sadness and dread. Golyn Niis was so tough to read, I still get goose bumps when I think about it. This chapter was so, so, so, so damn hard to get through and I can’t remember the last time I read a book and felt that way. Maybe I never felt that way reading a book before. At least I can’t remember a single book that actually made me feel like this. I swear my stomach turned and I had troubles to breathe. I was feeling nauseous reading a book! Yes, it was that heavy! Everyone who already read the book will know what I’m talking about and to those who didn’t: It’s really as bad as everyone claims it to be! I got plenty of warnings but nothing prepared me for Golyn Niis!”Amateurs obsess over strategy, Irjah had once told their class. Professionals obsess over logistics.”Still, despite this heavy feeling of uneasiness that always overcomes me when I think about “The Poppy War” this book was definitely worth reading! I loved the fantasy elements and the idea of powers from the gods! Plus I really enjoyed the chapters at Sinegard Academy and the chimei! What I loved the most was the representation of human nature though. I might be alone with this but it’s obvious that R.F. Kuang put a lot of effort into her characters and you could see it in the way they grow, develop and change. Their character arcs were so amazing to follow, I’m in awe! And before I continue to gush about them here, I might as well move to my character section instead. ;-PThe characters:This is my spoilery spoiler section and if you didn’t read the book already you better turn around and leave. If you’re still curious and don’t want to heed my warning you may proceed at your own risk! I mean I warned you, right? ;-PRin:”No – they couldn’t just do this to her. They might think they could sweep her away like rubbish, but she didn’t have to lie down and take it. She had come from nothing. She wasn’t going back to nothing.”Oh gods! Rin! I can’t believe what she did in the end and I can’t wrap my head around the fact that such a sweet and innocent girl could change that much! But it still happened and her descent was so heavy to watch. >_< I guess that’s what happens when you play with fire, quite literally in her case. She got addicted to the power and I’m so damn afraid of what she’s going to do next! I loved her defiance and strength at the beginning of the book, how she wanted to learn and did everything possible to achieve her goal. She was so determined and strong-willed! But then the war began and all those things happened and with every chapter Rin changed! She became something different, she hardened her heart, she lost her moral compass and made decisions that got her deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole! And then she did the unthinkable and I’m not sure if she’ll ever be able to return from that darkness again. T_T The ending broke my heart, for Rin, for the person she could have been for everything sheHADbeen before she came to Sinegard. She’s not the person she used to be and I find myself weeping for everything she lost and for what she became. =(((”She didn’t want to be possessed. She wanted to remain free.””Then I will die on my feet,” she said. “I will die with flames in my hand and fury in my heart.””My god didn’t make me do anything,” she said. “The gods can’t make our choices for us. They can only offer their power, and we can wield it. And I did, and this is what I chose.” She swallowed. “I don’t regret it.””She was sane, she was convinced of it. She was whole. She had lost much, yes, but she still had her own mind. She made her decisions. She chose to accept the Phoenix. She chose to let it invade her mind.”Altan:”We’re the final front,” said Altan. “If we fail, this country’s lost.” He clapped her on the shoulder. “Excited?”Altan broke my heart. At first I had the same impression like everyone else: That he knows what he’s doing, that he’s in control and a perfect student/soldier but the more we got to see from him, the more it became obvious that he’s far from all those things! This boy was broken beyond repair and he hid it so well that no one ever noticed until it was too late! I can’t say that I liked his actions but I could understand why he acted the way he did! He was lashing out at everyone because he was like a wild animal that only saw threats and didn’t know how to react to kindness. Altan was unable to see that not everyone who confronted him wanted to do him harm. Which makes me sad on so many levels. =( That poor, poor boy! To be tortured like this, to get out of it alive, to live with his past and the knowledge that it might happen again. Just to live with everything he went through! To draw breath every day and to continue, to keep on moving! I can’t even begin to comprehend how he must have felt and I can’t put into words how strongly I feel for him. T_T And I don’t want to believe that he’s dead! He can’t be dead! >_<”I don’t know,” he said after a long moment. “I don’t know what I’m doing.””Altan’s fire drew as its source an unending hate. It was a deep, slow burn. She could almost taste it, the venomous intent, the ancient misery, and it horrified her.How could one person hate so much?What had happened to him?Kitay:”One urinating statue for my easily entertained friend.”Rin blushed. “Kitay, I can’t.”“It costs nothing.”“It costs a lot to me,” she said.Kitay placed the statue in her hand. “If you say one more thing about money, I’m leaving you to get lost.”I absolutely adored Kitay! He’s such a good friend and I loved that Rin and he became besties. =) Despite being fortunate enough to be one of the rich kids at Sinegard Academy he still reached out to her and became her friend. I think that’s what I loved about him the most, he didn’t care about titles or money, he just cared about the person and what it could do! Kitay is the living and breathing proof that good people exist and in the end his character was the only one that gave me any hope. Because despite all the things he witnessed and regardless of everything that happened to him, he still had moral values and acted according to them. In a world so harsh and cruel that it changed everyone around him, he still held on to his convictions and I loved him for it! <333”There was a hard glint to his eyes that she had never seen in him before. He looked as if he had aged five years. He looked like his father. He was like a sword that had been sharpened, metal that had been tempered.”Jiang:”I am a mortal who has woken up, and there is power in awareness.”I really don’t know how to feel about Jiang! I actually liked him at the beginning of the book but I was so disappointed by him when it ended. His character was some sort of catalyst and I had the distinct feeling that he could have done more, that he SHOUD HAVE done more! What if he would have taught Rin about her powers? What if he would have allowed her to use them in a safe setting? What if he would have fought alongside them and would have helped her to control the phoenix? He basically left Altan and Rin to their own devices and this set them on the dark path they were descending at the end. How different everything could have gone if Jiang would have watched out for them! =( To drop Altan as his student was the first mistake he made and not to teach Rin properly apparently his last.”Ah. The law.” Jiang sniffed at an unidentified leaf and then tossed it away. “So inconvenient. So irrelevant.”The relationships & ships:Rin & Altan:”She knew what addiction looked like. Opium smokers were yellowed, useless sacks of flesh. They did not fight like Altan did. They did not move like Altan did. They were not perfect, lethal animals of graceful beauty.”Okay, I’m going to say it:I DIDN’T SHIP RIN AND ALTAN!I’m sorry but I just couldn’t! They didn’t have much of a relationship before Rin joined the Cike and once she was a part of them her relationship with Altan was nothing but abusive. He slapped her, hurt her with words, forced her to do things she didn’t want to do and was everything else but supportive. How was I supposed to ship that? I get that Altan was thoroughly broken but he didn’t have to let it out on Rin and as frustrated as he might have been with her, he still had no right to hurt her. So nope, it was clear right from the beginning that he didn’t respect her as much as she respected him and if you ask me those two never had a future. (Not saying that I wouldn’t love for Altan to come back again. I still wouldn’t ship him with Rin though) I’ll never ship those two and I stand by it. Fight me! *lol* ;-P”Hey. Hey.”Cool fingers wrapped around her wrists. Gently, Altan pulled her hands away from her face. She looked up and met his eyes. They were a shade of crimson brighter than poppy petals.“It’s okay,” he said. “I know. I know what it’s like. I’m going to help you.””She had adored an idea of him, an archetype, a version of him that was invulnerable. But now she knew the truth, she knew the realness of Altan and his vulnerabilities and most of all his pain… and still she loved him.”He leaned forward and grasped her face in both hands. She thought for a bizarre moment that he was going to kiss her. He didn’t. He pressed his forehead against hers for a long time. She closed her eyes. She drank in the sensation of her skin against his. She seared it into her memory.”Rin & Nezha:”We aren’t here to be sophisticated. We’re here to fuck people up.”Now that’s a relationship I could appreciate! Yes, Nezha was an ass at the beginning of the book but in contrast to Altan he actually realized his faults and apologized to Rin. I loved how they both grew out of their initial animosity and became friends in the end. And those fighting scenes!! They were pure harmony on the battlefield and anyone who claims differently didn’t read the book! XD Just like Kitay seemed to have become a moral compass for Rin the same could be said for Nezha and I’m sure if he’d been around at the end she wouldn’t have gone down that dark road. >_< Unfortunately Nezha was lost in the toxic mist and seems to be dead. I refuse to believe that he’s gone for good though. I mean he had some serious healing abilities so maybe he survived it and became a prisoner? But then again he most likely would have been with the Mugenese when Rin launched her attack and I don’t know if he would have been able to survive this as well. >_< I really hope Nezha will magically reappear in the second book! =)”But I saved your life. Doesn’t that make us at least a little square?”Square? Square? She had to laugh. “You almost got me expelled!”“And you almost killed me,” he said. That shut her up.“I was scared of you,” Nezha continued. “And I lashed out. I was stupid. I was a spoiled brat. I was a real pain in the ass. I thought I was better than you, and I’m not. I’m sorry.”Altan & Chaghan:”They had come to an understanding, she and Chaghan. They were no longer opposed, vying for Altan’s favor. They were allies, now, bound by the mutual atrocities they had commited.”I’m going to be honest here: I’m such a sucker for Chaghan!!! I love his character!!!! And is it just me or did I actually feel some gay vibes between those two?! Altan and Chaghan definitely had more chemistry than Rin and Altan ever had! *lol* And they didn’t even have all too many scenes together! I got the distinct feeling that something happened when they spent those three days in the valleys and I’m not talking about Altan winning a fight between them, feel me? *wriggles eyebrows* Haha! ;-P Gosh, I really would have loved to find out more about their relationship and this is just one more reason why Altan can’t be dead! I just ship him and Chaghan too much to accept his death! Period! XDConclusion:“The Poppy War”was an amazing and sometimes truly revolting dark tale about a young girl that follows her own path and fights for what she thinks is right. It shows us how people can grow and how their circumstances and perceptions can change them. For better or for worse… This tale isn’t over yet. In fact it just began and I can’t wait to read what’s going to happen next. Let’s continue to hope for the best while we expect the worst, because apparently that’s the only attitude that will get you through this series. ;-)”And she would call the gods to do such terrible things.”",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35068705-the-poppy-war,The Poppy War.txt
The Emperor's Blades,"Alright I want to get some minor quibbles out of the way before I go into a detailed analysis of the major problems I had with this book and a lot of grimdark in general.- Book is slow and boring. One storyline dominates the others. I dreaded picking it up.- Author hates fat people and small eyes. It was a weird compulsive quirk! He also had a serious case of Disney Eyes in regard to “good” characters.- Considering this is meant to be morally grey “grimdark” fantasy there are clearly drawn lines between the “good” and “bad” guys.But what I really want to speak about is the representations of women inBladesparticularly, and grimdark fantasy generally. I’m also going to touch on how the book handles POC and LGBTQ characters.Bitches and WhoresI had so many problems with the way this book handled female characters. I’m going to highlight a few examples. These aren’t meant to be all- encompassing but they do providetextual evidencefor my complaints. I want to be really clear that I’m not just talking about characterization. I’m talking about unconscious bias in the writing that routinely reveals itself in the way female characters relate to one another and the world, and in how they are internally described by POV characters. I’m also talking about the amount of time they get on the page, and the way their character arcs are handled. These are separate issues from just “the story”. It was these aspects of the writing that rankled me the most.Physical DescriptionsWomen are described by their breasts, physical attractiveness and Disney eyes. I wouldn’t mind this if men were likewise described but the only men who get detailed descriptions are the “fat, disgusting” ones. In Valyn’s first scene, surrounded by blood, gore and murder victims and in the middle of a training exercise Valyn spends time monologueing about how sexy Lin is. A few chapters later here is how Valyn describes Gwenna:“… tempted by the bright green eyes and flaming red hair, by the supple, curvaceous body that she did her best to hide…”Argh! It is gratuitous and constant.Their personalities are also problematic. Girls are either dangerous like Gwenna with her terrible temper, or pathetic, like Rianne, or hopelessly inept like Lin and Adare.CharacterisationAdareAdare is one of the siblings but is only given about 6 chapters in the whole novel. She is constantly compared to others and her difficultly as a women in a man’s world is obsessed over. The author sets up a hyper-sexist world.“It is no slight to you, Baxter Pane had argued, staring at her with those rheumy eyes of his, (eye obsession strikes again!) but women are not suited to the Ministry. They are too … fickle, too easily transported by their emotions.”Ok, I can understand that. But then he unconsciously characterised her in sexist way that confirms the bias.She bit into a fingernail, then remembered her post, the hundreds watching, and returned the hand forcefully to her lap. Adare let the words trail off, retaking her seat with as much dignity as she could muster. Adare swallowed a curse. And here I am, allowing myself to be transported by my emotions.She pretty much confirms all the criticisms and concerns people have about her and I'm not even sure the author realises this.LinI have a real issue withlove interests who are sexually assaulted and then fridged to provide impetus for a male POV character. It is so disrespectful.Consider this scenario:Your brave hero is a warrior. She comes home to discover her loving husband has been raped and killed by her enemy. Furious and grief stricken she swears to punish the people who did this to her husband. And if she flirts with a few sexy young men along the way, well that doesn’t diminish her cause, a girl has needs you know…Or how bout this one:Your James Bond stand- in is captured by the enemy. He is ruthlessly tortured and raped until he manages to escape. He swears vengeance. He will bring forth unholy terror on the people who hurt him. But to succeed he will need the help of a sexy female friend. Can he learn to love again? Can he trust her to touch his body with kindness after suffering with this isolating trauma for so long?Do you find these laughable? Possibly offensive? How would you have felt if the scenario inBladeshad looked like this:“I should be focusing on my bladework, and all I can think about is ripping the pants off this boy.”Yurl had straddled Valyn, and instead of ending the struggle with a blow to the back of the neck, he was reaching down between his legs, trying to force his thighs apart as he thrashed and writhed.”Would you be defending “realism” and the need to “set the tone” if the male protagonist was casually sexually assaulted while everyone- trainers, friends and fellow students- looked on, jeering when Yurl managed to wrap a hand around Valyn’s limp dick or rub a few fingers along his crack?If you are uncomfortable with the image I’m painting you need to ask yourself why you were ok with Staveley doing it to Lin.AmieAnd that brings me to another thing- the murdered prostitute Amie. When Lin criticizes another character for soliciting sex from a thirteen year old girl she is shamed. I'm including the lot so no one can argue I've ignored context.The smile froze on Laith’s face. “She wasn’t my whore.”“Of course not. That’s the nice thing about borrowed gear—if it gets busted, it’s no skin off your nose. If Amie had been yours, maybe you would have taken better care of her.”Valyn raised a hand to stop the words, but Laith stepped in close before he could speak. The flier’s normal genial humor had burned off like the oil from the sputtering lamp.“I don’t know how I became the villain in this little tale,” he said, eyes bright, voice soft, “but don’t drag me into your guilt.”“My guilt?” Lin sputtered.“Oh, right,” the flier shot back. “I forgot. You only bought fruit from her. You never bought sex.” He held up his palms in mock surrender. “What’d you pay her? A few copper flames? Enough to put a decent meal on her table? Enough so she could stop whoring?”Lin refused to respond, her face closed like a book.“Before you come pointing your finger at me, why don’t you ask yourself what you did to make Amie’s life any better,” Laith demanded, eyes ablaze. Before Valyn could say anything to calm things down, the flier turned on his heel and stalked out.What is so strange about this is that the author seems to be making the suggestion that these two things aresomehow equivalent. Like fucking a 13 year old shows the same degree of concern as purchasing produce from said 13 year old. Even if Lin had done nothing for Amie,she still was dead to rights to call out another character for paying for sex with the 13 year old.What most infuriated me about this was that Lin is left feeling guilty and no one ever questions Laith's position. Somehow he won that round? How???? It is accepted as fair and correct by all the characters and thus I can only conclude that it is also meant to be accepted as such by the reader. What the fuck?POC and LGBTQ charactersBalendin looked like a savage straight out of the Hannan jungles. The feathers of seabirds hung among his long, dark braids, rings of ivory and iron pierced his ears, and blue ink snaked up his arms.“And you wonder why everyone wants to string you bastards up,” Gent grumbled. “No offense meant, Talal, but the whole thing is sick, filthy…”So just a regular POC by fantasy standards then. He is “treacherous” and “frightening”. He is a filthy savage. He is also a magical savage who probably should have been lynched. The POV characters also make much of his background. He is from a colonized backwater, possibly one of the ones,“pressing back against the ‘foreign oppressors,’ never mind that our oppression is what brings law courts and foreign trade, military protection and technological advancement”.I mean... for fucks sake... how many times do we have to keep talking about how shitty it is to constantly frame fantasy stories in terms of colonization and marginalization? The three POV characters are obviously from an extremely privelegded background so I’m not saying they should have better awareness of their own place in society but the novel never challenges these perspectives.These sort of comments are just thrown out into the narrative to swim around unchallenged.It makes it really hard to understand what Staveley’s intentions are because in his own words he seems to think it is really easy to break tropes, and that he is more interested in exploring traditional frameworks. Consider his understanding of what fantasy tropes are:“Within the fantasy genre, however, breakage is actually pretty easy. See that nice wizard over there? He has a pointy hat and a white beard. He mutters querulously to himself. He’s forgetful. He likes to read. He feeds nuts to an owl that perches on his shoulder. Now, let’s watch as he pries the eyeball from the skull of an innocent child while that child’s parents, whom our wizard has nailed (non-fatally) to a wall, watch in horror. Trope: broken. Honestly, I’m always a little surprised when people describe my books as dark or violent.”I mean what the hell? In that interview he seemed to be giving himself a pat on the back for his trope-breaking plot points. This suggests he isn’t aware of the tropes he is reinforcing- which also means that even if he manages to redeem some aspects of his story in the next two books- it will likely be as accidental and unconscious as his reinforcement of them was in this novel.I’m not even going to deal with Annick the magical unicorn lesbian. Suffice to say Staveley isn’t providing any nuance to that aspect of characterization either.I can handle books that deal with difficult issues or exist in grimdark universes.But if you are going to explore issues of gender, sexual assault, and colonization at least do it with conscious fucking awareness.I was so angry reading this book. The issues were so overt that it would have been impossible for me to enjoy this even if the story had been more engaging/ better paced.This is the end of the review. The other stuff deals with grimdark fantasy more generally.Some criticisms I suspect this review will garner after my experience with a similar critique I did ofAxe and the Throne:“This is grimdark, if you can’t handle the genre don’t read it.”Fuck you. I’m not being raped every other day in real life so why the fuck should every god-damn women in grimdark fantasy? If this is so fucking inevitable to the genre why doesBest Served Coldmanage to incorporate fully fleshed out female characters without constantly resorting to gendered violence. Why isJoe Abercrombieable to have a character who is a loving, single parent and a vicious torturer? Why is he able to have a female character that fucks and chucks a bloke and ends up better off for it?“Grimdark is just being honest. This is reality.”Grimdark is a subgenre that describes a particular the tone, style or setting of speculative fiction (especially fantasy) that is, depending on the definition used, markedly dystopian or amoral, or particularly violent or realistic.Here’s the thing- grimdark does not have to equal sexism. N.K. Jemison’s Broken Earth series (The Fifth Season) is dystopian, amoral, violent and realistic. However, shockingly, characters don’t suffer because they are women or because they are POC.It is possible to write a grim dark novel and include harrowing, realistic scenes without resorting automatically to gendered and racial violence.When you say, “well this is realistic” or “this is historically accurate” you are saying that realistic worldbuilding requires the inclusion of certain specific inequalities in order to count as realistic –that a story cannot be honest, or characters believably human, if women and POC aren’t oppressed or villainous. You are assuming that current expressions of bigotry, sexism and racism are universal truths.You are saying that there is no other possible reality that could be believable and then wonder why we get pissed off. Novels likeBladesreinforce specific inequalities as inevitable, thereby further perpetuating those perspectives.The thing isgrimdark doesn’t accurately reflect the historical period it is trying to mimic or even current reality. Where is the male rape? Where are the soldiers dying, not in an epic battle, but from infected scratches? Where are the people going insane from syphilis, which hero has a dick full of pus as a result of his philandering? Why aren’t the sexually active women pregnant? Why can so many characters read? I think you understand what I am getting at.The real problem is that grimdark as a genre has developed anaestheticthat readers have become familiar with. As a result itfeels realistic and right. Hardboiled pulp noir mysteries felt realistic in the 1950’s but we look back on them now and see them as a product of the author's time period, not as an accurate depiction of any sort of reality. The same is true for grimdark. It appeals to modern cynicism and we are so used to seeing gendered violence and oppressed POC that we think this is realistic. But it isn’t. And I strenuously reject any claims to the contrary.“The real world is not the same as a fictional world, authors shouldn’t have to be PC, fuck you and all the other SJW’s out to ruin everything.”Firstly, why are you so invested in seeing women raped and POC victimised in your fiction? I think this says more about you then me.Secondly, fiction has real- world consequences. Negative and positive.The Birth of a Nationinspired the formation of the second era of the Klu Klux Klan.12 Years a Slaveand other true accounts were essential in the political fight against slavery.Fiction is not created or read in a vacuum.It is no coincidence that the MRA movement evolved out of the gaming community. There is a reason women read and write “feminist” fiction.On one level or another we all acknowledge the very real and important ways stories permeate and shape our experience of the world.That said this is a subjective review. No one is preventing Staveley from publishing his work or you from reading it. I can say I don't like it and his fans can keep reading it. My dislike for something does not prevent you from enjoying it. I'm not lurking behind Staveley's writing desk with a butcher's knife telling him to write better fiction…or else…“Not every woman has to be a superhero who rescues kitties and knows karate.”Yep. I’m well- aware of that, thanks.Women do not have to fall into a handful of archetypes. They do not have to be the hero every time or to always succeed. A Mary Sue is just as infuriating as a trophy vagina.What is necessary is that female characters are as multi-faceted and flawed as male characters.They need to have their own motivations and goals. If they suffer it should be part of their character arc not their love interests.Lin was not a real person. Every decision she made aimed at pushing Valyn along his path to character growth. Consider that in one scene she ruthlessly kills a girl to teach Valyn the importance of recognizing the greater good. A few scenes later she teaches him the importance of compassion. Lin loses her temper, which leads him to play the hero and also teaches him the lesson that he should not let his emotions rule him. It also helps inspire sympathy in the reader for Valyn and increases our desire to see him succeed over the assholes.I don’t think it is too much to ask of authors that they ensure their female characters are fully-fleshed out.“Later in the series xyz character does xyz which proves it’s not sexist at all.”Firstly, the other books don’t matter because I’m reviewing this book.Secondly, from some of the synopsis’ I’ve read of the other books I’m almost certain I would have similar complaints.Thirdly, in terms of literary merit, I found the book boring and have no interest in reading the rest of the series.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17910124-the-emperor-s-blades,The Emperor's Blades.txt
Words of Radiance,"This is it. The review no one was waiting for. First thing I must say, I have never given any book 5 stars. Because that would mean it is perfect. And that's a tall order. But I couldn't give it any less. Because it was phenomenal. Like ""holy shit"" amazing. On to the review. Needless to say...spoilers ho!The book was too large (not complaining) and there were too many insane parts (definitely not complaining) to do a blow by blow for each character. So I'll stick with the best five. Since it was obviously Shallans book, we will start with her.5. Mapping the shattered plains on the flyThis was a pure scholar moment. One where every neurone lines up and the answer screams at you. SYMMETRY!! And who would've thought the inspiration would come from an assassin that almost killed her. So there goes my theory that something landed in the centre and ""shattered"" the plains. But alas it's merely another geometrically perfect natural occurrence that is so common place on Roshar. Either way, proving every single scholar wrong in the space of 5 heartbeats...Jasnah will be proud. She basically walked in, said her piece, dropped the mic and walked off. Great moment.4.""How do you poop?""Not only was this a hilarious moment. But it was a damn good question at the perfect moment. Adolin is doing what he does. Playing the brave soldier, impressing the ladies and everything is going as usual. And then Shallan throws him a curveball. She knew what she was supposed to ask but this was the man who she'll be spending her life with (supposedly). So she shows her true self. And in my own humble opinion, because it is my review after all, that is the moment where Adolin begins to fall in love with her. Aww3. Kaladins bootsAnother great moment for her. We all know she's not one for confrontation or lying. And when she does both it's gonna be damn good. The whole part where she meets up with the con artist was interesting. I wasn't a fan of her influence over Shallan because I could see this leading to losing her Radiance but she stayed cool and used her lessons for good. And by ""good"" I mean petty larceny. Then she killed and avenged her former teacher. Stay classy Shallan.2. Becoming a spyBourne Identity mixed with high fantasy. Learning espionage from herself and working for the Ghost Bloods to accomplish her own aims. You have to respect that. Have to respect her. Also what the hell is the deal with MaskFace? The way Shallan had her committed was genius. Now she's a member and things are only going to get more convoluted. And that just makes me salivate.1. Finding UrithiruThe mythical city. The focus of Jasnah's research. Some guy walked there but you can't find it? Kind of a slap to the face. So much work was put into hunting down the last repository of untainted knowledge of the Desolations. And she did. Centre of the Plains, Shallan manages to find the key to the portal to the secret city and saves the army from destruction. All. By. Her. Self. Number 1 moment indeed.Because it was a whole thing. The build up from book 1. Realising that they're buildings not rocks. Realising the Shardblade was the key to opening the portal. And realising a few other things I've probably forgotten. It was the culmination of a journey she started as a child. And it was perfect.In Way of Kings, Shallan was an interesting character. A nice read but nothing special. That all changed here. A depth was added to her as the deepest darkest secrets of her life were laid bare. And the true measure of her strength was made known.Dalinar was as always the Blackthorn. A great man and a true soldier. After everything he has been through and has accomplished there is no one who will ever compare to him. His top five? Let's find out.5. ""Where is our honour?""This wasn't a big bit of his but it was important. It was the moment he truly realised how far men had fallen. It was the moment he realised that the head of his Knights Radiant was a little bitch. Trying to jump in and save his sons sans plate and blade was pure Blackthorn. Noble and brave and suicidal. The right course of action was clear to him. Had it been anyone else, Dalinar STILL would have tried to help. But no one else would have. You've got a lot of work to do Blackthorn.4. Admitting his visionsAs Wit said, this was a powerful move. Standard psychological tactics. Embrace your weakness and make it your strength. And what a place to do it. Kings feast. One giant Shardplated middle finger to the whole of Alethi royalty. Like. A. Boss. Once again a moment where he shows himself above the games and pettiness. The only adult amongst children. He raises the bar and invites people to join him.3. Banishing AmaramThis wasn't what we wanted to see but it will suffice for now. Amaram. Acting like he didn't slaughter the entirety of Kaladins squad just for a fancy piece of metal. The look on his face at the duel when he realised who Kaladin was? Priceless. Then denying it and blaming Kaladin? What a dick. Didn't work did it you douche? Dalinar figured you out. And banished your ass. That was a big moment. Kal prepared to apologise for Dalinars sake. Dalinar prepared to alienate an old friend because Kaladin was right. Heartwarming as hell. And it wasn't just an afterthought. Oh no. He set a trap!Let's focus on that for a moment. The Blackthorn. A warrior. Despiser of politics and intrigue. Set a trap! Is there anything he can't do? No. Moment over.2. Leading a force against the ParshendiDoes he have any idea where they are?Does he have any idea how long he'll be gone for?Does he have any idea what kind of forces they have?Does he fuck. But he doesn't need to know because he is the Blackthorn. Bold move. Risking the Highstorms and striking out at the heart of the Parshendi. Fulfil the Vengeance Pact once and for all. A move that would either see him rise to the top of Alethkar, or see his body fall beneath it. Yet he didn't do it for the potential gain. He did it simply because it needed to be done. Deal with the Parshendi before the desolation comes. Working with few resources against a deadline. A necessary move to give them the best chance of victory. Didn't quite work out as expected. But he did what he could. And that is why he was chosen to recreate the Knights.1. Bonding with the StormfatherThis was, without a doubt, an amazing moment. The Stormfather himself. The legend of the whole world. Wherever the Highstorm lands, the Stormfather is known. Charged by Honour himself to pass on the message. He hates humanity. He despises their weakness. And what does Dalinar do to this most widely know of spren? Binds him to his side in a moment that will never be forgotten. No fanfare or anything, just business. Dalinar...I salute you.Now that we know the fates of the past spren, we know that this has never been done before. Never in all the Desolations before has anyone bonded with the Stormfather. Now the last Desolation is here and the Blackthorn will wield the Stormfather against the Voidbringers to reclaim the Tranquiline Halls.Adolin. Such a great guy. Always trying to do the right thing. Defend his father, his brother, his aunt, his king and his girl (whoever it may be at the time). Now for his best moments.5. Cologne? In prison?The fact that Adolin imprisoned himself in protest of Kaladins punishment was amazing. Yeah we've always known he was a good guy. But this? Kaladin threw himself into a Shard duel with nothing but a spear. And earned Adolin's loyalty. He couldn't overrule the king, obviously, but he did the next best thing. The son of a Highprince. In prison. For a Bridgeman. The honour is boundless. Yeah he bathed. So what? He's not an animal.4. IronstanceThis refers to his first duel of the book. When he decided to stop playing games. These cretins were discrediting his family, his father and his house. And Adolin showed him what happens when you do something so stupid. You get a battering. This was a no mercy moment and it was fantastic. You could see Adolin accept the responsibility of guarding his family. Standing up to take the weight on his shoulders. The maturing moment. Love it.3. Final battle.This was a great moment. Not the greatest. But still awesome. Leading a battalion against the first Voidbringers of the Last Desolation? Too good. The entire charge was amazing. Going toe to toe with Stormform while the weather goes batshit crazy is a hell of a feat. AND THEN he manages to sneak a thousand guys round the back of the enemies line and single handedly stops them finishing their devil song. And while he's at it he kills their only Shardbearer. All in a days work. *Brushes off shoulder*2. Killing that rat bastard SadeasWe all wanted it. We all dreamed of doing it. No one cried. Everyone cheered. When Adolin wrapped his hands around Sadeas' neck and squeezed, we all went crazy. Parades were thrown and champagne flowed down the street. After what he did we all wanted him dead. Preferably at Dalinar or Kaladins hands. But given their new Radiant status it wasn't gonna happen. Enter Adolin. While I approve its gonna spell problems between him and Shallan especially since she is also a Radiant. Drama! But still, glad he killed him.What I don't quite get is how Sadeas was that unstable. The Radiants have returned, Everstorm has returned and he is standing in the lost city of Urithiru. And he still wants to steal Dalinars power and position. Idiot.1. 4 on 1 duel.For me this was the greatest of all. A duel between Shardbearers is an awe inspiring thing. Then when Adolin proposed a 2 on 1 it was a thing of beauty. We were all waiting for the craziness to begin. Then it did. 4 fully armed and armoured warriors standing in front of Adolin. And we lost our shit. I still remember Zahels words ""they're afraid of you...show them why"". And he did.That was the best thing. The honour! The courage! Anyone would have conceded the fight. It would have been the obvious thing to do. The smart thing. But not the right thing.Attacking like the Whitespine, he showed no mercy and gave no quarter. And he held his own. For a while at least. Let's be honest, with those odds we all expected him to die but he survived. And won. Yes it was a group effort. Kaladin fought like a mad man and Renarin...was there. All in all. Adolin's best scene.Kaladin...is Kaladin. Need I say more? No. I don't.5. Riding the RyshadiumThis was a really subtle scene. First of all I'd like to point out that one of the greatest warriors alive can't ride a horse. Does that not seem odd? I thought he was of a high enough nahn to get riding lessons but I guess not. Back to the scene. Despite the fact he had only started riding horses about an hour earlier he STILL went and rode the Ryshadium. Well, he tried anyway. But the biggest thing was that he laughed. Genuinely. For a few moments everything was forgotten and there was a simple joy in his life. And for THAT I have made this a top five scene. Because even the greatest need to laugh every once in a while.4. First flightWe all remember him practicing in the plains. Lashing himself from side to side. Jumping around like a monkey on meth. And then he did it. That which we have all been waiting for since we realised its possible. He lashed himself upwards. And he flew!! Oh my days was it amazing! Rising into the sky. Ascending unto the heavens. Perhaps I'm reading too much into this but it was superb. Soaring through the clouds with Syl and a whole group of wind spren. He was free of the shackles of gravity and understood that the limits of his power were of his own creation.3. Killing the ChasmfiendThis was a hell of a fight. Two Knights versus one Chasmfiend. I can't be sure but I believe that the Chasmfiend was actually Voidspren possessed. A few choice moments during the fight, like the intelligence in its eyes and the red spren leaving it's body after. But that's later. Being hunted by a Chasmfiend through the cracks in the plains was amazing. The sheer desperation of the chase was exhilarating. The way Kaladin killed it was superb. Sword to the brain. From inside the mouth. Chasmfiend steaks for all!2. ""Honour is dead""This was without a doubt an amazing moment. A surreal moment. Surreal in that I actually believed I was on Roshar watching this duel happen, and I STILL didn't believe it was happening. This scene has made it into the top 5 of 3/4 of the main characters. And even though Shallan was there it was Pattern that did the work. Plus she had better bits.Leaping into an arena full of Shardblades is an act of supreme insanity. Unless you are Kaladin Stormblessed. With nothing more than a spear he leapt into a battle where each man counts as a hundred. But he is no man. He is a Knight. Weaving around strike after strike, he fought incredibly. A force of nature, long forgotten, now returned. Drawing Stormlight from his own reserves and the fractured plate itself.Now let's be clear on one thing. He was there as support. He was there to distract one or two while Adolin beat the others. That doesn't lessen his actions. Throughout this book he has been wavering between what he wants to do and what he should do. But when push comes to shove, he knows the right thing and he does it with no hesitation.1. Resurrecting his OathThis was an emotional bit. Sounds weird but it was. Just to be clear the number one Kaladin moment stretches from ""Elhokar was Dalinars Tien"" all the way to the renewal of his Radiance.The revelation. He's injured. Weak, both physically and emotionally. And it's raining. Which is so very important. Tien would always cheer his big brother up during the rains. So in his vulnerable state it's no shock that he would think back to how his brother died. How Kaladin failed Tien. The guilt was weighing so heavily. His spirit close to breaking as he tried to justify killing Elhokar. Then the words come. Not the Radiant oaths but these were arguably more important. The words he uses to justify killing the king were the same ones that turned the lifeless body of his innocent little brother into a military strategy. And for the first time in a while, Kaladin was back. He realised that he cannot be that man who decides who to save and who to condemn. Then he realises that Dalinar loves his nephew like Kaladin loved Tien. And after that...nothing more need be realised.Charging up to the palace. Injured and weak. All to save a man he despises. Uses a spear to take out two armoured guards. Finds Elhokar drunk and unconscious. Manages to rouse him and runs straight into Moash. Wearing the plate Kaladin gave him. What a dick.In Moash's defense, tenuous though it is, he did try to get Kaladin to stand down. As far as Moash knows, nothing's changed. But everything has changed (Taylor Swift song. Good song). The battering Kaladin receives at the hands of those two is simply brutal. Add that to his pre-existing injuries and you wonder what is keeping this mans heart beating. Moash wonders the same when in awe he asks ""Kal, how are you standing?""The answer? He sees himself clearly. Truly. The pain burns the falsities away and Kaladin knows who he wants to be. A true protector. Syl and Stormfather arguing over him. She claims him. Say the words Kaladin. Stretch forth thy hand.""I protect even those I hate so long as it is right""There are no words to convey how insane I went at this point. My kindle was set down while I cheered silently but hysterically. Holy shit! He led us on such a ride. Even to the point of losing Syl. But he pulled through. He became a knight in truth.And so concludes the top five for the main four. What follows are writings on minor characters.Szeth. Ah man I feel so sorry for the guy. Lied to by his people and forced to become a murderer. His gentle nature broken by the weight of so many innocent lives. All because the Shin didn't want to admit that maybe things were about to get bad. Not only did they bury their heads in the sand but they decapitated the one guy who didn't. DicksHis duels with Kaladin were amazing. Not only because it was Radiant vs Radiant but because they finally showed him the truth. That he was right all along. Also Kaladin healing his dead arm? The implications are staggering.It was also good because that was probably the first assassination attempt where he failed to kill anyone. Ok on the plains not so much. The way he tried to kill Dalinar? Lashing him upwards just enough to ascend? That was amazing! True it might be my inner psycho talking but come on! And then it ends by him being resurrected to join the Knights Radiant as internal affairs. With Nightblood. Because that's gonna end well.Tarovingian is a hell of a mystery. A fluctuating intelligence level? Obviously a gift from that Nightwatcher. Who I maintain is a splinter of Cultivation. But he's basically got a quantum diagram detailing the future and has folk acting on it to guarantee survival. Not victory. Survival. So there's obviously a very large part of the diagram detailing the extinction of humanity.Whilst reading a few questions came to mind:•is the desolation happening because Odium is returning?•if he is returning, why? Honour is already dead and one must assume Cultivation is as well. Why would he kill one threat and leave another?•how is being around Kaladin, awakening the Radiance in his bridge men?•can Kaladin use Stormlight to heal other people?•what does Taln reacting to Shallans magic mean?•how will Alethi society change now that the major players are now in Urithiru?•in the face of another desolation will the Radiants be welcomed?•are the Parshendi the voidbringers or is it the spren that inhabit them?I will admit that my words did not do justice to these fine moments. You want good words? Read the book. Until next time fellow Radiants.May the words be ever on your lips.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17332218-words-of-radiance,Words of Radiance.txt
The Way of Kings,"We have the freedom to express our opinions in beauty of subjectivity, and we should always fight and bite to keep that.But that's not the case I'm trying to make here with this review.I’m not trying to challenge anyone’s opinion or common sense when I say that by all measures of literature in history of mankind – and what paved the way for books, movies, songs we today call classics to be considered as such because of their unique quality – The Way of Kings(as well as its far worse sequel: Words of Radiance)is one of the worst books ever written.I tried as much as I could to share my thoughts in a thoughtful and respectful manner for all of you who love this book.And I believe that I do have an actual position (as an admirer of fantasy genre) that I feel obliged to argue.Especially when I see a problem.OK?OK.Onto the actual review, then.The only book I’ve read more times than this one wasLeo Tolstoy’s War and Peace.And the reason why I read War and Peace so many times was because upon each read I discovered something new that would grip me in Leo’s story; a new character and their perspectives I overlooked or experienced in a different way every other time I took the book in my hands.A true masterpiece and a classic that rightfully stands against the time, in spite being written well over a century ago.Am I actually trying to draw a comparison between War and Peace and The Way of Kings?God, no!The only similarity these two books have, luckily, is that both are just that – books.In everything else they fail in comparison.But, I have seen many people calling The Way of Kings both a masterpiece and an instant classic of the genre.I admit, on my first two reads, I was inclined to agree. I understand all of you who think and say that.Because I was one of you. I was enamored and infatuated by scope and magnitude of what I was reading.I never thought that someone could make a story where people are fighting over a heart of a giant crab and make it sound serious.I never thought that you could read about bunch of knights, dressed as medievalPower Rangers,wielding giant swords that were made out of pure essence, which would appear in their hands out of thin air(or morning mist)when they would call them with their minds – and not come out as a dork high on sugar.It was important to me because I was one of those dorks high on sugar.I thought – what most of you are right now quite unimaginatively repeating in unison – that this book was exclusively nothing but: amazing.Now?I’m deeply ashamed of myself for having such a high opinion of this book.So, what happened in-between my first two reads in 2011 and 2012 and this one at the end of 2017?Well, the answer is quite simple:I read better books than this one.Better books with richer worlds, more beautiful prose and far more developed characters.Better series with less inconsistencies in it, less plotholes and less… well, problems overall.Better authors that were more focused on quality of what they were writing about - where you can actually recognize their effort to make a book better;than quantity - when after first two reads and beginners infatuation by the scope and magnitude of what you were dealing with, few years later when you try to reread what you, in your ignorance, were believing was an‘instant classic’,is nothing more than a shallow, 800 pages far too long, rambling.So, the actual rating for this book is 2.25/5.How come exactly 2.25?Well, because of the chart. This one:And the long list of problems that prevented numbers on that chart from going higher.What problems?Let’s start with the biggest one for me.Characterization.The fun starts, with - what I will repeat is - probably one of the best described confusion of battle I have ever read. Anywhere.And whoever experienced a battle in real life, or at least playedCoDonline, or really, really carefully was trying to figure out what baseball is about, probably knows of confusion I’m talking about.(And if you’re wondering, yes, I experienced all three above – baseball is the worst. By far.)It’s a really great scene where you are put in this situation where you don’t have any knowledge of terrain, where you are depraved of‘bird’s perspective’in which you can'see'battle on the east flank, or what happens on the west side, so that you can act accordingly.No, here, all you can see are sweating bodies; hear yelling and cursing; and smell gore and piss.You’re a puppet, you know you’re a puppet, and like one, they move you all around.And in this chapter we are introduced to our main protagonist. OurJesus,ourSupermanof the story.With his almost omnipotent power he’s expressing, he tries to take care of those who can’t do that for themselves, and you can see in his saddened gaze – which is due to undoubtedly his equally sad and tragic past – weight of the entire world, threatening to crash him underneath.Yet he stands.Resolute.Until the next chapter where we see him in shackles, with broken spirit, strolling away as a slave toShattered Plains,where he will carry bridges into war across the chasms, towards revolution and freedom for all!(Now insert a petty sarcasm ""over 6000"" here):Nooo, I haveneverseen a character such as this!It never, ever, crossed my mind thatKaladin(our main protagonist) is a Jesus and Superman in one, withPeter Pan’s Tinkerbelle (Syl)on his shoulders as, not just as a moral compass, but a source of his powers to, let’s say, I don’t know, maybe even fly…And yes, I’m ashamed of this as well, because it took me two reads to realize similarities between Peter Pan and Tinkerbelle and Kaladin and Syl.So, now that we are on Shattered Plains… wow, wow, wow, wow… where are you going?You thought we were moving forward?No, no, no, no, this book doesn’t work like that. No…In order for us to move forward with characterization of our main protagonist, we have to go:back.Into the 800 pages long info-dumps.Oh yes.Oh no!Ramifications of this atrocity called:‘characterization through characters past’will be significant in future.First two books ofThe Stormlight Archiveseries are the most dangerous thing that happened to this genre.In 50 years, when historians will bang their heads in an effort to find roots of a downfall of epic fantasy as a genre, they’ll find its roots here. In this very book.It started already. Just this year alone I have read two books by an author who said he was inspired byBrandon Sanderson.And he did this exact same thing. He build a character by telling his past.And… do you know what some of you who read those books said about that approach of building a character?You called it an info-dump.It’s really interesting how you failed to recognize and you actually praised that same approach here, where that kind of fallacy practically came from. Oh well…Who knows how many of new, aspiring authors will be inspired by this kind of approach.All because none of us told Sanderson thatTHIS - DOESN'T - WORK.‘So what’,you’ll say.‘Surely there’s no a definitive answer what characterization is or isn’t.’Except, there is. There are books actually written about it. With carefully dissected examples of what throughout the history of literature and media all around us today, worked as a story, plot or characterization and, more importantly, what didn’t worked.And when I compared those examples of undoubted quality in long history with what Brandon tried here with, not just his characters but overall, in this book, it’s really not that much of a surprise that The Way of Kings doesn’t stand to a test of time.Not even three years passed when I noticed first problems, when I read more than 100 books of this genre and realized:‘Oh my God, there are far better books than this one.’.In essence, my problem with Kaladin’s characterization is this.You can show a character going through many changes in a story, but not all of them represent character change.True character change involves a challenging and changing of basic beliefs, leading tonewmoral action by the hero.What happens when we exclude stories about his past(those infamous info-dumps),stories that tells us how Kaladin’s character was shaped and came to be to the point where we meet him in his first chapter?Let's ask ourselves a question:Who exactly is Kaladin when we meet him for the first time?A capable young man who cares deeply about people in his unit, people he feels responsible for due to his tragic past. And he is willing to negotiate and work with people with whom he fundamentally disagrees. Lighteyes.Who is Kaladin at the end of the book?A capable young man who cares deeply about people in his unit, people he feels responsible for due to his tragic past. And he is willing to negotiate and work with people with whom he fundamentally disagrees. Lighteyes.Spot the differences there?No?Didn't think so.Let’s say I’m a potter. And I have a vase I want to reshape into something else. I start turning the wheel, reshaping and reshaping it – only to end up with a same vase again.Question is: why? Why spending my time, my efforts and my resources reshaping something into exactly the same thing itwasin the first place?And one can maybe argue:‘Well, it’s the journey, not the destination.’If the entirety of a journey is simply running in circles, then I’ll accept that. Because that’s exactly what happened here.Kaladin started from point 'A', went into journey of self-doubt and self-preservation, only to end up back at the same point 'A' he begin with.And that’s absolutely fine. Those are all changes.But that’s not characterization.Brandon keeps repeating this same mistake throughout this entire series.And do you know why I gave characterization of this book 2 and not 1?Apply all of which I've said about building Kalladin's character to a character ofAdolin Kholin.Who he is at the beginning and the end, moral conflicts that shaped his character inside of one cohesive story etc...Vast improvement.And do you know whose character is one constantly good thing throughout these five reads?Adolin Kholin, yes.Wonder why is that...About female characters I'll say only this: When you insist on copying female characters you created inElantrisandWarbreaker,and simply paste them from next series to next - I will call you on it.Sarene, Siri, Vivenna, ShallanandJasnahare all one and the same character.You make me miss thatMistborn'svery own Mary Sue:Vin.And just to be clear, female characters are not the only ones that get this unimaginative treatment.We have this reminiscent sidekicks:Teft.A blindly devoted, desperate in need of worshiping someoneGalladonfrom Elantris knock-off.Yes, Teft from The Way of Kings serves exactly the same purpose for main character in this book as did Galladon for main character of Elantris.Now, we only need someone who'll, like Galladon in Elantris, constantly repeat nonsense in a local dialect... something likesuleorkolo...Ah,Lopen,there you are! Yes,gancho,you, get over here,gon!I swear I see a pattern here...Worbuilding.I want to express gratitude for immense amount of effort Brandon’s team put up into creating artwork for this book. It’s really amazing, from cover itself, through maps to interior art.Just look at this map:Just look at it. Such beauty to look upon.Only to look upon, because, sadly, out of all of that, for almost two entire books we’ll spend time only on eastern barren cliffs.So, this glorious, beautiful map? You don’t need it. For two books you’ll experience three percent of it.(Red X marks the spot)Cliffs. Chasms and giant crabs.1100 pages long behemoth of a book and we’re left wondering not just how 97% of the world looks like, but also how society works on some basic levels.But I guess it was far more important to tell us that alcohol comes in variety of colors.And tease some cameo appearances in interludes that, as of yet, don’t serves to the main story.Prose.I passionately disagree with this logic how“If you’re not a writer and if you’re not eloquent enough in writing your own reviews”you shouldn’t criticize author’s prose.Do I need to be a mechanic to say that my wheel has fallen off?Do I need to be a firefighter to say that my house is burning?No?So why do I need to be a writer myself to recognize and say that author of this book is preposterously bad at writing.It’s either that, or he considers me an idiot. I do have self-respect, so I’ll go with the first one.Brandon Sanderson is lightyears behind those authors I consider decent ones.And mind you, English is not my first, nor second language, but still I’m able to recognize vastness in differences between authors prose. It’s not really science.And if we combine his fetish of constant repeating and reminding us thatJasnah(written with a J but spoken with a Y – as I said, illiteracy cuts deep in this one) is a heretic and thatSadeaslacksShardblade,at least three times per chapter with boring, witless and cringeworthily dialogues - novel is unbearably bleak and blatantly ridiculous.Just a few examples:Sadeas and his far too many times now mentioned Shardblade:""Sadeas's hand had gone to his sword. Not a Shardblade, for Sadeas didn't have one.""""The highprince hated that Adolin had a blade while Sadeas had none""""Sadeas was calling for his grandbow.""Remember, this is all within a single 15 pages long chapter.Second - dialogues. Those awful, awful dialogues:“I can see you are a woman of discriminating taste.”“I am. I do like my meals prepared very carefully, as my palate is quite delicate.”“Pardon. I meant that you have discriminating taste in books.”“I’ve never eaten one, actually.”As well as pitiful attempts at witty banters and humor:""Each man has his place. Mine is to make insults. Yours is to be: in-sluts.""Barum tssss....And my favourite, Sanderson's signature over-the-top bullshit:""Today I went fishing and I caught one. Very lucky fish other fisherman said.Cures aching joints for a good month after you eat it, and sometimes let you see when friends were going to visit by letting you read the shapes of the sound.""I mean, at this point, why the hell not?Allegory.Nonexistent.OK, Sanderson fans, what is this book about? What is the meaning, what is he trying to say, what’s the message?Is this book about racism? Criticizing it? I hope so. Because in this book, everyone is racist. Including Kaladin, our main protagonist.What?And how would you call a person who because of actions of two people with distinctive physical characteristics now hates everyone with those same physical characteristic?That's a definition of racist. And that's also Kaladin's POV.But, he's not the only one, no.Lighteyes people are basically Nazis. They hate anyone non-lighteye.Darkeyes people, or a common folk, of course, hate lighteyes and, because society thought them that way, they hate these slaves, these Parsh people.Parshendi, which are equivalent to Native American people... well, they hate everyone. Including themselves.And since everyone, Lighteyes, Darkeyes and Parshendi hate Parsh people, people who did no harm to anyone else, and who literally serve as slaves in this book - it only fits to make them as main villains, right?I told you this book is filled with Sanderson's over the top bullshit, didn't I?It’s a paradox how the only compliant and peaceful in collective discrimination of their race are mute, blackParshslaves which aren’t even consider as humans. But like that wasn’t enough in this, ocean of ridiculousness, by the end of this book they are proclaimed as story’s main antagonists.Empty vessels that could be filled with nothing but evil spirits.And on top of that, you'll add Shallan, our female lead, who'll say something along these lines:""Oh, but maybe they don't actually want to be free.""Thank you and goodnight.All in all, I understand everyone who likes this book and this series. It's just that I have read better books in my life, since my first read of this one. And the way I'm looking at reading books and what I seek in them - The Way of Kings simply doesn't provide anymore.It's a shame he got lazy in creating these worlds. But given how his readers will glorify everything he does, he would be crazy not to exploit that.Oh well...",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7235533-the-way-of-kings,The Way of Kings.txt
Elantris,"Warning: the review that follows is terribly unprofessional (you know, in the way that no one ever bitches about for some reason) and full of love and lots and lots and lots ofbecause REASONS.I think I've wished for half-stars maybe three times, at the outside, in the years I've been on Goodreads. Generally, though I may waffle between stars for a little while, I can settle on a rating which I feel accurately represents my feelings about the book in a...mostlyunemotional manner. (All my ratings are to some extent emotionally based; I am, after all, not a computer.)However, when it comes to Brandon Sanderson books I'm simply so biased that this system doesn't work for me. I'm not sure half stars would help, actually. What I really need is a system that breaks the book down into qualities like 'writing style' and 'plot coherency' which I can then rate out of ten because, considering them separately, I could probably manage more objectivity. This system would then spit out a rating based on the average of the subcategories, which would likely be lower by at least a star than my shiny emotional-first-reaction five stars up there.Since this system has yet to be created, let alone implemented, the five stars will stay. Take them with a grain of salt; the book is not perfect, but I honestly do not care.And now, after two preambles, we bring you the main event: an actual review of the book, and not just Anila's abstract feelings about it and the rating system. We'll start with the bad, because it's the smallest section.Like most first novels, Elantris suffers from some predictable problems. Sanderson's prose is rockier here than I'm used to - I've noticed over time that, logically enough, it becomes more polished with each new work, so of course this would be the roughest of them all. The two main characters, Raoden and Sarene, feel like prototypes of the characters he's put in his later work: they're larger-than-life and slightly messy combinations of the virtues and flaws that he's since separated out to make more realistic, tidier characters. Here we see the seeds of Kelsier's leadership and idealism, Vin's cynicism, Elend's bookishness, Jasnah's keen intelligence and sharp attitude. As is to be expected, all those qualities are powerful when used in moderation in other characters; here, they feel a little bit exaggerated and unlikely, particularly in Raoden. Speaking of Raoden - I love him, really (more on this later) but some aspects of his character felt a weeeeee bit deus ex machina.His unexplained 'affinity' for the Aons being the big one, of course.With characters like this, it comes as no surprise that scenes of conflict are underwhelming: not only are our heroes almost absurdly full of virtues, they're also extraordinarily talented and powerful in many areas. Everyone else is sort of dim next to them, and so any confrontation doesn't last long and no one really puts up a fight. It's hard to be invested in the tension of a scene or feel emotions at success when the ending was a foregone conclusion....I think that's all the bad stuff. Excellent. Let's move on to the meat of this review:things I love without shame or moderation.1. The concept. And not just the whole 'Eternity ended ten years ago' thing even though wow, what a killer tagline, am I right? No, what appealed to me most was the way Elantrians - now cursed - changed their natures to suit the situation. What they are has forced them to adopt or lose their minds to neverending pain, and it's really fascinating.""On the outside, people tend to be convinced of their own immortality. We are more realistic. One rarely wins a battle without at least a few wounds, and here even a couple of slight cuts can be more devastating, and more agonizing, than a swift decapitation.""This is most interesting, I think, for its contrast to conventional fantasy. Usually in a fantasy novel there will be someone who can heal with a touch or a spell or a potion; failing that there are herbalists, doctors, sometimes even surgeons. The Elantrians, however, have none of the above nor the resources they would require to be effective - and on top of that, even if they did, their wounds would still never heal. The way this changes their interactions varies depending on the situation, but in general creates a world where only the half-mad actually fight other people. One injury too many means a fate worse than death; it could turn a previously sane man or woman into a listless broken wreck who can do nothing more than chant a mantra of their greatest regrets over and over and over again.This is really astounding, in a worldbuilding sense, and forces what might otherwise have been a violence-centric story to become one of diplomacy and negotiation. It's also all the more painful when people are injured, as does happen from time to time, because the reader knows what they are suffering and that they have lost the last shred of their humanity, but will be forced to live on without it.2. Raoden.I have...feelingsabout Raoden.The truth is, I sorta adore all the male characters Brandon Sanderson creates. Raoden, however, is the only one I want to pluck out of the book and mash faces with.(If Kelsier were real, he and I would be at loggerheads over the whole 'wiping out a group of people because of circumstances beyond their control' thing, and as for Elend, well, wouldyoudare to steal Vin's man? No, thought not. Kaladin is too good for me, and also belongs right in that book where he already is, thank you very much, so I can have more wonderful exploits and badassery to read about.)which is not really a spoiler but actually a tangent.Raoden started worming his way into my heart on page 51. How?""Books!"" Raoden said with excitement.Open note to all authors: any character who reacts exuberantly to the presence of books will start out in my good graces. If it's your love interest, well... bonus points are an understatement. Enthusiasm for books and enthusiasm for whales are two hugely appealing things to me.Anyhow, that's really just the beginning. Raoden is the kind of character who, like Kaladin, would be the center of a lot of montage scenes if this book were made into a movie. He's one of those leader types who goes in and gathers people who all love him and help him work towards a goal and they're successful and it's beautiful and deep down inside you know it can't last because the montage is just leading up to the big emotional moment when everything goes south, but you really really really want them to just do everything right and live long happy lives in the paradise they've created for themselves. Ilovemontage scenes, and I love the people who orchestrate them, and really this is kind of pathetic but one of the easiest ways for a character to become sympathetic and engaging is for them to participate in one. Trufax.There's also the fact that not only is Raoden enthusiastic about books, he recognizes their value as a resource anduses them to solve problems. Words cannot express how many characters in how many books could have fixed their shit right up if they would justgo the fuck to the library, or the nearest comparable resource. (I include older, more knowledgeable characters in 'resources', by the way. Seriously, guys, sometimes adults really do know something important. Talk to them. It bears noting that this is only a little bit of a tangent and not actually off-topic, because Raoden makes a point of learning from other characters. WUT.) Raoden manages to figure out a great deal about Elantris and what caused its problems by careful research and logical deduction.I do agree with the assertion that he comes by this deduction rather too easily, the same way that he gets a nebulous 'affinity' for Aons rather too easily. Buuuut... whatever. And anyhow, the primary tidbit of information that enables him to solve the riddle - that the basic Aon represents the major geographic features of the land - comes from someone else, so that gives him a little more leeway in my eyes.Umm. There will be more (spoilery) fangirling over Raoden later. Yes, in a whole other subsection. This is what I mean byfeelings.3. Sarene....a lanky, brusque woman who was almost past her prime.Sarene is not my favorite of Sanderson's female characters. That would be Jasnah Kholin, always and forever. She is also not the most well-rounded or well-developed character in this book, and she has a lot of habits and characteristics that annoyed me.A lot of them annoyed me, though, because I see them in myself.Personal digression in spoilers; has nothing to do with plot:I'm eighteen and I've never once been asked out, let alone kissed. To my knowledge, no one has ever had a crush on me. I don't know why, and I'm not sure I would want to, because in general I really like who I am, but sometimes (especially when I'm talking with friends my age who have steady boyfriends or, even worse, change boys frequently) I'm struck by a feeling ofmissingness. Something is absent. I form perfectly wonderful emotional connections with other people, and I have friends that I love like siblings or better, but the physical aspect is just - not there. It's not something I worry about all the time, not by a long shot. I'm not a particularly physical person; I don't wish I had a significant other so I could jump their bones. But it would be nice to have someone I felt that comfortable with inthatway - someone who I could walk with holding hands, or whose shoulder I could rest my head on, or whose cheek I could kiss in just a casual, natural, affirmative way. I miss that, as much as anyone can miss something they've never had, and so I understand how Sarene feels so very, very well. The longing that she feels for that kind of emotional connection may be annoying to some readers, but to me it feels intensely real.Ummm.It's a little hard to re-ground myself after that. Sorry.Anyhow, Sarene. Yes. Sarene is apistol. I admired her spunk (for lack of a better word) from the get-go: she finds herself in a country not her own, legally married and obligated to mourn for a dead man she never met, frustrated by a king who thinks women are for decoration and court ladies who act as if he's right. And of course, as soon as she decides that the kingdom of Arelon is in trouble, she does everything in her power to help it, even though she owes it no obligation. Interestingly enough, she doesn't really do it out of pure selflessness.She had spent nearly three decades loving a country without ever feeling it loved her back. Teod had respected her, but she was tired of respect. She wanted something different from Arelon.Sarene is, I think, the second most flawed character in this book. She wants to do good, yes, but that's because she wants the affirmation she thinks she'll get from others. And the real kicker is:she doesn't know how to do the right thing. It's a sharp (and sometimes unfortunate) contrast with Raoden, who seems to come upon the exact right decision by constant good fortune to the point that it gets kinda annoying. Sarene, on the other hand, doesn't always have a complete picture of the situation and so she does what she perceives to be best at the time - which isn't always what's best in the bigger picture. This, of course, leads to some not-so-positive results, which is how it should be: flawed characters make mistakes and suffer for it and then they get better. I like that Sarene does this. I don't like that her mistakes are more frequent and more directly commented upon than Raoden's.His biggest one, in shoving her out of the city through the front gates after Hrathen's potion wears off, really really bothers me because he never even stopped to think about it, especially since it cameright aftershe explained Hrathen's campaign to get Arelon to convert. Actually, I kind of blame Raoden for the whole Eventeo-converts-to-Shu-Dorath thing, because if he'd taken a moment to consider everything that had happened, he probably would have kept Sarene hidden and devised a better strategy. This would be better if it were addressed as a mistake, but... it wasn't. So it niggles at me.The final word on Sarene, though, is still 'awesome'. She's smart, well-meaning, emotionally believable, and willing to kick ass when it's necessary.4. Hrathen. He justfascinatedme. Actually, as I think about it, I feel that a lot of the reasons that I liked Hrathen were the reasons Inspector Javert is my favorite character in Les Miserables, because they are both noble people doing bad things for all the right reasons, and with little malice in their hearts. I also loved, loved, loved Hrathen's religious conflict, and the way he struggled to balance what he felt his duty as a gyorn was with what he felt was right. He's got a lot of baggage from doing something purely from duty, and I felt that it affected his actions in Arelon to a real and nuanced degree.It didn't matter that he had acted in the name of the Church, or that he had saved thousands upon thousands of souls. The destruction Hrathen had caused in Duladel ground against his soul like a millstone. People who had trusted him were dead, and an entire society had been cast into chaos.Though at his introduction I'd expected Hrathen to become the villain of the novel, I was quickly sure that this was not the case. Far be it from the eminently skilled Mr. Sandersoncareful Anila your fangirl is showingto create a wholly unsympathetic villain, but even so the degree of attention he paid to Hrathen's conflicts elevated him fairly clearly to, if not protagonist level, at least secondary character on the 'good' side. I don't feel that's too much of a spoiler, since it becomes evident relatively early.My one reservation is what happens with Hrathen at the very end. I liked his actions, and that he turned away from the strict doctrines of Shu-Doreth to do what he felt was right, but I felt that decision was somewhat marred - nay,tainted- by the brief narrative comment explaining that he had been in love with Sarene. Umm... what? First of all, there was very little basis for real love between them. Mutual respect, yes; romantic love, no. (In Homestuck parlance, I'd say that they could have been morails or even kismeses at certain points butnevermatesprits.) It also felt a little unrealistic given Sarene's previous romantic experience - if she'd gone her whole life finding no man who believed himself in love with her, the idea that two would show up in such short succession is a bit preposterous.5. Religion. It's always a theme in Sanderson's books, and one that he includes on purpose, which I think is really quite fascinating. Because I've been aware of it as a theme since before I readWarbreaker, so I pay special attention to it. As always, it shines. There's not much to say about the way he handles it, actually, that I haven't raved about in other reviews - particularly forThe Well of Ascension- but I do want to mention that even though the religions here feel somewhat more derivative than I'm accustomed to from Sanderson - the schism between Shu-Dorath and Shu-Korath is painfully close to Islam and Christianity - I still found it to be handled tastefully. Now, I'm not religious myself so someone who is might be annoyed at things that I didn't notice, but I feel it bears noting that I, as an atheist, found the religions to be a believably central part of the world without feeling that I was being preached at, which is often a delicate balance and one that few authors even attempt to address as directly, if they do so at all.There are a few quotes regarding religion that I really, really loved:""Keseg taught of unity. But what did he mean? Unity of mind, as my people assume? Unity of love, as your priests claim? Or is it the unity of obedience, as the Derethi believe? In the end, I am left to ponder how mankind managed to complicate such a simple concept.""This one stood out to me because it's something I can really sympathize with. Even as an atheist, there's a lot of things about religions that I like - usually those that have to do with it as a social/moralizing force. It feels like Shuden is speaking for me when he comments sadly on the overcomplication of simple, positive ideas.""Everything happens according to Domi's will, child,"" Omin answered. ""However, I do not think that 'curse' is the right word. At times, Domi sees fit to send disasters upon the world; other times he gives the most innocent of children a deadly disease. These are no more curses than what happened to Elantris - they are simply the workings of the world. All things must progress, and progression is not always a steady incline. Sometimes we must fall, sometimes we will rise - some must be hurt while others have fortune, for that is the only way we can learn to rely on one another. As one is blessed, it is his privilege to help those whose lives are not as easy. Unity comes from strife, child.""Have you ever noticed how no one, ever, wants to answer one key question? I refer, of course, to the common query of the atheist: if a benevolent god exists, why is there so much evil in the world? To which most people will respond with vagaries about 'free will' and 'mysterious ways' and actually not answer the question in a satisfactory manner. Now, I have my issues with this explanation, but not only is it perfectly in-character,at least Sanderson made the effort. That really counts for something. I may not be rushing out to convert after such blinding and faultless logic, but I'm glad to know there are people out there who have put enough thought into their faith to be able to answer such an essential question.continued in comments because character limits.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68427.Elantris,Elantris.txt
The Name of the Wind,"I tried very hard to like this book. I wanted to like it. Critics liked it. Authors I enjoy liked it. But, try as I might, I did not agree with them.Before I get into what I didn't like, I will take a moment to acknowledge what I thought Rothfuss did well.GOOD STUFF1. The structure of the book was neat: a renowned hero recounting his life and demystifying the stories surrounding him.I like the idea of an adult criticizing the actions and beliefs of his younger self (Jacqueline Carey does this nicely in Kushiel's Dart). And I like the idea of the narrator's story being recorded as he tells it.2. The University setting was fun, even if it did feel too 20th century.I was excited to see a character attend school and slowly gain rank. (Unfortunately, Kvothe was promoted to graduate studies after about three days. Sorry, I'll save that for later; this section is supposed to be for Good Stuff.)3. Elodin was the one character I really liked, even if he was peripheral.He was one of the few that stood out as an individual. Then again, he got Kvothe to jump off a building, which is always a plus in my book.4. While Kvothe was not believable as a child when on the road with his parents or at the University (see Bad Stuff), he was believably young while living in Tarbean.I enjoyed this section of the book the most because it displayed his intelligence and resourcefulness through believable actions.And that's all I have for Good Stuff. Sorry.BAD STUFF1. The gaudy plastic star at the top of this fake Christmas tree of a list of grievances is Kvothe himself.It would be an understatement to say that I did not like his character. I found him unbelievable and derivative and written. I felt no emotional investment in him. At no point in the story did I worry he would make it out okay. At no point did he surprise me.One of my biggest problems with Kvothe was his age. He did not sound or act like a believable child (with the exception of Tarbean, as mentioned.) Moreover, he had to be a genius.Why?I am genuinely asking this. If you have an answer, let me know. So far, I have found no reason for Kvothe to be a child genius. It did not add anything to the story. There was no reason for him to learn so much adult material at age ten other than that it was a convenient time for him to do so. There was no reason for him to enter University at age fifteen other than that it was impressive. He didn't even act like a child or young teen. Why not age him so his thoughts and actions would make sense?Even his perceptions of the world as a child were remarkably adult. For example, his descriptions of his parents focus on what a great couple they were, snippets of their sexual banter, how attractive his mother was, and his hoping that they had a good sex life. These are not the thoughts of a ten-year-old child. Nor were these thoughts filtered in the narration as the reminiscences of Adult Kvothe. Child Kvothe seemed to regard his parents as a romantic couple, rather than mom and dad, who love him but also cramp his style from time to time.Kvothe's dialogue was far too adult and ""witty"" for his age. Show of hands, guys. How many of you gave perfectly polished speeches and witty retorts and spoke in well-received metaphors at age fifteen? I know I didn't. I could have forgiven a lot of this if Kvothe was portrayed as having a quick mouth but an immature mind, but even his moments of pride or stupidity still felt like the actions of an adult.And, of course, he had to be a genius. Advanced medical and magical knowledge at age ten? No problem! He can't afford to pay tuition at University? That's okay, because Kvothe is just so gosh-darned impressive that the school pays him to attend. A teacher attempts to humiliate him in class? Not only does Kvothe teach the teacher a lesson, but he is allowed to skip his entire undergrad education, because he is just that smart. Kvothe participates in the city's most difficult musical challenge that takes talented musicians years to pass? He's so amazing that he succeeds on the first try, and the audience is literally crying at the beauty of his music.Need I go on?Yes, I do, because in addition to Kvothe's never having to struggle with learning something or mastering a concept, there are all sorts of horrible retcons explaining his talents. For example, at one point Kvothe (age ten or eleven) needs to survive alone in the wild for a few months. Ideally, this could be a good learning experience of trial and error, but then we get a few paragraphs explaining that, by the way, one time this dude traveled with Kvothe's family and taught him all about trapping and skinning animals, how to build a shelter, how to start a fire, and what plants are good to eat. And we learn this just a few paragraphs before Kvothe's survival.How convenient.This challenge is no longer a challenge because Kvothe knows exactly what to do.Another example: Kvothe skips town to travel somewhere for plot reasons. He chooses to do this by traveling 70 miles on horseback in one day. (Yes, 70 miles in one day and ononehorse. But that's not even the bad part.) Again, at this point in the story, I thought this could be a good challenge: struggling to ride through the elements, learning how to work with the horse, and facing obstacles along the way. But again, we get a neat aside about how, by the way, Kvothe is a master horseman, because he grew up with horses, and so he knows how to ride and care for them, and how to pick out a good horse for this kind of journey. And again, we learn this about a paragraph before he mounts the horse and rides off.My problem with the above two examples is that Kvothe's ""learned"" skills become tidy deus ex machinas for the situations he has to overcome. Instead of learning how to survive in the wild, we are told that he already knows how to do that, so what was the point of making this a challenge? Instead of struggling to travel 70 miles with or without the constant demands of a horse, we are told that he is good at that too and he succeeds with little difficulty, taking all suspense and interest out of the scene. It would be one thing if, earlier and throughout the story, we saw him snaring rabbits or caring for his parents' horses (a.k.a. demonstrating his skills before they became necessary for the plot). The way these skills were presented felt cheap.(Never mind that, even if he was a master horseman, riding 70 miles in one day would be hell on his body. Particularly after not riding for five years. And Kvothe was ""sore"" the next day? He should not have been able to walk.)Not only is Kvothe a genius and talented at everything, but nothing in his narrative voice suggests that we are listening to the brain of a genius. Nothing in his diction, rhythm, or tone indicates this. I could accept a genius character if his voice reflected an unusual mind, but Kvothe pretty much just sounded like an everyman.I became so tired of Kvothe's perfection, of how impressive and smart he was, of how he breezed past obstacles that could have been character-building. He is one of the clearest examples of a Gary Stu I have ever read.2. I was going to call this category ""portrayal of women,"" but women are not really a part of this story.They exist to give birth (Kvothe's mom), be rescued (Fela), or fawn over Kvothe in wonder (pretty much every woman in the book). The only female character we spend much time with is Denna, so this category is for her.I found Denna to be spectacularly dull. I did not understand what Kvothe saw in her other than that she was hot. Attempts to make her mysterious and intriguing did not work for me. She is a pretty face hopping from man to man for money. (And, supposedly, she's really smart, so why doesn't she go to University too? Or get a job?)The passages devoted to Kvothe and Denna alone together were the most boring parts of the book. For being a couple of fifteen-year-olds, their dialogue was crammed with big metaphors and polished, ""witty"" one-liners.I was going to make suggestions on improving her character, but at this point, I don't care. She could have a dark backstory and I wouldn't care. She could be one of the freaking Chandrian and I wouldn't care. I cannot stress enough how much I didn't care about this character, and that's probably one of the worst things I could say about a work of fiction.3. While I did like the structure of the book (opening in third-person present day, switching to Kvothe's first-person narrative of his past), it did have its problems.Namely, the characters in the present day were poorly developed. I would have liked to know more about Bast and the Chronicler; hell, from their few interactions, I'd like to read a book just about them.Throughout the book, the narrative returns to Bast and the Chronicler. At these points, Kvothe clears up misconceptions and foreshadows later events, which was fun, even if his dialogue was plagued with too many permutations of ""If this was a story, XYZ would happen, but this is not a story."" The narrative usually returned to Bast and the Chronicler after dramatic things were recounted from Kvothe's life, and we saw their reactions.Did Kvothe just tell them something funny? Then Bast and the Chronicler are roaring with laughter. Did Kvothe relay how he did something amazing and clever? Then his listeners are wide-eyed in awe. Did Kvothe reveal something sad? Then they are crying huge tears of sorrow, and the Chronicler is wiping his eyes on the back of his hand, and Bast is croaking, ""I never knew!"" on repeat.The lampshading in this book was pretty bad.I do not like the author telling me how to feel, thanks. If an event in the book is truly sad and written well, then I will touch on my own sad experiences and bond with the characters. But being shown how Kvothe's audience laughed and cried at everything he shared with them felt a lot like watching a sitcom with a laugh track. This was made even worse when Bast would exclaim how sad an event in Kvothe's life was, and then Kvothe would say something along the lines of, ""Yes, it was terrible, but I still did not know real sorrow because even worse was yet to come.""Stop. Readers engage with emotions eagerly. You do not need to tell us how we should be reacting.4. This book felt largely plotless.Yes, it is the first installment of a trilogy and thus an incomplete fraction of Kvothe's life. But a good book can stand alone, even if it is part of a larger work. In a well written and well plotted series, one book will contribute to the overarching plot, but also resolve its own.There was no definable plot here. ""Kvothe grows up in a few different places and goes to school"" is not a plot. ""Kvothe wants to learn the truth about the Chandrian but learns pretty much nothing about them"" is not a plot.Arguably, since this trilogy is a recording of Kvothe's life, it doesn't need a plot. After all, my life doesn't have a definable plot. But I think that argument can only extend so far in fiction. A book is not real life. The story needs to have a shape.Kvothe's accumulation of skills and knowledge did not equip him to handle a major threat at the end of the book. His time at the University did not culminate in a big struggle for him to come out on top of (only minor incidents). He didn't learn much about the Chandrian. We still know nothing about Denna and things between her and Kvothe haven't changed. Kvothe did come to terms with his grief, but that happened about halfway through the book.Moreover, his struggles were mostly comprised of outside forces, such as being poor or bullies being mean to him. With a few exceptions, I did not feel that he grew as a character from overcoming these obstacles. Some of this is due to the aforementioned retcons (by the way, Kvothe is a master horseman, despite us never seeing evidence of this in the previous 500 pages.) And some of this is due to how he overcomes his external obstacles in external ways.Crisis! Kvothe is so poor that he cannot afford room and board at University. Good thing he succeeds at that super difficult music competition on the first try, thus giving him bragging rights and the ability to play for money pretty much anywhere in the city.Crisis! A giant, vegetarian dragon is chasing him down. Good thing Kvothe literally stumbled upon barrels and barrels of a lethal drug to knock the beast out.Crisis! Kvothe is banned from the University Archives. Good thing he happens to meet this weird woman who lives in the underbelly of the school, and who can show him a secret entrance to he Archives.And the like.There's nothingnecessarilywrong with these struggles--except that they happen over and over and over again. Very rarely does Kvothe face problems brought on by his own arrogance/stupidity/etc.; it's just the World hurling problems at him. And I, for one, appreciate characters who have agency--both to get themselves out of trouble, but into more plot. I am even more appreciative of characters who breathe, make mistakes, and change.I did not get this from Kvothe. The Kvothe I met at the start of the book (for either timeline) was the same as the Kvothe I ran away from on the last page. When I stood Beginning Kvothe and Ending Kvothe side by side, I couldn't tell the difference.The character did not have enough agency to shape a gripping plot, and the plot did not shape a gripping character.This book did not have enough of a shape for me.ULTIMATELY...While I did not like this book, at the very least, I can credit it for demonstrating errors to avoid in my own writing.I know a lot of people loved this book, and I would like to know why. Genuinely. Tell me what I'm missing.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/186074.The_Name_of_the_Wind,The Name of the Wind.txt
Mort,"In a Nutshell:Never thought I’d be an outlier for my very first Terry Pratchett book. Maybe this was the wrong book to begin the exploration with. But it felt very young adult in style and quite flat in character and plot. The titular Mort was not as appealing as the intriguing Death, who is mostly kept to the background. I hope my GR friend Ian doesn’t mind my borrowing his astute observation: “too little Death and too much Mort.” That sums up my problem perfectly.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Plot Preview:Mort is an inept resident of Discworld with a good heart and zero common sense. Worried about his son’s future, his father decides to loan him as an apprentice to whoever would hire him. As luck would have it, Death aka the Grim Reaper is looking for an apprentice, and seeing Mort’s response to his arrival, picks him up immediately. (It helps that all the other candidates were already chosen.)Death plans to let Mort help him collect souls with his scythe while he himself explores what humankind has to offer. With Death’s powerful scythe, an ability to walk through walls, free lodging, and access to the magnificent Binky, Mort thinks he can handle what has been asked of him. But the question is: can he actually do so?This is the fourth book of the Discworld series, and the first book of its ‘Death’ subseries. I haven’t read any Discworld book prior to this one, but this seems to be self-sufficient in its info and can hence be read as a standalone. Of course, I might have missed out any Easter Egg references to prior books without even realising the same.Bookish Yays:🦄 Some interesting one-liners herein: some witty, some deep, some both. Here’s one of my favourites:“History has a habit of changing the people who think they are changing it.”🦄 Who would have thought that Death would have a horse named Binky? That is such an absurd and hilarious name! I wish Binky had a greater role in the story. He was a champ!🦄 I love the cover of this edition. (Though it created very different expectations about the content.)Bookish Mixed Bags:🔮 The book is something like a philosophical fantasy with a hefty dollop of satire. Of these three things, philosophy never works for me, and sadly, philosophy is quite dominant in the writing. The fantasy part is quite lowkey: good but not mindblowing.🔮 Somehow, books with Death as a main character have almost always worked for me. This book too would have, had Death had a more active role. Though his character was primary, the narrative is mainly reliant on the titular Mort, who isn’t as enigmatic or appealing.🔮 While the book held my attention in parts, the plot wasn’t consistent in holding my attention. A main chunk of it felt rambling in an episodic way. One event made me sit up straight, hoping for a swing towards the positive side, but this came only around the halfway mark, and it was still not the prime focus of the second half, which continued the meandering style. I *almost* gave up on the book many times after this point.🔮 The actual plot is quite paper thin, but the book is 270+ pages long, most of which is padding. I am very much a plot person, so there was no other way this could go.🔮 In theory, this book had my kind of humour, with double entendre, sassy remarks, satirical comments, and some situational comedy. But it worked for me only in bits and pieces, with the sex jokes being too cringeworthy. It was like listening to a standup comic, who has great jokes but only of one kind. After a point, when the one-liners start feeling repetitive, your smile starts wavering and your attention starts wandering.🔮 The Discworld seems interesting, combining some indigenous lore into a fantastical universe. If only it had a greater focus in the story! (Maybe it does in the remaining Discworld books.)Bookish Nays:💥 Mort is a character with potential, but the writing makes him appear unidimensional. Of course, this might also be because Mort has only one dimension – that of being a bumbling oaf. Either way, Mort didn’t work for me. And we all know what happens when the lead character doesn’t appeal to us.💥 The two primary female characters – Death’s daughter and the princess – get some of the focus, but they barely have anything substantial to do. Their character development is almost at the zero level.💥 The narrative viewpoint shifts around too much, making the plot feel even more scattered.💥 The ending is truly disappointing, almost anticlimactic to everything established till that point. I would still have given the book a 2.5 plus rating had the ending been more satisfying than annoying.In short, this did not go at all like I had expected it to. I was so desperate to like it that I even tried the audio version for a few chapters, in hopes that it would click better. (Note: It did not! It was worse!)I am very much an outlier and frankly, I had not expected to be one considering how much I've heard about this series and how much I lovedGood Omens. This was my first Discworld book and maybe I should have started with the first one of the series as I usually do to appreciate the foundation better, or maybe it was just the wrong time, or maybe this just wasn't meant to be.At this point, I don’t know if I want to read more Pratchett. I have always seen praises heaped on his writing, but sometimes, even our best efforts cannot ensure a connect with some books. A part of me feels that I *might* have liked this in my teen years, when entertainment superseded logic and character development. It has a strong YA feel, and at this stage of my life, I am allergic to YA-style writing.Basically, I am glad this is a hit for so many readers. If I feel generous in another decade or so, I might just give Pratchett a second chance. Reviews do say that the subsequent books are better, so who knows! Bidding a temporary (?) adieu to Pratchett for now.2 stars.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Connect with me through:My Blog||The StoryGraph||Instagram||X/Twitter||Facebook||",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/386372.Mort,Mort.txt
A Memory of Light,"2 years and 2 months, 4,373,157 words, and 11308 pages later, thus concludes my journey with the Wheel of Time.It always feels odd talking about a book of this nature, due to the level of commitment I’ve given. It’s a bittersweet experience, there’s a lot to love, and there’s a lot to feel disappointment about (or even dislike), but it feels odd saying goodbye to these characters. You know them so intimately, whether you love or loathe them, it feels like people you have known for a long time. Wheel of Time is a series I love. It has a ton of flaws, if you see my prior reviews, you will know, but a lot to love. Which is a good segue to A Memory of Light, there’s a lot I love, aspects I feel disappointed upon and some I genuinely dislike. I’ve talked about it prior, but Sanderson taking upon the weight of WoT, and he was a relatively new author at the time, and concluding Jordan’s vision in this manner is nothing short of a miracle.Firstly, this is the perfect end to Rand al'Thor 14 book story arc. It’s evident Jordan had this in mind from almost the beginning, all of Min’s visions are fun to look back upon and seeing how certain prophecies comes to light. In general, most of the Two River folks had fitting ending. For a series of this size I wish we had more of a conclusion but considering the circumstances of Jordan’s passing it’s understandable.There’s a lot of this book that feels rushed, which is odd for a book of this length. There's a lack of multi-book payoff, some characters don’t even get conclusions at all, many plotlines just fade, the fates of certain antagonists, and there’s an introduction of new faction that felt cheap and should have been introduced books ago. The issues in this book, kind of stem from the series as a whole. It’s the mismanagement of certain plot threads in favour of ones that ultimately feel stagnant. These problems arose before the slog, but it’s mainly in the slog where certain plot lines feel directionless and some have incredible focus, which creates a disconnect. Jordan felt like he understood he went out of control, hence the massive course correction in Knife of Dreams. However, Jordan couldn't finish his vision, so Sanderson had to take reign and use various notes to get to the conclusion that he wrote. As a result, Sanderson had to cram a lot of things into the last 3 books. Lastly, the pacing of this book felt very uneven. It’s difficult to criticise Sanderson with the structure, but I do think overall he did a great job, however the beginning there’s simply too much action. At a certain junction the action feels a bit monotonous. However, once we arrive to the last battle, it evens out pretty well and delivers some of the best moments in the series.I say this above due to my overall love for the series. You are sometimes more critical of the works you love or want to improve because you enjoy them so much. So, what’s the strength? Well, as I said above, Rand’s arc was perfect. The beginning of the book had some character interactions that were beautiful, all of the Mat scenes are incredible. Like this is the book, where most of the Sanderson issues with Mat got completely ironed out with some differences. The majority of Rand’s POV chapters were brilliant and bitter, as we are leading up to the conclusion, and seeing everyone interact with each other before or during the Last Battle was great. The chapters after 37 were incredible, they're reminiscent of some of the best highlights of WoT, and overall, it was a cathartic journey. I loved seeing The Two River Folks interact with each other after certain characters were isolated from each other.Olver:blowing the horn was one of my favourite moments in the series. It’s soothing to read after what our heroes had to endure in the Last Battle. Beautifully echoing the Great Hunt. The last thing I have to note Olver reunion with Noel was very sweet.Lan:beating Demandred was great. I loved the lead-up to it—the Two River folks destroying the Trolloc’s with their bows as Lan is charging forward to duel him. His death was a great way to end Chapter 37: the Last Battle, giving that glimmer of hope near the end where all seems lost.Mat:I’ve said above, all of Mat's sequences were incredible. The world is ending, and Mat is still acting like Mat, his relationship with Tuon was actually a great one, as him being the leader of the Seanchan. I really felt his killing Fain was quite fitting, especially using that dagger. That said, leading up to that event was super disappointing. The dude does nothing for books 10–12 and appears in the prologue of book 13 briefly, then appears briefly near the end of book 14. I have to assume Sanderson had no idea what to do with him beyond reaching that conclusion, as it was shown in the epilogue Jordan mostly wrote.Androl (and Pevara):this is both positive and negative. Firstly, I love what Androl represents, especially in contrast to the Aes Sedai. The White Tower is all about power = authority, especially when it’s revealed in NS. The Aes Sedai aren’t equal, but there’s a hierarchy based on power. So, it’s refreshing a character, isn’t that, he just has a certain talent, but his actual innate power level is very low, so he compensates for it and earns the respect of his men. He’s a fun character that Sanderson wrote, plus Pevara is a ton more likeability with Sanderson at the helm. However, as a result, Logain is completely put aside. The dude arc wasn’t that satisfying after 14 books of build-up for Logain, and this was a result? After CoT and KoD, I was excited for the future of Logain, especially how he related to Rand’s plotline, then he just disappeared in the Sanderson books. There was some neat moments, it wasn’t a complete disaster, but it was so disappointing. The Black Tower as a whole just screams, that’s it? Plus Androl's final action to get Taim to escape, then the black tower felt like Deus Ex Machina. This also serves another issue of spending too much time on this character instead of the other characters that need more character depth. As a result, I do enjoy his involvement, but I don’t know if it was worth it. I do see part of the issue with Jordan not having enough scenes in the Dark Tower, plus in one-off chapters in the prologue or elsewhere, but still, this whole thread was disappointing.Demandred and Taim:I think Demandred ended up as a neat positive. The dude was like an antagonist for a video game and was super over the top, but he was actually fun to read. However, it is definitely not the best forsaken. That said I would have definitely preferred if Jordan stuck to his initial idea of Taim = Demandred as that would have had more weight. In general, Taim has to be the most disappointing figure of them all. He felt comical and lacked any depth he had previously, like in Books 6-11. I love the Egwene ending, especially reversing Bale Fire, that definitely felt Jordan, and that made sense, just as an antagnoist was whatever.Sharan:The same with Demandred, but even more so, what the hell were Jordan and Sanderson thinking? This has to be one of the dumbest decisions. Why introduce this faction this late in the game? I don’t buy it, it had two lines of foreshadowing in the entire series, so it’s fine. This felt like an excuse so Jordan-Sando could level the playing field. As a result, it really hurts the weight of the moments. Jordan excels in culture, making a group of people feel alive, yet Sharan didn’t feel like that at all. They didn’t really feel like people as they weren’t given enough time or care, which is baffling that we never even saw a Sharan POV in one of the prologues in the series. Slowly building them up so their arrival feels natural.Perrin:I loved most of his plotline, I really liked his pseudo-Buddy Cop adventure with Gaul in the World of Dreams. The final fight with Slayer was bloody excellent (especially the flicker flicker) and I loved seeing Lanfear again as she is one of the best Forsaken who are truly scary. I liked Perrin interactions with the cast especially with Rand and him observing the arrival of Moraine. One aspect I’m very mixed on is Lanfear faking her death. On one hand, it fits Lanfear's character but undermines Perrin's arc drastically. Him killing Lanfear with his own free will, killing a woman, not being forced to do so through compulsion. It’s a win-and-lose situation, but ultimately it hurts Perrin’s arc. I genuinely felt Sanderson handled it differently, like Lanfear manipulating him earlier on and then killing her with his own free will. I don’t think we lose anything if Lanfear lives or dies, as other Forsaken are still felt loose in the world, and other dark ones. Overall, Sanderson did a solid job considering the circumstances, as Jordan only had notes for Perrin after the Last Battle, which explains his absence in the event itself. Even in the epilogue, the Perrin POV was Sanderson, and the rest was Jordan. Which is sad but makes sense as his arc has been very messy throughout the series.Galad:honestly, I’m impressed by this character by the end. He went through a lot of self-evaluation, and his perspective was interesting. I do think Gawyn is a tool—the most preventable death in the whole series, however, his speech to Galad was somewhat nice, and Galad's action afterwards showing his honour. In the last two books, he was a pleasant surprise.Egwene:I’ve already talked about her final moment, so I will talk about everything else. Honestly, it was a pleasant surprise. After ToM, I was concerned about her, but here she felt like the stubborn woman from the Two Rivers. I liked her last interaction with the Two Rivers folks, and in general, her arc was great.Nynaeve:she is in my top 3 characters in the whole series, so I was disappointed we didn’t get a Nynaeve moment. She had that small scene near the beginning, but like 3 books and WH and so forth, she had those amazing Nynaeve moments. I know it makes sense that it's a trust thing in the cave, but I wish both she and Moiraine had more to do. I do like how all three of them (Rand) dealt with Mordin fate and the Dark one ultimately, that felt fitting and was very well foreshadowed throughout the series.Moiraine:Though I wished she had more to do in the second half of the book, I really loved her interactions in the first half with Rand. Her diffusing the situation of Egwene and Rand argument was so fitting.Thom:That one POV chapter he had was bloody amazing, it felt so in character for him to detect the fake versions of certain characters and guard the cave from intruders.Elayne:I’m most surprised by Elayne in this book, as I mostly liked her chapters. She had a lot of great moments throughout. I did wish we experienced Birgitte POV throughout the series and her memories slowly fading (which would have been amazing to explore), but I loved it the same. She has always been the bright spot in that plotline. I will say I wish Hanlon's storyline wasn’t even a thing by the time of AMOL, it felt out of place. However, Birgitte regaining her memories makes it feel like it was worth it.Aviendha:I really enjoyed her arc, trying to have the Aiel join the Dragon Peace to prevent that disastrous future for them. I wish we had more character moments with her, but what we got was great. Avidendha vs. Graendal fight was excellent, and Graendal lost. Graendal losing by the same powers that she actively used to destroy people's free will was fitting. Furthermore, a nice homage to Path of Daggers, reversing the weave. The Conclusion of the Forsaken and our antagonists have been all over the place, but this one was fitting. I also like how Graendal actually felt smart for once, unlike her involvement in ToM and TGS.Moghedien:Look, I understand why this is her fate, it’s so Jordan could write that sequel trilogy that he couldn’t write, unfortunately. That whole situation is unfortunate, but seriously, it felt pretty cheap. We pulled this same card with Eladia, and that wasn’t great. In general, the slave solution with the Seanchan felt very unfinished. Like Egwene gives an incredible speech to Tuon about how Sul'dam can channel, there is no hint of how it really affects the people whatsoever. There were some efforts to try to be the middle man, but it wasn't enough for the subject this series has been exploring since Book 2 and Book 8 onwards. I do understand Jordan probably would have tackled it, but I can only judge what we got here.Side Characters:WoT did a brilliant job with side characters. I’m not even talking about Jordan’s indistinguishable Aes Sedai’s, I’m just talking about characters in general and how they appear so naturally within the plot. An example is when Egeanin appears in The Great Hunt, and she feels like the protagonist of her own story, a fully realised individual who happened to be in the background. Then she naturally appears in Winter’s Heart and is part of Mat’s plotline. For all the fault of the slog, characters moved around so naturally that on some sides, they felt like chess pieces. Bashere, Hurin, and some others die, and you don’t feel much. Jordan side characters feel like they are protagonists in their own story, while Sanderson feels like they are there to make certain characters sad, like Rand. This is not a criticism of Sanderson in general, as it isn’t an issue in the Stormlight Archive. I assume there are barely notes or nothing on those side characters, which is why they are barely addressed or not at all. Sando is attempting to complete someone else's vision with limited resources, even if those resources are quite helpful. These resources from a man who lived in that world for a good chunk of his entire life, being his life’s work. So yeah, it’s going to feel weaker as a result.Rand:I’ve written so much about Rand that I don’t feel like there's a point. All I can say is that it’s the greatest character arcs in fiction. I loved sparing with Tam, interacting with two river folks, talking with Moiraine, Aviendha, and Mordin, and how his plotline is a philosophical debate with the Great Lord. On why balance exists, that his utopia will end up causing the same issues as the Dark Ones vision of the world, it being Rand forcing the pattern for characters to be a certain way instead of following their humanistic tendencies. Rand’s conclusion was bloody perfect, and I’m glad Jordan was able to write Happy Rand at the end. The body swap was beautifully foreshadowed and felt quite fitting. Especially reading the Min’s visions in retrospect.Epilogue:It’s an odd ending, like the final couple pages are perfect (anything related to Rand), especially the last line. It’s just that WoT became more than just Rand’s fate, which this book empathised the most, so it feels like those characters are not getting the conclusion they deserve. I do think if Jordan's health was good, this epilogue would have been heavily expanded while still being open-ended. It felt too rushed for a series of this magnitude. Like no mourning of Egwene in her funeral, no exploring the aftermath a little bit. Ultimately, I do like the ending. I wish it was longer, but it was damn fitting.P.S I loved the Nakomi situation, The Pipe, Nynaeve acting like Nynaeve, a fitting way for Mat arc becoming a father and continuing an adventure that we don't witness, the Loial moments was great, the Cadusane moment felt so fitting how she figured it out, and so forth. There were a lot of great moments!He came like the wind, like the wind touched everything, and like the wind was gone.In conclusion, I thank Robert Jordan for creating this story, and I thank Brandon Sanderson and Team Jordan for concluding Jordan’s vision. It isn’t perfect, but it’s something truly great. I love WoT. The journey wasn’t perfect, but it’s not one I will forget.There are no endings, and never will be endings, to the turning of the Wheel of Time.But it was an ending.8.5/10",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7743175-a-memory-of-light,A Memory of Light.txt
Reaper's Gale,"""Never mind the truth. The past is what I say it is.That is the freedom of teaching the ignorant.""You know, we spend our lives in ordinary mundane affairs. We behave in a mundane way, we dress in a mundane way. We walk to the office, we work in the office, we come home on the train, we say hello to our family and then we die.And thenEriksoncomes in and reminds us that we have another whole world of passion, of love, of frustration, of sorrow, of tragedy, of desire. You know, the entire range of human emotions available – through a book.It is a remarkable window, this book. It provides a good time, or an adventure, or an escape.Or even an excuse for us to be heroes, or a part-time villains(because, let’s be frank, nobody wants to end up a villain forever after).It provides an access to someone else’s train of thoughts and within it a whole new point of view, of this imaginary world, or perhaps, even the real world that surrounds us.Reapers Galeis a seventh book inThe Malazan Book of the Fallenseries and twenty first on my chronological reading order which includes bothSteven Erikson’sandIan C. Esslemont’swork.The story in it follows one year after the events from previous two books,Midnight TidesandBonehunters.We’re back on the continent ofLetherwhere we finally witness convergence of the characters and collision of their respective worlds, philosophies, powers, swords and – cussers.Oh yes.Malazansare here.Empire of Lether is conquered byTiste Edur.On the throne sitsEmperor of Thousand Deaths – Rhulad,surrounded by Lether bureaucrats, which successfully isolated him from his fellow tribesmen, leaving him all alone with the whispers of previous betrayals, doubts and regrets.Two opposing people now found themselves united, exploiting fallacies of each other’s systems of power and hierarchical structures: Edur got the crown – but does the crown wield real power?“The winners never won, because the losers refused to lose. An insane war.”Tiste Edur struck, then Kingdom of Lether, pre-emptively, in response to the threat of losing their land and resources. A sort of economic war that, through fighting to avoid cultural assimilation and end of their independence, quite paradoxically grew into conquest of their own.But, within a year of their occupation of Lether people, they have realized that a far more subtle conquest had taken place – conquest of which they were the losers.“They are here. On this shore. The Malazans are on our shore. And they burned their ships.”Finally, on the distant, never before explored continent, Malazan professional soldiers get to do what they were made for. Away with the columns, away with the marches, belay with the orders of the high command and their chess wars. Now it’s the time for Guerilla warfare. And Malazans are bloody and vicious in it.After seemingly losing their purpose, cursed in endless following bloody footsteps in the shadows of their predecessors, never to fulfill their expectations,Bonehuntersare lost.There are big shoes to fill:Dassem Ultor,first sword of Empire. The legendaryBridbeburners.WorshipedColtain’s 7tharmy. Each name heavy with legends of their deeds, justified with their purpose.Bonehunters were hurt. They are taking everything away from them. First battle. First win. Their own people doubted in legitimacy of their actions, they even tried to take the truth from them.Well,Adjunct Tavoreof the houseParan,will have none of that.“Compassion is never enough. Nor is the hunger for vengeance.But, for now, for what awaits us, perhaps they will do.We are the Bonehunters, and sail to another name. Beyond Aren, beyond Raraku and beyond Y’Ghatan, we now cross the world to find the first name that will be truly our own. Shared by none other.We sail to give answer.”While we wait for inevitable clash between the Empires, others are questing.Tiste EdurFear Sengarand albinoTiste Andii Silchas Ruinare on a quest of finding the soul of Edur’s deityScara Bandaris, Scabandari Bloodeye,but each with their own purpose. One to ask his God to help his hostage brother, the other, seemingly on quest for vengeance against that God, because in distant past, he was betrayed and stabbed in back by him.Other quest involves another Tiste Edur,Trull Sengar,aT’lan Imass Onrack T’emlavaand a wizardBen Adaephon Delat,who are send to find‘the borders of a dreamworld.’Of course, as with every other of his books, we are introduced with a complete new cast of characters, tribes and nations.This time those are united tribes ofAwlthat rebel against oppressing Letheri Empire, led byRedmask,a mortal sword ofK’Chain Che’Malle.Which, of course, means that at his side he has two beautiful beasts,K’ElhuntersSag’ChurokandGunth Mach.And combined, they are as vicious and deadly as they are beautiful.And, of course,Karsa’sthere. Glorious in his character's mediocrity.I know that there are a lot of fans of this character. To me, however, he brings this sense of boredom and predictability, something that I'm not used reading in these books.But, I have complained about him and explained my reasons why I feel like that in depth in reviews for previous books, so I'm not going to do that again.I guess that, after seven books in the series you highly enjoy reading, it's not that strange finding yourself at a loss of superlatives. Mainly because you don't want to sound repetitive. Saying again and again, how this is, in your honest opinion, the best high fantasy series - ever.So, instead of repeating what's already established and exploring that in depth yet again, I mainly want to focus on problems and acknowledge that they exist in this book.It takes a while for this book to start, sort to say. Although we begin with known characters, and while we are getting familiar with new setting and the surroundings, first time we actually feel like at home, is when Bonehunters enter the fray.And the reason behind that, in my opinion, is because of what they bring.Change of pacing, which until that point felt slow and repetitive, substantially gets better because of the structural narrative of how they were portrayed in this book.Bonehunters, as a unit, are spread out all around the empire in minor units consisting of 15 soldiers.Many of which get their own point of view.And this, besides making pacing better, works on other levels as well, like getting familiar with the soldiers, which means that departure with them will be harder.And I'll stop there.Sheltatha Lore, Sukul Ankhadu, Menandore rift.(Going from three-dimensionality of a character to only one):This is a problem that partially will have people who've read Kharkanas prequels.Those of you who have read Kharkanas prequels already met these three sisters/cousins and explored some of those characters in depth, as well as members of their families.Especially Sukul Ankhadu, who has a prominent role in those books, a character who is highly likable, and also, why not, both understandable and relatable.So, it's much explored in depth characters that, in this book, you couldn't have possibly feel that.Actually, if you remember what I have said here about Sukul Ankhadu while reading the book, you would probably think me mad.That's because, sadly, she and her sisters/cousins are nothing but words on a paper. There's no depth whatsoever about these characters.(But they veer into dragons and provide great battle sequences, so I guess, some of you are here for that...)AfterDeadhouse GatesandMemories of Ice,this is probably the toughest to get through emotionally.Those of you who have read these two books I have mentioned, probably know that Deadhouse Gates is tough to go through mostly because of the themes that exploits, while Memories of Ice, on the other hand, is excruciatingly hard because of the characters and your emotional investment in them.Reapers Gale combines both of that, just in a slightly lesser quantity.In conclusion: brace yourselves. Each for different reasons.Not an impeccable book, but highly enjoyable.3.83/5Kharkanas TrilogyForge of DarknessFall of LightPath to Ascendancy seriesDancer's LamentDeadhouse LandingMalazan Empire seriesNight Of KnivesReturn of the Crimson GuardMalazan Book of the Fallen seriesGardens of the MoonDeadhouse GatesMemories of IceMidnight TidesHouse of ChainsThe BonehuntersUltimate Malazan Chronological Reading Order",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/459064.Reaper_s_Gale,Reaper's Gale.txt
Toll the Hounds,"“History meant nothing, because the only continuity was human stupidity.”Where to even begin?From that magnificent ending? No, who starts with an ending?But in many ways,Toll the Hounds,eight book inMalazan Book of the Fallenseries is the beginning of an end. Interlude into a final bookDust of Dreams/Crippled God;book by which end all pieces are set and ready for a conclusion.Let's start with the necessary - but I promise very brief - what, where and who.We're back inDarujhistan,place where inevitable convergence is approaching. Convergence of characters, of destinies, past and future, old and new, friends and enemies, lovers, ascendants, gods, mules - all coming to a single crossroad.And that's not the only convergence in this book. Deep within the sword,ChaosandDarkare about to battle each other to extinction, possibly ending the world and all realms in it.The only force that is willing to oppose this imminent end is that which is bound and shackled to a wooden wagon, forces gathered through millennia, consisting of mutual dreaded enemies.Characters.Reading this book reaffirmed my opinion that all-powerful characters, such asAnomander Rake,hurts the overall quality of the story.Yes, you have read those lines properly. Bear with me.It's not that I hate having these types of characters as much is failing to see what other readers found so compelling in him and characters alike.I mean, I get it, he is all-powerful, veers into a dragon, have a badass sword, he is also profoundly mysterious and unfathomably tragic.And most of the time, that’s more than enough, because this is fantasy and something like this is presumable, right?But, at some point, this vast power, this larger than life part in the story, becomes a burden to a character. Because whenever he comes into a spotlight, readers expect""oooohh's""and""wwoooow's""from him. They expect to be awestruck.And that ultimately puts limitation on author himself, because there are expectations to be met and when author realizes he can't meet those expectations, like Erikson realized here*, they have none other choice than to put these type of characters on a shelf. To wait their opportunity to shine.*(Because would you believe it that Steven never intended for Anomander to have a big part in this series? Actually, Erikson himself was quite confused that Anomandaris was received so well by readers because, like myself, he wasn’t infatuated by him at all. Yeah, shocking, I know.But of course, because he writes for us, he gave us what we want. Well, what most of us want, in any case.)And if author doesn't have other compelling stories – or if he simply relies too much on a story of this magnificent character – we are bound to read endlessly:""No, it's not the time; no it's not the time; and no, it's still not the time.""throughout much of the 1200 pages of a book. Like in this one here.Honestly, at some point I heardJaffarsaying:“Patience,Iago,patience.”If other characters have to wait this one character; if other stories have to wait this one story to progress further – than that, in my opinion, hurts the quality of the story.And this is exactly what happened here. Other stories suffered because of it; stories such asCutter/CrocusandChalice D’Arlewhich we could completely cut off, and except 80 pages of the book, we wouldn’t lose much at all.Add on thatRallick Nomand his cousinTorvald Nom.Add evenEnvyandSpite.I would even go so far to cut offMapoandGruntle’sstory.All these stories, which served as an underwhelming supplement while we’re waiting – well, we don’t know what exactly is that we’re waiting – all we know is that:“It’s almost the time.”,I would completely cut off, saving approximately 400 pages, without losing any thread whatsoever.“Perspective, you see? The world changes according to where you stand.”Which leads us to last 150/200 pages, which were breathless. Something we’re quite used to seeing in Steven’s books and something that doesn’t surprise us anymore.Now obviously I can’t talk in details about it, but I’ll mention this: the main reason for me why last 200 pages kept me on the edge of my seat is mainly because of the prequels – story and character I’m following from them, all throughout this series, and seeing revelations and seemingly conclusion to that character’s arc. In all of my previous reads I wasn’t as invested as in this one, with all the prequels, as well as side-novels of this world, backing me up.Just because of it, again, I’ll recommend chronological reading order for anyone that has nerves, time and overall desire to do so.“To face death is to stand alone.”– Preparation for character’s death. –I love the fact that Steven was considerate enough to groom us and prepare for what is to come; for this emotional barrage and sad departure from characters that we love.In the story we have a character who dies. With Steven Erikson that’s not even a spoiler, it’s something that we expect in each book, at every corner to jump right at us.But the way he had done it, through seemingly insignificant character and within a minor story in the book, is a masterful preparation for his readers for what is to come by the end.""Sadness belonged. As rightful as joy, love, grief and fear. All conditions of being.Too often people mistook the sadness in others for self-pity, and in so doing revealed their own hardness of spirit, and more than a little malice.""Focusing so much and in so many details on this minor story and this insignificant character, and to let us grieve alongside these character’s friends, feeling their pain, paying respect to their fallen comrade, going through all these stages, denial, anger, grief and finally acceptance, actually helped in accepting what is inevitably to come, on our feet, with grace.Brilliance is in small details.Symbolism and allegory.""People don’t change to suit their god; they change their god to suit them.""What do you do when god refuses to acknowledge you?Would you transform your faith in desperate need for answers? Would you pick an easier way to find whatever meaning you can?What then hides behind your prayer? When the purpose of the prayer becomes seeking of hope or a blessing, or the sense that something greater than yourself might acknowledge your helplessness – all of which in order to serve your wants and needs – does a prayer becomes a meaning of reciprocity?Is a prayer nothing more for you than a bargain?The large part of this book centers on the questions: at the very beginning of the faith, in the cradle itself, who decides what and how do we worship? What is the ‘proper’ way of worshiping a deity?How is a priesthood born? What are the rules and prohibitions?And most of all: who defines this moral filter from which we could divide justice from injustice?Focusing on telling a story how wicked and dangerous priests can become, these mortal messengers of god’s word, how from each next generation that same god’s word can be twisted into something unrecognizable and made to suit selfish needs to whomever currently occupies the highest seat in this newly formed church – especially if when bombarded with questions this deity refuses to answer – we see how easy is for mortal opportunistic desires to become a dogma.Prose.I have seen many complaints about occasional shifting of structural narrative, and I have to say that I do not understand two things.First: why had Erikson decided to introduce this late in the series, practically at the beginning of the end, this change? Was it necessary; to whom actually can we prescribe this change in telling the story - this almost breaking of the fourth wall – and pinching the reader on his nose while doing so?If we prescribe it toKruppe– then why now? We had this character for four books and he never ventured into something similar in previous installments.But if we somehow manage to prescribe this to newly introduced character, this bard:Fisherman– then I suppose we can understand shifting.But I’m not sure that we can, so overall I’m confused and don’t understand this move Steven decided to make.Second thing that I don’t understand is why people are complaining so much about it? This shift in narrative structure in each chapter is perhaps four paragraphs long. Which means half a page in fifty pages long chapters per average. Which again, in twenty three chapters long book is merely above eleven pages.Now, one may try to build an argument around this and say how ten pages in a thousand pages long book actually managed to disturb or even ruin someone’s experience – but, to be honest, I wouldn’t call that a valid argument. I would actually name that something else.3.33/5Quite generous rating, if you ask me.Book is not only its ending, no matter how breathtaking that ending is.Kharkanas TrilogyForge of DarknessFall of LightPath to Ascendancy seriesDancer's LamentDeadhouse LandingMalazan Empire seriesNight Of KnivesReturn of the Crimson GuardStonewielderMalazan Book of the Fallen seriesGardens of the MoonDeadhouse GatesMemories of IceMidnight TidesHouse of ChainsThe BonehuntersReaper's GaleUltimate Malazan Chronological Reading Order",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/938544.Toll_the_Hounds,Toll the Hounds.txt
The Bonehunters,"""And so we weep for the fallen. We weep for those yet to fall.And in war the screams are loud and harsh and in peace the wail is so drawn-out we tell ourselves we hear nothing.""Can a sixth book in the series have a'second book syndrome'?Syndrome where book serves as a bridge we need to cross in order for the story, plot and characters to move forward? A bridge from introduction in the first book towards final conclusion?Considering how three out of five books so far were a constant introduction of new characters and new settings, where story and world were developing - outward and inward - when I look back from where we came from, pause and try to figure out where are we heading, it seems to me that this book have everything we need in order to say it suffers from that second book syndrome.Especially when I think about second half of this book.Now, I’m not one of those naysayers of this issue, it’s actually not an issue for me, at all.I understand why authors need this bridge, especially if series are far shorter, like in trilogies.Introductions so far, for Erikson, were almost stellar. He has this ability to suck you in, in the world, in the setting, with the characters and their stories, no matter how new and strange and different from previous books they were.And with those introductions stories in them moved forward and we went fluently with them.Who would say that almost three years have passed since the beginning of the story inGardens of the Moon?And yet, in book before this one we had an introduction. In book before that one we had an introduction as well.And this is the book that finally gathers around parts of all those worlds in previous five books and they finally get to introduce themselves to each other. We finally see convergence of different worlds.But, it’s too early for conclusions. In words ofAchilles:""It's too early in the day for killing princes.""Sort of speak.So, in my opinion, second half of this book has this syndrome. It(necessarily)prolongs and it’s far too long.And, unfortunately, some of the characters suffer because of it.(Quick Ben, where art thou?)Story.I would divide this book in two parts.First is pre-siege ofY’Ghatanand second… well, the consequences of it.14th Malazan Armyis onSeven Citycontinent, withAdjunct Tavore Paran, Fid, Kalam, Quick Ben, Gelser, Stormy, Truth, Bottle- and with the rest of the amazingBonehunters- across theRaraku Desertthey pursue what remained ofShaikrebels; hurrying to finally suffocate the rebellion, while, at the same time, desperately trying to outrun‘Mistress of Pestilence’and goddess of plague –Poliel.Which leads them to the siege of Y’Ghatan, an unprepared night attack, and fiery inferno that will follow.This siege is 150 pages long single chapter. It’s a beautifully structured novella inside of this novel.It’s emotionally exhausting and gut-wrenching, but it delivers on so many levels. You will have so many new characters to root for.Also, characters that have an appearance are formerCaptain Ganoes Paran,who is back from his retirement and has a few pairings, one of which is withApsalar.Which was quite interesting given their history and I have to admit, I actually like this pairing. A lot.Apsalar is in company of two ghosts,TelorastandCurdle,that animate two reptile skeletons, and in their back and forth banter, they serve as a comedic relief.Crocus, Heboric, ScillaraandYoung Felisin,on the other hand are a quite miserable gathering and company. Which doesn’t surprise me, since anyone that accompanies Heboric must be a miserable fellow.Second part of the book, of course, deals with the aftermath of the siege of Y’Ghatan.And here is that problem I was talking about. We see far too many chapters(and considering how Erikson’s chapter is 50 pages long per average, that’s a quite amount of pages)where characters are aimlessly roaming around the desert or the sea.And I understand, the reason for that is to give other characters time to catch up or finish their stories in this book, and give opportunity for all of us to enter that final crescendo, together, with a bang.Which we undoubtedly do.This is not me complaining, I really don’t mind this, but it is a fair warning that story will stretch out a bit.Characters.Karsa Orlong V Samar DevChallenger. That is what Karsa needs in order to be an interesting character.A challenger. Not of his vast prowess, Gods know that any skirmish Karsa enters, by the end of it, he is the sole survivor of it.And that’s dull and boring and there’s really no emotional investment, not just in the character but in the story itself, when you already know an outcome of it.Is it really the entirety of the emotional span we can have about him in the fact that we are easily amazed how strongly, quickly and viciously he deals with his enemies?Yes, indoor battle withK’Chain Nahrukis great, forest skirmish with the entireTiste Edurtribe is awesome, but at some point, whenever a new challenger crosses his path with Karsa, we already know that he is an expendable cannon fodder.And this is why I think that Karsa hurts the series; that giving him, and characters such asAnomander Rake,these unproportionately powerful beings, a POV is a bad thing.By giving a character more powers and making him all-powerful, you’re actually restricting that character. You’re confining him into a single sandbox and only certain characters can play with him.Either you have to invent an even more powerful character to challenge him or you have to strip away your character of those powers you already attributed to him in order for him to play with others.So yes, in my opinion, Karsa needed a challenger of his wits, of his philosophy of living, of viewing the world around him, and by fighting those types of battles, show us that he is more than one-dimensional character.I think that Erikson himself recognized this, because he introduced to us Samar Dev, an inventor and a witch.And Samar Dev is perfect for him. She is smarter than most people in Malazan world, she is independent, a scholar and explorer. She is almost completely opposite from everything he represents.She is also a witch that wields magic, ancient magic of this world, and she sees spirits and ghosts.And one thing that we know about Karsa is that he carries all of his ghosts, all the spirits of people he had killed – and he was busy in that work – chained around him.So, who better to understand this mess that Karsa Orlong of a character is, to whom better to give to, us readers, an access into a POV – than a person who spent her life exploring, inventing and dealing with things that Karsa is troubled? And when she finds the answer, we will find one, too.“’Sorcery, Karsa Orlong, that is the heart of the problem.’‘What problem now, woman?’‘Magic obviates the need for invention, beyond certain basic requirements. And so we remain eternally stifled-’‘To the Faces with stifled, witch. There is nothing wrong with where we are now, how we are. You spit on satisfaction, leaving you always unsettled and miserable.I am a Teblor – we live simply enough, and we see the cruelty of your so called progress. Slaves, children in chains, a thousand lies to make one person better than the next, a thousand lies telling you this is how things should be.Madness called sanity, slavery called freedom. I’m done talking now.’‘Well, I’m not. You’re no different, calling ignorance wisdom, savagery noble. Without striving to make things better, we’re doomed to repeat our litany of injustice.’‘Better is never what you think it is, Samar Dev.’”What I found interesting from their relationship is that, even though Karsa is a savage brute that spend most of his life secluded and is yet to learn of the world, while Samar Dev in contrast is a sophisticated explorer that traveled around half of that world – one can learn from the other.No matter how plain the language Karsa uses, how simplified his views on certain matters can be – those words and those truths have much to teach a scholar that recognized there’s a potential for learning.There’s no ego in Samar Dev because of her knowledge, no need for pretentiousness when debating with Karsa to showoff that knowledge, while on the other hand, her approach to him isn’t one of scientist’s to a sample that needs dissecting.But nonetheless, she is there to understand Karsa. In his core.First half of this book is amazing because of their relationship. The second half, unfortunately, we lose that Samar Dev I have described here, and instead of her we get another Karsa’s follower.And that’s a shame.In conclusion:I believe that first half of this series is a cynical representation of the Malazan world. Of everything that is wrong in it. Everything that is poisoned and infected by malice of theCrippled Godand his pain.The series had some recurring themes: misery, chains, honour, indebtedness, anti-war and just cause.In this book main theme, however, was relationship between Gods and their followers.Misinterpretation of how to worship and Gods misapprehension of their worshipers.That, as worshipers can denounce their Gods, so do Gods can denounce their worshipers, if one side goes too far.“Wouldn’t surprise me if all the Gods are just aspects of one God, and all this fighting is just proof that one God is insane. Or maybe just confused.The gentler and kinder the God, the more harsher and cruel its worshipers, for they hold to their conviction with taut certainty, febrile in its extremity, and so cannot abide dissenters.They will kill, they will torture, in that God’s name. And see in themselves no conflict, no matter how bloodstained their hands.Who wouldn’t be driven mad by all that?”And in this theme we finally see change and distancing from cynicism.After we see the peak of that cynicism, funnily enough, beneath the fiery flames of the city of Y’Ghatan, we start to descend from that peak and start the journey to long way down.From those ashes something new will arise, something we haven’t seen in this series so far.Hope.3.58/5Kharkanas TrilogyForge of DarknessFall of LightPath to Ascendancy seriesDancer's LamentDeadhouse LandingMalazan Empire seriesNight Of KnivesMalazan Book of the Fallen seriesGardens of the MoonDeadhouse GatesMemories of IceMidnight TidesHouse of ChainsUltimate Malazan Chronological Reading Order",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/478951.The_Bonehunters,The Bonehunters.txt
Midnight Tides,"Re-read rating: Brilliant!!! *** 5 ****** 4.65 ***A Buddy Read with my Fantasy Fanatics @ BB&B! Because we love ALL FANTASY!!!I need to start with one of the best quotes from the book, which I find eternally true and very current!!!""... “Do not seek to find hope among your leaders. They are the repositories of poison. Their interest in you extends only so far as their ability to control you. From you, they seek duty and obedience, and they will ply you with the language of stirring faith. They seek followers, and woe to those who question, or voice challenge. ‘Civilization after civilization, it is the same. The world falls to tyranny with a whisper. The frightened are ever keen to bow to a perceived necessity, in the belief that necessity forces conformity, and conformity a certain stability. In a world shaped into conformity, dissidents stand out, are easily branded and dealt with. There is no multitude of perspectives, no dialogue. The victim assumes the face of the tyrant, self-righteous and intransigent, and wars breed like vermin. And people die.”...Amen!!!In the end of the previous book, the Tiste Edur Trull Sengar decided to tell his story to his undead companion. This book is that story.Midnight Tides connected with me on an intellectual level much more than the previous couple of tomes. I had a visceral emotional reaction to ""The Chain of Dogs"", which was book 2, I really enjoyed the other three books, but this one spoke to my current state of disillusionment with the world around me very cerebrally. We would like to be able to compare the fictional and fantastical empires of Malazan and Lethar to long dead empires of ours, but Lethar's problems were very closely related to our Western powers of today. The systematic destruction of the middle class with the growth of both groups of the very rich and the very poor, is becoming the perfect growing field for all that the majority of us find deplorable and unthinkable, but it starts insidiously creeping up on civilization and it cyclically destroys it from within... Rich and poor with no vast middle class for stabilization, is a revolution waiting to happen. And we once again never learn from history's lessons.... But the best way to make the point of this book I will let my very favorite character of the whole Malazan series up to now, Tehol Beddict, lay it out the way only he could!!! :""... “As they walked, Tehol spoke. ‘…the assumption is the foundation stone of Letherii society, perhaps all societies the world over. The notion of inequity, my friends. For from inequity derives the concept of value, whether measured by money or the countless other means of gauging human worth. Simply put, there resides in all of us the unchallenged belief that the poor and the starving are in some way deserving of their fate. In other words, there will always be poor people. A truism to grant structure to the continual task of comparison, the establishment through observation of not our mutual similarities, but our essential differences. ‘I know what you’re thinking, to which I have no choice but to challenge you both. Like this. Imagine walking down this street, doling out coins by the thousands. Until everyone here is in possession of vast wealth. A solution? No, you say, because among these suddenly rich folk there will be perhaps a majority who will prove wasteful, profligate and foolish, and before long they will be poor once again. Besides, if wealth were distributed in such a fashion, the coins themselves would lose all value—they would cease being useful. And without such utility, the entire social structure we love so dearly would collapse. ‘Ah, but to that I say, so what? There are other ways of measuring self-worth. To which you both heatedly reply: with no value applicable to labor, all sense of worth vanishes! And in answer to that I simply smile and shake my head. Labor and its product become the negotiable commodities. But wait, you object, then value sneaks in after all! Because a man who makes bricks cannot be equated with, say, a man who paints portraits. Material is inherently value-laden, on the basis of our need to assert comparison—but ah, was I not challenging the very assumption that one must proceed with such intricate structures of value? ‘And so you ask, what’s your point, Tehol? To which I reply with a shrug. Did I say my discourse was a valuable means of using this time? I did not. No, you assumed it was. Thus proving my point!’ ... ""If the Malazan Empire is the mirror of The Roman, then the Letherii society mirrors the Byzantine Empire in its most decadent. Rome and its military structure, together with their laws, engineering, and religious Pantheon, were a power which conquered, took everything, but also propped-up the peoples it enfolded into their empire. There were taxes in money and people, but overall, they worked under a set of rules which were pretty reasonable (this is speaking as a person of today, I am not sure the people at the time perceived it the same). Byzantium drowned under the wight of its arrogance and greed. Their sense of ""destiny"" and belief in supremacy made them entitled and incapable of correct objectivity when it came to their military power, their enemies and the internal decay that was eroding the core of their culture. It is sad, because they had gone complaisant, soft and fat, but the arts, literature, music and intellectual culture were flourishing. It would take centuries for them to reach the same levels, until which humanity in that region had lost most of its soul...""... “Progress... is the belief from which emerge notions of destiny. The Letherii believe in destiny - their own. They are deserving of all things, born of their avowed virtues... Destiny wounds us all and we Letherii wear the scars with pride... We have a talent for disguising greed under a cloak of freedom. As for past acts of depravity, we prefer to ignore those. Progress, after all, means to look ever forward, and whatever we have trampled in our wake is best forgotten’ ... ""Everything in Lether exists only as far as its value goes. Gold can see a person and his family live well, or the lack of it can turn a family for generations to come into ""indebted"" = slaves. The ruling King, his Queen and their child, the Prince, are secure in the military and magical power of their kingdom, and see themselves as the fated rebirth of the foretold Lether Emperor and kin. The ruling class and the army leaders are so sure in their military prowess, that they start wars in order to gain more slaves and ultimately gold, with not a care for the people they conqueror. The poor are just a fother for the front-lines, to absorb the losses and perform the clean-up and manual labor. They are just throw-away lives, not real... Unless you are that poor person or their family... Udinaas is one of those indebted, who has been captured by the Edur and is a slave to them at the moment. Even as slaves, the Letherii continue segregating among themselves according to their status before being captured...""... “Udinaas well understood his own kind. To the Letherii, gold was all that mattered. Gold and its possession defined their entire world. Power, status, self-worth and respect—all were commodities that could be purchased by coin. Indeed, debt bound the entire kingdom, defining every relationship, the motivation casting the shadow of every act, every decision.’ ... ""The Tiste Edur tribes live in the shadows of legends which paint them as the victims of betrayal, while denying them the greatness they see themselves as deserving. However, the distinct and warring Tiste Edur tribes have now united under the Warlock King and are preparing to claim their destiny at the head of the Letherii Empire. Theirs is a tribal culture where coins have value only as decoration of the body of the fallen warriors. They have trade and slaves from the people they conquer, seeing no point in gold as a commodity. Being barbaric in the eyes of Lether, they are vastly underestimated and the inevitable clash, which the Letherii provoke, is bound to be much more contested than the refined and arrogant royals and army expect. After all, the Warlock King has made some very powerful and angry new allies...So, we have very traditional clashes of cultures, but the book is much more than just that. It is layer upon layer of stories, human fates, political intrigues, economic plots for collapse of the money market, and most of all, we have the various g-ds starting to really show their hand in manipulating the pawns of their choosing. Old, Elder, New, not-completely ascended and forgotten G-DS are starting to steer and the hapless humans, as well as other races and creatures, they use and abuse, in most cases are left bereft of a choice or having say in any of their participation on the game board of the all-powerful. Some of those G-DS arose some sympathy in me, but most of them are petty and selfish, and I wanted to smack or destroy them, if possible both! However, the mortals, or mostly mortals, we get to meet in this book for the first time, were endlessly entertaining, however pathetic, non-to-bright, undead, powerful or genius they might have been. On the Edur side I was very partial to Trull Sengar, whom we met in House of Chains. However, both of his brothers were very memorable, each in their own way, as well. On the Lether side, well, the list is longer, but I am completely in love with Tehol Beddict, the middle of another three brothers, who lives as a failed destitute businessman, with his faithful man-servant Bugg, who is much more than he appears. His philosophical musings made this book a pleasure for me to read. Seren Pedac was also interesting, although her path is very difficult to read about... Great characters who delivered comic relief are the undead Shurq Elalle and her amazing makeover, the three ladies business partners of Tehol, their bodyguard, the complete opposite of Karsa in everything but physical appearance, Ublala Pung, and all the members of the Rat Catcher Guild!!!! I was particularly partial to every moment the Guild's ""inspector"" was on page:):):):) This multitude of the character ensemble made the massive book fun to read and easy to follow. The story was very linear and flowed in a manner not typical for the previous books. However, it was paced perfectly and I was very, very pleased with it. As always, I would highly recommend this series to all those who love Epic and Military Fantasy and do not expect romance or rainbows to come with it. The author once again shows the ugly face of war and the crime that it perpetuates on the individual as well as humanity as a whole. Brilliant!!!""... ‘Destiny is a lie. Destiny is justification for atrocity. It is the means by which murderers armour themselves against reprimand. It is a word intended to stand in place of ethics, denying all moral context.’ ...

A Game of Thrones,"There are plenty of fantasy authors who claim to be doing something different with the genre. Ironically, they often write the most predictable books of all, as evidenced byGoodkindandPaolini. Though I'm not sure why they protest so much--predictability is hardly a death sentence in genre fantasy.The archetypal story of a hero, a villain, a profound love, and a world to be saved never seems to get old--it's a great story when it's told well. At the best, it's exciting, exotic, and builds to a fulfilling climax. At the worst, it's just a bloodless rehash. Unfortunately, the worst are more common by far.Perhaps it was this abundance of cliche romances that drove Martin to aim for something different. Unfortunately, you can't just choose to be different, any more than you can choose to be creative. Sure, Moorcock's original concept for Elric was to be the anti-Conan, but at some point, he had to push his limits and move beyond difference for difference's sake--andhe did.In similar gesture, Martin rejects the allegorical romance of epic fantasy, which basically means tearing out the guts of the genre: the wonder, the ideals, the heroism, and with them, the moral purpose. Fine, so he took out the rollicking fun and the social message--what did he replace them with?Like the post-Moore comics of the nineties, fantasy has already borne witness to a backlash against the upright, moral hero--and then a backlash against the grim antihero who succeeded him. Hell, if all Martin wanted was grim and gritty antiheroes in an amoral world, he didn't have to reject the staples of fantasy, he could have gone to its roots: Howard, Leiber, and Anderson.Like many authors aiming for realism, he forgets 'truth is stranger than fiction'. The real world is full of unbelievable events, coincidences, and odd characters. When authors remove these elements in an attempt to make their world seem real, they make their fiction duller than reality; after all, unexpected details are the heart of verisimilitude. When Chekhov and Peake eschewed the easy thrill of romance, they replaced it with the odd and absurd--moments strange enough to feel true. In comparison, Martin's world is dull and gray. Instead of innovating new, radical elements, he merely removes familiar staples--and any style defined by lack is going to end up feeling thin.Yet, despite trying inject the book with history and realism, he does not reject the melodramatic characterization of his fantasy forefathers, as evidenced by his brooding bastard antihero protagonist (with pet albino wolf). Apparently to him, 'grim realism' is'Draco in Leather Pants'. This produces a conflicted tone: a soap opera cast lost in an existentialist film.There's also lots of sex and misogyny, and'wall-to-wall rape'--not that books should shy away from sex, or from any uncomfortable, unpleasant reality of life. The problem is when people who are not comfortable with their own sexuality start writing about it, which seems to plague every mainstream fantasy author. Their pen gets away from them, their own hangups start leaking into the scene, until it's not even about the characters anymore, it's just the author cybering about his favorite fetish--and if I cyber with a fat, bearded stranger, I expect to be paid for it.I know a lot of fans probably get into it more than I do (like night elf hunters humping away in WOW), but reading Goodkind, Jordan, and Martin--it's like seeing a Playboy at your uncle's where all the pages are wrinkled. That's not to say there isn't serviceable pop fantasy sex out there--it's justwritten by women.Though I didn't save any choice examples, I didcome acrossthis quote from a later book:""... she wore faded sandsilk pants and woven grass sandals. Her small breasts moved freely beneath a painted Dothraki vest . . .""Imagine the process: Martin sits, hands hovering over the keys, trying to get inside his character's head:""Okay, I'm a woman. How do I see and feel the world differently? My cultural role is defined by childbirth. I can be bought and sold in marriage by my own--Oh, hey! I've got tits! Man, look at those things go. *whooshing mammary sound effects* Okay, time to write.""Where are the descriptions of variously-sized dongs swinging within the confines of absurdly-detailed clothing? There are a set of manboobs (which perhaps Martin has some personal experience with) but not until book five. Even then, it's not the dude being hyperaware of his own--they're just there to gross out a dwarf. Not really a balanced depiction.If you're familiar with the show (and its parodies on South Park and SNL) this lack of dongs may surprise you. But as Martin himself explained, when asked why there's no gay sex in his books, despite having gay characters,'they’re not the viewpoint characters'--as if somehow, the viewpoints he chooses to depict are beyond his control. Apparently, he plots as well as your average NaNoWriMo author:sorry none of my characters chose to be gay, nothing I can do about it.And balance really is the problem here--if you only depict the dark, gritty stuff that you're into, that's not realism, it's just a fetish. If you depict the grimness of war by having every female character threatened with rape, but the same thing never happens to a male character, despite the fact thatmore men get raped in the military than women, then your 'gritty realism card' definitely gets revoked.The books are notorious for the sudden, pointless deaths, which some suggest is another sign of realism--but, of course, nothing is pointless in fiction, because everything that shows up on the page is only there because the author put it there. Sure, in real life, people suddenly die before finishing their life's work (fantasy authors do it all the time), butthere's a reasonwe don't tend to tell stories of people who die unexpectedly in the middle of things: they are boring and pointless. They build up for a while then eventually, lead nowhere.Novelists often write in isolation, so it's easy to forget the rule to which playwrights adhere: your story is always a fiction. Any time you treat it as if it were real, you are working against yourself. The writing that feels the most natural is never effortless, it is carefully and painstakingly constructed to seem that way.A staple of Creative Writing 101 is to 'listen to how people really talk', which is terrible advice. A transcript of any conversation will be so full of repetition, half-thoughts, and non-specific words ('stuff', 'thing') as to be incomprehensible--especially without the cues of tone and body language. Written communication has its own rules, so making dialogue feel like speech is a trick writers play. It's the same with sudden character deaths: treat them like a history, and your plot will become choppy and hard to follow.Not that the deaths are truly unpredictable. Like in an action film, they are a plot convenience: kill off a villain, and you don't have to wrap up his arc. You don't have to defeat him psychologically--the finality of his death is the great equalizer. You skip the hard work of demonstrating that the hero was morally right, because he's the only option left.Likewise, in Martin's book, death ties up loose threads--namely, plot threads. Often, this is the only ending we get to his plot arcs, which makes them rather predictable: any time a character is about to build up enough influence to make things better, or more stable, he will die. Any character who poses a threat to the continuing chaos which drives the action will first be built up, and then killed off.I foundthis interviewto be a particularly telling example of how Martin thinks of character deaths:""I killedNedbecause everybody thinks he’s the hero ... sure, he’s going to get into trouble, but then he’ll somehow get out of it. The next predictable thing [someone] is going to rise up and avenge his [death] ... So immediately [killingRobb] became the next thing I had to do.He's not talking about the characters' motivations, or the ideas they represent, or their role in the story--he isn't laying out a well-structured plot, he's just killing them off for pure shock value.Yet the only reason we think these characters are important in the first place is because Martin treats them as central heroes, spending time and energy building them. Then it all ends up being a red herring, a cheap twist, the equivalent of a horror movie jump scare. It's like mystery novels in the 70's, after all the good plots had been done, so authors added ghosts or secret twins in the last chapter--it's only surprising because the author has obliterated the story structure.All plots are made up of arcs that grow and change, building tension and purpose. Normally, when an arc ends, the author must use all his skill to deal with themes and answer questions, providing a satisfying conclusion to a promising idea that his readers watched grow. Or just kill off a character central to the conflict and bury the plot arc with him. Then you don't have to worry about closure, you can just hook your readers by focusing on the mess caused by the previous arc falling apart. Make the reader believe that things might get better, get them to believe in a character, then wave your arms in distraction, point and yell'look at that terrible thing, over there!', and hope they become so caught up in worrying about the new problem that they forget the old one was never resolved.Chaining false endings together creates perpetual tension that never requires solution--like in most soap operas--plus, the author never has to do the hard work of finishing what they started. If an author is lucky, they die before reaching the Final Conclusion the readership is clamoring for, and never have to meet the collective expectation which long years of deferral have built up. It's easy to idolize Kurt Cobain, because you never had to see him bald and old and crazy like David Lee Roth.Unlucky authors live to write the Final Book, breaking the spell of unending tension that kept their readers enthralled. Since the plot isn't resolving into a tight, intertwined conclusion (in fact, it's probably spiraling out of control, with ever more characters and scenes), the author must wrap things up conveniently and suddenly, leaving fans confused and upset. Having thrown out the grand romance of fantasy, Martin cannot even end on the dazzling trick of thevaguely-spiritual transgressive Death Eventon which the great majority of fantasy books rely for a handy tacked-on climax (actually, he'll probably do it anyways, with dragons--the longer the series goes on, the more it starts to resemble the cliche monomyth that Martin was praised for eschewing in the first place).The drawback is that even if a conclusion gets stuck on at the end, the story fundamentally leads nowhere--it winds back and forth without resolving psychological or tonal arcs. But then, doesn't that sound more like real life? Martin tore out the moralistic heart and magic of fantasy, and in doing so, rejected the notion of grandly realized conclusions. Perhaps we shouldn't compare him to works of romance, but to histories.He asks us to believe in his intrigue, his grimness, and his amoral world of war, power, and death--not the false Europe of Arthur, Robin Hood, and Orlando, but the real Europe of plagues, political struggles, religious wars, witch hunts, and roving companies of soldiery forever ravaging the countryside. Unfortunately, he doesn't compare very well to them, either. His intrigue is not as interesting as Cicero's, Machiavelli's, Enguerrand de Coucy's--or even Sallust's, who was practically writing fiction, anyways. Some might suggest it unfair to compare a piece of fiction to a true history, but these are the same histories that lent Howard, Leiber, and Moorcock their touches of verisimilitude. Martin might have taken a lesson from them and drawn inspiration from further afield: even Tolkien had his Eddas. Despite being fictionalized and dramatized, Martin's take on The War of the Roses is far duller than the original.More than anything, this book felt like a serial melodrama: the hardships of an ensemble cast who we are meant to watch over and sympathize with, being drawn in by emotional appeals (the hope that things will 'get better' in this dark place, 'tragic' deaths), even if these appeals conflict with the supposed realism, and in the end, there is no grander story to unify the whole. This 'grittiness' is just Martin replacing the standard fantasy theme of 'glory' with one of 'hardship', and despite flipping this switch, it's still just an emotional appeal. 'Heroes always win' is just as blandly predictable as 'heroes always lose'.It's been suggested that I didn't read enough of Martin to judge him, but if the first four hundred pages aren't good, I don't expect the next thousand will be different. If you combine the three Del Rey collections of Conan The Barbarian stories, you get 1,263 pages (including introductions, end notes, and variant scripts). If you take Martin's first two books in this series, you get 1,504 pages. Already, less than a third of the way into the series, he's written more than Howard's entire Conan output, and all I can do is ask myself: why does he need that extra length?A few authors use it to their advantage, but for most, it's just sprawling, undifferentiated bloat. Melodrama can be a great way to mint money, as evidenced by the endless 'variations on a theme' of soap operas, pro wrestling, and superhero comics. People get into it, but it's neither revolutionary nor realistic. You also hear the same things from the fans: that it's all carefully planned, all interconnected, all going somewhere. Apparently they didn't learn their lesson from the anticlimactic fizzling out of Twin Peaks, X-Files, Lost, and Battlestar. Then again, you wouldn't keep watching if you didn't think it was going somewhere.Some say'at least he isn't as bad as all the drivel that gets published in genre fantasy', but saying he's better than dreck is really not very high praise. Others have intimated that I must not like fantasy at all, pointing to my low-star reviews of Martin,Wolfe,Jordan, andGoodkind, but it is precisely because I am passionate about fantasy that I fall heavily on these authors.A lover of fine wines winces the more at a corked bottle of vinegar, a ballet enthusiast's love of dance would not leave him breathless at a high school competition--and likewise, having learned to appreciate epics, histories, knightly ballads, fairy tales, and their modern offspring in fantasy, I find Martin woefully lacking. There's plenty of grim fantasy and intrigue out there, from its roots to the dozens of fantasy authors, both old and modern, whom I list in the link at the end of this reviewThere seems to be a sense that Martin's work is somehow revolutionary, that it represents a 'new direction' for fantasy, but all I see is a reversion. Sure, he's different than Jordan, Goodkind, and their ilk, who simply took the pseudo-medieval high-magic world from Tolkien and the blood-and-guts heroism from Howard. Martin, on the other hand, has more closely followed Tolkien's lead than any other modern high fantasy author--and I don't just mean in terms ofracism.Tolkien wanted to make his story real--not 'realistic', using the dramatic techniques of literature--but actually real, by trying to create all the detail of a pretend world behind the story. Over the span of the first twenty years, he released The Hobbit, the Lord of the Rings, and other works, while in the twenty years after that, he became so obsessed with worldbuilding for its own sake that instead of writing stories, hefilled his shed with a bunch of notes(which his son has been trying to make a complete book from ever since).It's the same thing Martin's trying to do: cover a bland story with a litany of details that don't contribute meaningfully to his characters, plot, or tone. So, if Martin is good because he is different, then it stands to reason that he's not very good, because he's not that different. He may seem different if all someone has read is Tolkien and the authors who ape his style, but that's just one small corner of a very expansive genre. Anyone who thinks Tolkien is the 'father of fantasy' doesn't know enough about the genre to judge what 'originality' means.So, if Martin neither an homage nor an original, I'm not sure what's left. In his attempt to set himself apart, he tore out the joyful heart of fantasy, but failed replace it with anything. There is no revolutionary voice here, and there is nothing in Martin's book that has not been done better by other authors.However, there is one thing Martin has done that no other author has been able to do: kill the longrunning High Fantasy series. According to some friends of mine in publishing (and some on-the-nose remarks by Caleb Carr in an NPR interview on his own foray into fantasy), Martin's inability to deliver a book on time, combined with his strained relationship with his publisher means that literary agents are no longer accepting manuscripts for high fantasy series--even from recognized authors. Apparently, Martin is so bad at plot structure that he actuallypre-emptively ruined books by other authors. Perhaps it is true what they say about silver linings . . .Though I declined to finish this book, I'll leave you with a caution compiled from various respectable friends of mine who did continue on:""If you need some kind of closure, avoid this series. No arcs will ever be completed, nothing will ever really change. The tagline is 'Winter is Coming'--it's not. As the series goes on, there will be more and more characters and diverging plotlines to keep track of, many of them apparently completely unrelated to each other, even as it increasingly becomes just anothercliche, fascist 'chosen one' monomyth, like every other fantasy series out there. If you enjoy a grim, excessively long soap opera with lots of deaths and constant unresolved tension, pick up the series--otherwise, maybe check out the show.""My Fantasy Book Suggestions",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13496.A_Game_of_Thrones,A Game of Thrones.txt
Memories of Ice,"A true masterpiece of the genre.IfGardens of the Moon(however ambitious)was a sloppy introduction with narrative obstructions that prevented shiny and glossy entry into the series, then duo ofDeadhouse Gateswith its emotional wrestling andMemories of Icewith its flawless execution, were determined in their goal to win you over for eternity.In my opinion, this is Erikson’s best book. And the words I would use to describe it are:perfectly balanced.Sufficiently developed newly introduced characters, engulfed with spry sense of humor - something that will from now on stand as Erikson’s strongest trademark and the main reason why are we falling in love with these characters in the first place(beside their bottomless depth, of course);deep and compelling story, that, while a continuation of the first book, also successfully juggles the parallel story of the second one - all while further progresses in building the world, without actually overwhelming the reader.On the contrary. While it may seem as too long while reading it, by the end of this book, it will compel you wishing for more pages for you to explore.Story.“Forces of nature are indifferent to justice. Thus it fails to us sentient beings, no matter how unworthy, to impose the moral divide.”Link to enlargeLink to enlargeWe’re back on the continent ofGenabackis,land which parts everyone are opportunistically claiming, be that under the banners of conquest or liberation. And as often in real life, as two sides are battling, third one emerges conquering everything before them, unopposed.Atrocities they commit are so vast that two opposing sides now have to join in order to stop them.Although it helps thatHigh Fist Dujek Onearm,leader ofMalazaninvading army, is now turned renegade byEmpress Laseen,which seemingly should help forming a pact with his former foes,Caladan BroodandAnomander Rake.Ha!On their opposing side, far in the south in the land ofPanion Domin,priest turned king -Panion Seerrises armies, armies which includes theTenescowri,a peasant horde, driven by famine, who in their cannibalistic tendencies, leave nothing and no-one to spare.Two sides will meet on the plains before the city ofCapustan,but not before the Tenescowri try to‘resupply’in the city itself.Hence the long siege of Capustan - a thrilling battle of survival - begins.I’ll have to say that, for me, the siege of Capustan, with hundreds of thousands of psychotically murderous cannibals turned warriors- who assail city gates -and just a handful thousands ofGrey Swordmercenaries and brave few citizens- who defend it -is most staggering battle sequence, not just of the book or the series, but in the genre as a whole.Because this isn’t just a battle of people and of their swords on swords and flesh on flesh – this isn’t a battle of violence by its design.This is a battle of humanity. Preserving one.The battle when everything is lost; when your body reacts mechanically and by its memory; when fog of war threatens to blind you to commit same amount of atrocities in the name of perverse justice(or in this case vengeance)– to show a compassion.And most importantly:the battle in you, to find it.But above everything else, this book is about motherhood.Oh yes. Here comes a paragraph or two aboutMhybe.Interestingly enough, same like withFelisin’sstory of her bravery inDeadhouse Gates,book which preceded this one, in all my previous reads, I would never properly focus on a story of Mhybe’s motherhood.I mean, there are battles and conflicts larger than life, characters that veer into dragons, amazing crew of soldiers you want to hang out with and witty wizards you secretly want to become yourself.So, of course, whenever story derails from that cast of characters, I would protest internally.But, maybe, there comes a time when your approach to the same book you have read so many times before slightly changes. You grow as a reader, and along these lines, you are driven by something else; you seek, from that same book, something different.And this is why I think highly and appreciate this series so much. Five, four and three years ago when I was reading this book first, second and third time, I wasn’t even aware that a story about motherhood can be this interesting and this prominent among all these other amazing stories.And the reason that I keep this series so high above everything else in this genre, is that I can come back to it, and after so many reads, still find something that will make this fourth reading experience as new and as emotional as first one.But, I have to say that this isn’t the first time that I noticed the significance of Mhybe in this series.I had a happy childhood and I’m coming from a happy family. I was fortunate enough to be surrounded by a motherly love, and in my close vicinity, all of my friends had a similar experience.So, having a mother who has a love in abundance and was willing to sacrifice herself for her child was a standard. A normal thing. Something that makes you human. Anything less than that was abnormal to me.Right?And then came Mhybe. A character through which I realized that this series goes way deeper than dragons, awesome battles and glorifying deaths. That this series explores parts of human nature we’re not accustomed to, not just exploring, but maybe even understanding.There was a beautiful young girl, full of life, beloved in her tribe, a girl soon to become a woman, eagerly preparing to marry one of many of her suitors.But then, she was chosen to become a vessel; a vessel which through magic would be impregnated with none other than two shattered souls, one beyond death and other held back from it through ancient sorceries, two identities braided together – a vessel that would be used to feed the unnatural child thus created.So, among herRhivitribe, a vessel that would be used as a container for this singular purpose – after which it would be discarded – is called Mhybe.She birthed a child, with no father, a child that came from her womb, but had none of her personality, none of her resemblance, a child she could not call her own.A magical child that, through sorcery, grew too fast, sorcery that demanded power, power found nowhere else than in the strength of the woman who gave this child a life, a life given for a life taken.Taken, but so, so slowly, and through such pain.You see, as this child so unnaturally grew older, so did unnaturally grew her mother.And soon, in a matter of months, as she witnessed her child becoming a 10, then a 15, then a 30 year old, Mhybe exponentially grew older; and she became a young woman trapped in a body of an old person, feeling all the aches of an old age. A girl weathered without the gift of years – old without the wisdom.So, knowing all this, and driven by my own experience I have already mentioned – fully expecting that whatever the case in this story, mother is there to love and support and care and even sacrifice herself for her child – it came as nothing but a complete shock when I read Mhybe saying this:“She has stolen my life!I am naught but bones and leather skin, I am naught but endless aches. Dried brittle – each moment of this terrible existence, and I edge closer to… to…She has stolen my life…”And it shocked me even more that I actually understood her. This mother that resents – no, this mother that actually hates her own child; this abnormal thing for me growing up, given how I was raised and how I viewed the world.I understood her.The fact that Erikson managed to do so, through a character in his book, was enough of a proof how this is on entirely different level than the rest of authors in this genre.And to this day, with all the flaws in this series, and all the love some of the far more lovable series in this genre get, I’m unable to find anywhere else repeating of this exact same thing; wakening of emotions - or at least rising awareness - I didn't know I could have while reading a book.Worldbuilding, History and Lore.As mentioned in reviews for previous books, Gods have an active role in shaping various outcomes.They like to meddle, to pry; they are, as humans tend to be, prone to squabbles, insecurities and vengeance. And not necessarily because there’s abundance of boredom in their Pantheon, no. Most of them are simply vile and vicious creatures. But, since they are all part of Pantheon, there are rules everyone has to abide to.(Or at least everyone who hasn’t found a way to cheat those rules.)The Deck of Dragons.Deck of Dragons is essentially an accurate representation of Pantheon.A kind of structure, imposed on power itself and more importantly, imposition of order.Each card is a gate into aWarren.Before Warrens(realm and source of magic in this world),before magic was refined in elementalPathswhich could be manipulated in current state through those Warrens, there wereHouses.(And even before them there wereHolds.And even before that –WanderingthroughChaos.)And structure of those Houses is something like this:High House represents God’s little realm. And there are multiple High Houses.High House of LifeandHigh House of Death. High House of DarkandHigh House of Lightetc.In those houses structure has its own order. So every House has their rulers,KingsandQueens.They have their loyal subjects such asKnights, Heralds, Priests, Masons, Virgins,etc.Each has their own role in the house and each has their own card in Deck of Dragons.One way to make sure Gods and their loyal subjects behave in borders of their malice or vanity is through Deck of Cards, or throughMaster of the Deck,who can basically make his own rules, who can grant or decline permission to a House’s existence.“Players in the game, wanting no others. Players outside the game and wanting in.Players to the forefront and ones behind, moving in the shadows.Players who play fair, players who cheat.”In this book we are finally introduced toThe Fallen One, The Crippled God.His story is that he’s an alien entity, brought down to the Malazan earth to be shackled. Reasons for that, so far are unknown. We’ll have to trust Gods who are saying that at some point he presented a threat to the world. Yes, those same vicious and vile Gods, yes. I know.So, cyclically, when one Pantheon ceases to exist and a new one arises, they chain him again and again, leaving him in his broken and crippled form.Now, you may ask:“Well, since he’s a God, why isn’t he in a Pantheon with the rest of them?”Good question.It’s a demanding book. And if by chance, by each passing book, it becomes less demanding – it doesn’t necessarily mean that Erikson lost an edge or that he’s trying to make it easier for you.No. It would probably mean that you’re becoming more demanding reader.And he delivers.4.25/5Kharkanas TrilogyForge of DarknessFall of LightPath to Ascendancy seriesDancer's LamentDeadhouse LandingMalazan Empire seriesNight Of KnivesMalazan Book of the Fallen seriesGardens of the MoonDeadhouse GatesUltimate Malazan Chronological Reading Order",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/175983.Memories_of_Ice,Memories of Ice.txt
Eragon,"A short (and somewhat sarcastic) summary: Main character = Eragon, mysteeeeerious boy-child left with his aunt and uncle by wandering mother, father unknown. Boy finds mysteeeeerious stone. Turns out to be dragon egg. Boy raises dragon and bonds with it strongly. Bad guys come and destroy boy's house and kill his uncle. Boy swears revenge. Boy's secret dragon is discovered by mysteeeerious storyteller who turns out to be master swordsman and random magic user. The hunt for the bad guys begins, and boy searches for his destiny as a legendary Dragon Rider (of course, that must be capitalized). Eragon goes through traditional bouts of training and learning about himself under the stern tutelage of old wise traveling companion. Along the way he gains and loses friends, and rescues a mysteeeerious woman from a horrible dungeon while never straying from his quest to put right all that is wrong in a world oppressively ruled by an evil king.This book has gotten lots of attention since it first came out, partly because the author is so young. He was fifteen when he started the book, and was nineteen when it was published. Age isn't always correlated with mastery, of course, but when I read this book, I could TELL that the writer was either young or an immature writer. Though it seems people think it ""got published"" somehow because of its great merit, this book was actually self-published by the author's parents (company was Paolini International), and then it was paraded around on a self-funded signing tour the way most self-published people do. An established author happened to run into the family doing a signing while he was on vacation, thought a kid writing a book was interesting, bought a copy and made his stepson read it, and decided to try to get the book a deal when the kid liked it. The people at Knopf re-edited and repackaged and re-released it under that label. I believe that if this book had meandered its way to publishing houses the usual way, it would have been rejected as unpublishable, for reasons I will discuss in depth here.Christopher Paolini himself, in his own words, describes his story thus: ""Eragon is an archetypal hero story, filled with exciting action, dangerous villains, and fantastic locations. There are dragons and elves, sword fights and unexpected revelations, and of course, a beautiful maiden who's more than capable of taking care of herself.""I would argue that this book is not an ""archetypal hero story"" so much as an overused and overly traditional Tolkienien ""epic,"" with ""epic"" in quotes because it lacks exactly that epic nature that made the world of Lord of the Rings so rich. There was absolutely nothing new or ""unexpected"" in this book (though the author claims there are ""revelations""), and if a reader is excited by this book, they are probably reacting to the concepts themselves (e.g., fantasy worlds, dragons, fierce battles) rather than the book's own merit, or perhaps they have never been exposed to the dozens of fantasy and science fiction epics from which this author pulled his influences. My feeling was that this book was nothing special because, if I may be so blunt, ""it's been done,"" and it's been done better.Overall, I just think that this book was written as though it had a template or blueprint for ""traditional fantasy novel"" and the details and names were simply filled in. I couldn't help feeling the entire time I was reading it that I had read this story before, nothing was much of a surprise, and things that didn't make sense or got in the way of a conflicting original vision were smoothed over with excuses or deliberate muddling of motives. I think that in order to write something so traditional, a writer needs something special, a unique twist or slant, and this just hasn't got it. (In other words, I'm not saying that writing an ""archetypal fantasy epic"" is BAD; I'm saying that it needs to not be a rehashing of overused themes that have been done to death by classic writers.) The boy and his powerful companion having an intimate relationship? Done, in everything from Anne McCaffrey to freakingDigimon. The hero quest to punish the baddies and bring the good guys back into power? Done, inLord of the RingsandStar Wars. Lush descriptions of landscapes and surroundings? Done by Tolkien of course, but more as a background to action rather than in stagnant heaps of detail. Mysterious companions to whom there is more than meets the eye? I don't even want to think about all the books and movies that have done that. I can't pick out a single thing that this book has that has never been done before, the characters didn't interest or capture me, the storytelling was riddled with too many attempts to be grand that I was just entirely turned off by it.Some specifics about the bad writing style:Every imaginable permutation of the word ""said"" is used. If the reader cannot tell how someone is saying something by what they are saying, it is likely that the dialogue has been written sloppily. ""'You're not thinking,' admonished Brom."" Yes, that is an admonishment without you telling us so. Leave it out. ""'Get on with the story,' he said impatiently."" Well, if one person is urging another to get on with it, it stands to reason that it's being said impatiently. Running into ""'Sorry,' apologized Brom"" made me cringe. The fact that Brom said ""Sorry"" means that he apologized, so use ""said."" You can deviate from ""said"" if for some reason HOW the sentence is said is not obvious, such as volume (""he whispered"") or intent (""he said sarcastically,"" if it isn't obvious that that's a sarcastic comment anyway). Leave out the decorations because they're tacky. The speech tags are not the part of the writing that is supposed to be interesting, so don't distract us; believe me when I say that if you do it, nearly any editor will consider it an early warning sign that you are an amateur.Unnecessary description is inserted with maddening frequency. I am not usually a reader of traditional fantasy, and traditional fantasy does tend to be more flowery than the hard stuff, but either way random descriptions should not just be thrown into the mix. Eragon is waking up and stretching. Suddenly we get a description of the items on his night table, including the random information that he likes to look at one of the objects on it frequently. In the meantime, while we are getting this rush of information, Eragon is putting on his shoes. He then does not proceed to touch, pick up, or look at anything on the night table, and none of it is ever mentioned again. Also, people and places just get sudden paragraphs of description. We're fighting an Urgal and all of a sudden . . . drop some description on us. While he's rushing at Eragon with drooling fangs, no less. By all means, describe the fangs, slipping the adjectives in gracefully. But don't give us a run-down of a typical Urgal when we're a lot more interested in whether those fangs are going into Eragon's head.And lastly, too many words, phrases, and concepts seem to be entirely lifted from other well-known works. Word choice seemed as though it was the author's attempt to use all his SAT words; it was verbose and flowery as if on purpose, trying to impress with vocabulary that would have been better used sparingly. The similarity of some people's and places' names to those of Tolkien have not gone unnoticed by seasoned fantasy readers; I have heard several people call this book ""Aragorn"" without even noticing that they weren't saying it right, not to mention things like Ardwen (compared with Arwen), Isenstar (compared with Isengard), and Isidar (compared with Isildur)--and there are a LOT more. A ridiculous number of phrases seem to be something I've heard before, though I'm not sure where; for example, near the beginning someone is touching a wrapped package repeatedly, ""as if to reassure herself that it was still there."" I mentioned this to a friend and said, ""That's FROM something."" He replied, ""It's FROM everything!"" Far too often, ridiculously overused or clichéd similes and metaphors are used, such as tears being described as ""liquid diamonds."" It is less like this book was written and more like it was sewn together from the torn apart products of others, like some old quilt on which the stitches are showing. (How's that for an original simile?)There's definitely not enough space in this little box (which has a character limit) for me to go into as much detail as I'd like talking about how bad this book is, so if you really want to read my ranting in all its entirety, you might want to check out myessay about iton my website.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/113436.Eragon,Eragon.txt
The Lies of Locke Lamora,"”Some day, Locke Lamora,” he said, “some day, you’re going to fuck up so magnificently, so ambitiously, so overwhelmingly that the sky will light up and the moons will spin and the gods themselves will shit comets with glee. And I just hope I’m still around to see it.”“Oh please,” said Locke. “It’ll never happen.”Haha! You gotta love Father Chains for his vivid imagination and if you actually read the entire book you might find yourself at a place where you have to agree with him. XDBut I’m getting ahead of myself here so I’ll just start with my general opinion and will try to take it from there. ;-)This book was amazing! I’m the first to admit that it had a rather slow start and that Scott Lynch put a lot of effort into his world building, the more I read on the more I could understand why he was so thorough with his descriptions though. He set the stage, let us see how Locke’s crew operated, gave us a good understanding about their close bond and offered us a brief glimpse at the machinations behind all their elaborate heists. In short: Lynch wrote a brilliant opening to an intriguing series and I can’t wait to read book two.If there are at least half as many twists and unexpected turns as there were in“The Lies of Locke Lamora”I’ll be a more than just happy camper. *lol* I mean seriously, I loved all those characters and their cunning and deceiving ways. XD Throughout the entire book I never knew what to expect and there were about a ton of“Oh, shit!”moments that were shortly followed by“Jeez! NO!”and“What happened now?”exclamations. I confess that some of the happenings and casual revelations actually left me reeling and I found myself saying: “That’s it! That’s exactly what I want to read!” more often than I can count. And boy did the shit hit the fan at the middle of the book. I barely got a second to breathe and I continued to be breathless until the crescendo ended in a grande finale and the curtain eventually fell.Yes, the second half of the book wasTHATintense. *lol*Anyway, enough of musical terms! Let’s go right to the characters! ;-)The Characters:Welcome to Camorr, the city that harbours questionable characters, morally grey individuals and a wide selection of rich nobles that quite literally beg to be robbed and spoiled. If you’re an innocent and clueless noble you better don’t dwell all too long. You might either end up relieved of the weight of your purse or even worse, you might end up being spoiled for the book! This was a fair warning; the rest is up to you. ;-PFather Chains:”There are only three people in life you can never fool – pawnbrokers, whores, and your mother. Since your mother’s dead, I’ve taken her place. Hence, I’m bullshit-proof.”I really loved that guy! His observations and statements were so funny and accurate and boy was he a clever man. I mean he basically invented “The Gentleman Bastards” and made them the crew they are when we first set eyes on them. He might have been harsh to his boys but it was obvious that he only wanted the best for them and I guess in his own way he really cared about them too. I can’t help but wonder what happened to him though. We only read about him in flashbacks and memories so it’s kind of self-explanatory that he’s dead. How exactly he died was never mentioned though. Maybe this mystery will be solved in book two and we’ll find out more about Sabetha too?? She’s still such a mystery. XDLocke Lamora:”You’re one third bad intentions, one third pure avarice, and one eight sawdust. What’s left, I’ll credit, must be brains.”JThat’s Jean’s description of Locke and to some degree I have to agree with his words. *lol* I think Locke is definitely a whole lot more brains than he gave him credit for though. I really loved this character! He might be a thief but he was a gentleman too and he had his heart at the right place which is the most important thing. For Locke it never was about the money, it was all about the fun he had with his heists and brothers. You might say it was the scheming and plotting that made him happy. To create a plan and to actually execute it in the end. The money they gained from it was just secondary. Locke’s character arc was really intriguing because at the beginning it’s all about the heist and the fun, but the moment the Grey King appears everything changes and gets dark. Well, and after the Grey King took away the only thing he ever cared about his heart and mind are set on vengeance and vengeance alone. I’ve to admit that I loved that angry Locke too and the more I read about his complex character the more I loved him.”If he was going to save them, he had to play the Grey King until the Capa was finished with him, and then he would pray for a quick and easy death. Let Locke Lamora just vanish one night; let his friends slip away to whatever better fate awaited them.””I will have the Grey King, and if all the powers of Camorr and Karthain and Hell itself oppose me, it will be nothing – nothing but a longer trail of corpses between me and your master.”Jean Tannen:”Hell yes,” cried Bug. “I knew there was a reason I let you lead this gang!”“Well, I can’t argue with the manifest wisdom of the boy that jumps off temple roofs. But I trust my points are noted,” said Jean.“Very noted,” said Locke. “Received, recognised, and duly considered with the utmost gravity. Sealed, notarised, and firmly imprinted upon my rational essence.”I loved the bond between Jean and Locke! I don’t know how it happened that they got so close but it was obvious that they are like family to each other. After reading the entire book I have the feeling that I still don’t know Jean all too well but I’m pretty sure Scott Lynch had his reasons to keep his character vague. Maybe we’ll read more about him in the next book and I’d be totally fine with this. Alone the fact that he’s quite literally Locke’s “hatchet man” was enough to make me curious and I truly hope my curiosity will be sated in the next book. =)”I don’t have to fight or run,” he crackled. “I changed the rules of the game. I just have to keep you here … asshole. Here … until … Jean gets back.”The Sanza Twins:”If you do end up in danger, Locke,” said Calo, “you must understand that we will ignore the orders of our garrista, and we’ll bludgeon our friend on the back of his thick skull and smuggle him out of Camorr in a box. I have just the bludgeon for the job.”“And I have a box,” said Galdo. “Been hoping for an excuse to use it for years, really.”Those two were so amazing! They grew on me so fast and then the ending happened and I was likeNOOOOOOO!!!It’s so rare to read about twins in books and I really would have loved to see more of them. Unfortunately it seems like Scott Lynch had other plans and the funny Sanza twins had to disappear. T_T I loved that they would have done everything in order to save Locke and I know he loved them very much. =( I swear I cried real tears when he found them dead at the temple. It broke my heart… They would have deserved so much better than that. Locke was true to his word though, he really made them and Bug the biggest death offering Camorr ever saw and I love him even more for it! <3”And I had to get rid of the moustache in a hurry,” said Locke.“And damned if he didn’t scream when Jean did the honours,” said Calo.“Like a Sanza brother in an empty whorehouse!” Locke made a rude gesture at Calo; Calo mimed aiming and loosing a crossbow at him in return.The Grey King:”But you could have settled for simple theft,” said Locke. “I would have given it all to keep Calo and Galdo and Bug alive. I would have given it all, had you put it to me like that.”“What thief does not fight to hold what he has?”“One that has something better,” said Locke.I really disliked the Grey King and the Bondsmage made my blood boil with anger! They were both such arrogant and self-righteous numpties! I swear when Locke decided to take them down I cheered for him and even though he had to pay a high price for his actions I still think it was worth it. Bug, Calo and Galdo were worth it. I think what shook me the most about the Grey King and his lackey was the simple fact that they just did it because they could. I mean Locke never did them any harm, yet they destroyed his entire life and killed the people he cared about. It was so senseless. The Bondsmage obviously enjoyed to have the power over other people and relished to torture on behalf of the Grey King, so I have absolutely no pity for him. Was it drastic what Locke and Jean did? Yes! Was it wrong? Yes, definitely. Did the Grey King and the Bondsmage deserve it? I’m inclined to say yes, because let’s face it if Locke and Jean wouldn’t have done what they did their lives would have been forfeit the moment the Bondsmage got rid of his shackles. I think they actually didn’t have any other choice if they wanted to survive. >_<The Spider:”I have always found the presumptions of others to be the best possible disguise – haven’t you?”Ha! I knew who the spider was the moment she appeared! It was a clever disguise but not clever enough to fool me. XD I’m just glad that she believed Locke and listened to him and I think they made an interesting pair. What I loved the most about their interactions was their mutual respect though. They could appreciate the skill of each other even though they lived in totally different worlds and were enemies. It was nice to see that Locke’s opponent was as cunning and artful as he was and it gave the story a really nice touch. Whilst the Grey King was all brutality and cruel force in the end, the spider remained conniving and prudent and I really liked that about her.Conclusion:This plane might have taken quite a while until it took off, but boy, did it take off in the end! The more I think about it the more I have to admit that this story was brilliantly executed and I can only take a bow and congratulate Scott Lynch for writing such a complex, detailed and elaborate book! =)____________________________________It’s another month and since March just started I’m once again trying to reduce my TBR with my own blog meme“Hugs’n’kisses OR Dismissed by the Missus/Messrs”.This time around I chose“The Lies of Locke Lamora”and I’m so happy I’m finally going to read this book.I wanted to read it for ages but never had the time and now that I did my monthly blog meme I have no other choice than to go through with it – Which, truth be told, is awesome! *lol*An infamous thief, his morally gray gang and a dangerous and bloody coup?Say no more, because I’m so here for this! ;-P",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29588376-the-lies-of-locke-lamora,The Lies of Locke Lamora.txt
Babel,"“Babel, Or the Necessity of Trauma Porn”I can talk about the many problems I had with this book in terms of its length, its structure, its utterly paper-thin characters, and how goddamnedcondescendingit is, and you can find that discussion below. But I feel that I should start with the part of this book that broke me.There’s a concept often floated around when people talk about how to portray bigotry and prejudice in fiction, and it’s the concept that in portraying racist (or queerphobic, ableist, etc.) violence, authors should take care not to do so in a way that is traumatic to the audience who might share that identity. Otherwise, such a portrayal begins to feel like trauma porn for the majority, not an empowering or cathartic narrative for the marginalized.Babelfeels like trauma porn. It is an unceasing stream of racism and racist violence against its characters of color.Kuang’s commitment to showing racism is so intense that she even throws consistency out the window for the sake of it. In one chapter, Robin is described as having the same eye shape as his white father. Inliterally the next chapter, he’s made fun of for having narrow East Asian eyes.Kuang. What is the truth here? They can’tbothbe correct.I’m 100% sure the rejoinder here would be “well, the racism is historically accurate.” I haven’t studied this time period, so I’m not going to engage in any discussions about historical accuracy. But I will point out that “historical accuracy” is not an unassailable argument because historical accounts are never neutral, because the writer chose what to record and what to omit. And—aside from the fact that this book is historicalfantasy, anyways—any work of fiction is composed of a series of intentional choices on the part of the author.(Tangentially, I would also like to point out that RF Kuang has no experiences with anti-Blackness or the racism a brown Indian Muslim would face, so I’m not sure what gives her the confidence to delve so deeply into those descriptions.)So I ask: What is the purpose of this book? The people who don’t understand that Racism Is Bad are not going to be reading this book. The people who already agree that racism and colonization are bad are just going to have this message beaten into their heads by RF Kuang’s literary equivalent of a sledgehammer, because RF Kuang treats her audience as idiots who are incapable of understanding anything for themselves.I’m speaking as an Asian American who does not usually consider anti-Asian racism a personal trigger. I’m speaking as someone who has loved plenty of books that have racism as their central theme:Ace of Spadesby Faridah Abike-Iyimide,Legendbornby Tracy Deonn,Disorientationby Elaine Hsieh Chou.But I foundBabelsimply too exhausting and too depressing to read past the 55% mark. After reading “Chinese people are inherently dirty and lazy and inferior” for the dozenth time, I did not feel enlightened or filled with righteous anger against anti-Asian racism.I felt that RF Kuang had done the literary equivalent of beating me black and blue with a hammer, and I gave up, because my mental health is worth far more than this book.*I have plenty of criticisms ofBabelon a craft level, enough that I’m honestly astonished that it has been so well received when it, in many ways, feels like a massive step back from The Poppy War trilogy.Longer is not always better; or, the pacing of this book was all over the place and the characters are flatter than paper cutouts.Fantasy authors who have just written their first book are discouraged from throwing every single cool idea they have into one manuscript and ending up with a 200K+ word behemoth that they swear they cannot cut down. “Kill your darlings,” and all that. But despite not being a debut,Babelfeels so excessively long and self-indulgent. It felt like Kuang showing off every 1830s reference she could possibly cram into the book to shove her research in the reader’s face. Kuang crams in references to historical events and narrates them with the style of the driest history textbook imaginable. This book was just soexhausting, not just to read, but even to listen to on audiobook (despite the narrator’s fantastic performance).Simultaneously, none of the length is spent on what actuallymatters. The characters are so one-dimensional, as if they mainly exist as canvases for racist violence to be done to them (or for spouting racism, in the case of Letty). Robin doesn’t have any emotional reaction to meeting another Chinese person for the first time in six years—someone who is also hisfamily member—for example.In general, I don’t understand why Robin Swift was the protagonist of this book. He had virtually no personality; he feels more like a puppet than a real person. The motivations he has for going either with or against the Hermes Society (the group that is opposed to Babel and the British Empire) feel so incredibly weak. He is never given the opportunity to come to the conclusion that Babel is bad on his own; no, he has to betold, after a mereone dayat Oxford, by the Hermes Society that Babel is evil and therefore Robin should join the rebellion. In her haste to make sure the readers all know Racism And Colonization Are Bad, RF Kuang robs Robin of the ability to drive the plot of this book. Instead, he’s swept along by the convictions of others, and his character suffers as a result.This same creative choice also destroys what seemed to be RF Kuang’s original intention: trying to portray academia as an alluring, magical world that students want to be a part of, only to eventually realize its rotten underpinnings. Robin doesn’t have any time to fall in love with Oxford after asingleday (no, I’m not counting the three or so days he spent with Ramy before classes started, because you can’t love academia if you haven’t even taken a single class?) before the Hermes Society comes along and tells him Babel Is Evil.A more compelling narrative choice would have been to have the Hermes Society prompt Robin to investigate Babel and come to the realization himself that the institution he loves is supported by colonization and racism—which also would have given Robin some sorely needed agency and character development. Not to mention it would have added tension and propulsion to the plot, which often feels like it’s plodding along without anything to move it forward other than Robin’s need to graduate, until the Hermes Society pops up again at random. As it is, there is so little tension in this book; RF Kuang never withholds information when she has the chance to remind us that Racism Is Bad.Speaking of Robin, I’m not convinced his representation as a biracial person is all that good. This isn’t my lane, so I don’t want to harp on it too much (and would welcome ownvoices perspectives), but it didn’t strike me as plausible that he could pass both for a white person and for a non-biracial Chinese person.There’s a reason “show don’t tell” is taught to amateur writers; or, the book treats readers as idiots.I absolutelycould not stand how condescending RF Kuang was in this book.From her author’s note at the start, I had a bad feeling. It comes off as aggressive, “don’t you dare question my portrayal of Oxford.” And look, if it had been written as a neutral explanation instead of a manifesto—“Here are the places I deviated from exact history and these are my reasons why”—it would have been fine. Interesting, even.But as it is, it really sets the tone for the rest of the book.There is so. Much. Telling. Kuang doesn’t trust any of her readers to understand what she’s saying; no, she has to follow up with an explicit explanation that This Is Bad. Imagine a movie adaptation of this book showing Robin physically beaten by his guardian and then immediately having a voice-over explaining that this behavior was Abusive And Bad. That’s exactly what RF Kuang does with narration.Because apparently we are all idiots, since none of us have two master’s degrees and a PhD from Yale.(I also have to point out that RF Kuang explaining that she wanted to portray oysters as delicacies inBabel, despite that being historically inaccurate, simply because oysters were a delicacy to her when she was as Oxford, not only smacks of the highest degree of self-centeredness but also makes me question her integrity as a historian. Theinterestingpart about writing historical fiction is trying to understand what is the same and what is different from the modern day, not assuming people lived the same way back then as they do now.)RF Kuang wants us to believe that Robin loves his cohort (Ramy, Letty, and Victoire), but she justtellsus this instead of showing us. The “found family” aspect felt incredibly weak, especially since Letty feels like a stock “racist white girl” stand-in. I could not buy the idea that the four of them viewed each other as family when three of them are people of color and Letty kept saying racist things to the rest of them. I nearly laughed at the part where Letty was supposed to be in love with Ramy, the brown Indian Muslim man who is constantly mad at her for saying things like the British had the right to be in India.Speaking of romance, at least in the first 55% of this book, Robin and Ramy’s relationship is soweak, with absolutely zero chemistry, that I would flat-outforgetthat Robin and Ramy were anything other than classmates for a hundred pages at a time until the book hit me over the head with a scene in neon lightstellingme “these two have Romantic Feelings for each other!” I don’t know if it improves later on, but I am disinclined to ever read a romance by RF Kuang when this one was so poorly written. (And I feel the need to point out that this isn’t the first time RF Kuang has shoved a poorly written gay romance into her books.)(I am once again begging people who are looking for queer romances to read the plenty of queer genre romances, in either traditional or indie publishing.)To quote another review—fuck the footnotes. They were either pieces of information that were critical to the story and therefore should not have even been footnotes, or extraneous pieces of backstory that should have been cut but RF Kuang just could not help herself from making this book as long as possible, or condescending “IN CASE YOU DIDN’T REALIZE, THIS PERSON IS RACIST” diatribes. RF Kuang writes as though she thinks her readers are children who can’t tell that she’s writing purposefully racist dialogue so she needs a footnote to explain.And yet, despite Kuang hammering in most of her messages with a sledgehammer to the reader’s skull, her portrayal of Letty is weirdly ambiguous. Despite the fact that Letty often says racist things (see: her opinion on the British in India above), her friends, who are all people of color, frequently defend her, so…what is the intent here?(I was especially dying when Victoire claimed solidarity with Letty because they were both women, while talking to Ramy,a brown man, and Robin. As if the misogyny experienced by white versus Black women isanythingalike. I’m sorry, but why has no one commented on this?)Superficial complexity, underlying plot holes; or, parts of the plot feels like it came out of a YA dystopian story.The most compelling part of the book, for me, was the fantasy element. Even then, there is a huge plot hole in the story. If silverworking only works for people who can “dream” in multiple languages,youcannotconvince me that both Professor Lovell and Professor Chakravarty, who learned Mandarin as a second language, are capable of dreaming in Mandarin when Griffin (Robin’s half-brother) can’t? If they could both learn Mandarin and become fluent enough to dream in it, why couldn’t they train Griffin to do the same? This is never explained.But the part that killed me the most was everything having to do with the Hermes Society.I cannot get over Robin being told that the Hermes Society has to be so careful because they’ll get tortured to death if Babel ever catches them, blah blah blah, while at the same time Hermes is hiring the literalworstcandidates to help them. Robin and his friends cannot lie to save their lives and get caught stealing from Babel, not once, but multiple times. And yet the Hermes Society was so keen to recruit them?At one point, Robin tells the Hermes Society he’s concerned that Babel’s security measures have been upgraded. Guess how they respond?A) “Oh damn, guess we’re going to have to reassess our plan since none of us want to get caught and tortured to death, like we told you we were afraid of before!”B) “Whatever. Everything will be fine. You’re being overly paranoid, Robin.”If you chose B, you were correct.I’m just. I’m lying on the floor here, staring at the ceiling and questioning my entire view of reality if this is the Adult fantasy that’s being called a “masterpiece.” I’ve seen far less ridiculous Adult fantasy books get ripped to shreds for being “too YA,” yet somehowBabelisn’t?ConclusionI tried, I really did, to reach the ending of this book, because I saw some spoilers in other reviews that I wanted to be able to discuss myself.I don’t agree that translation is inherently an act of violence. And I would have hadplentyto say about most of the characters of color dying in the end, including the two queer men of color.But I couldn’t. Because it’s not worth wasting any more of my time on this.As a work of fiction,Babellacks a compelling narrative due to its poor pacing and unbelievably flat characters. As a work of history,Babelcannot be considered as even anattemptat objectivity. Not when the text and the footnotes feel, as others have pointed out, like RF Kuang is breathing down your neck, telling you exactly what you’re supposed to think about the book instead of being a professor guiding students to form their own conclusions. (And because I have no chill anymore about this book, I’d like to state for the record that there is at least one instance of RF Kuang misconstruing real historical events in order to suit her narrative.)Do you know how much it takes to cancel an author for me personally? An author has to be a TERF or a racist or a queerphobe, basically.And yet, I never want to read an RF Kuang book again.If I wanted to be lectured at, I would go back to college/grad school. Except even most of my professors from law school didn’t treat their students like idiots who were incapable of understanding what they had to say.*mic drop*",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57945316-babel,Babel.txt
Monstrous Regiment,"Sanırım bugüne kadar okuduğum en iyi Terry Pratchett kitabı.Bu sefer Ankh-Morpork'un pek kavgacı komşusu Borogravia'ya gidiyor ve komşularıyla girdikleri savaşın hikayesine, erkek kılığına girerek askere yazılmış, kardeşini arayan bir genç kızın gözünden tanık oluyoruz.Kimi yönleriyle ilginç, kimi yönleriyle ise istemeyeceğimiz kadar tanıdık, boktan bir ülke Borogravia. Ekonomisi mutlak bir çöküşün arifesinde, artık neredeyse asker olacak sağlıklı bir popülasyonu kalmamış, yöneticisi muhtemelen ölmüş, kafayı üşütmüş tanrı Nuggan'ın zorlu yasakları altında yaşamaya çalışan ve devamlı savaşan bir ülke.Geleneklerine bağlı ve muhafazakar. Kadınların en fazla sabırsız bir tahammül umabileceği, her şeyin mantıksızlık bir süreklilikte yitip gittiği ama kurallara uymayan kadınları sadece bir inç kalınlığından daha ince sopalarla dövdükleri için gurur duyan ve iç bunaltıcı bir kabullenmişliğe teslim olmuş bir ülke ve topyekün kafayı yemiş bir halkın muhteşem birleşimi. Yani, elbette ""uyan anavatanın oğulları"" diye başlayan milli marşında bir süre doğa övülen, ardından da nasıl da güzel savaştıklarının anlatıldığı, zor bir ülke.Ve o Borogravia, bu sefer komşusu Zlobenia ile savaşıyor.""dünyanın her yerinde özgürlük aşığı halkların dostu olan Ankh-Morpork""da ekonomik sebeplerle tamamen ilgisiz bir biçimde özgürlük ve demokrasi getirmek adına bu savaşa müdahil oluyor.Üstelik Borogravia'nın dandik tanrısı da durumu hiç mi hiç kolaylaştırmıyor. Daha önceSon Kahramankitabında da gördüğümüz, Nuggan, tepesi dökük saçları, tuhaf bıyığı, kısa boyu ve piknik tüpünü andıran imajı ile açıkçasıDunmanifestin'in popüler çocuğu değil. Ve Klatch'ın Timsah Tanrısı Offler'ın hakkında ""bir tanrının asla böyle bir bıyığı olmamalı"" dediğini Nuggan, inananlarının ne yapması gerektiğiyle değil de ne yapmaması gerektiğiyle daha çok ilgilenen bir tanrı. Kutsal kitabını sıklıkla güncelleyen Nugan (kitabın sonunda ayrılmış olan boş sayfalarda yeni günahlar beliriyor) yapbozlar, sarımsak, çikolata, kediler, istiridyeler ve cücelerden sonra bebekler ve mavi rengi de günah ilan ettiğinden beri de kendi halkı tarafından da zorlukla tahammül edilen bir tanrı.Tatsız bir diyar burası uzun lafın kısası. Ve dünyamıza benzeyen ama benzemeyen bu fantastik diyarda savaş, cinsiyet rolleri, din, mizojini ve değişim hakkında bir kitap Canavar Alayı.Polly sorgulayan gözlerin kendisine saplandığını hissetti. Utanıyordu elbette. Ama aşikar sebepten dolayı değil. diğer sebepten utanıyordu, hayatın bazen döve döve öğrettiği küçük dersten dolayı: Dünyayı izleyen tek kişi sen değilsin. Başkaları da var; sen onları izlerken onlar da seni izliyor ve sen onlar hakkında düşünürken onlar da senin hakkında düşünüyor. Dünyada önemli olan tek kişi sen değilsin.Bu dünyanın ortasında ise Polly Perks var. Veya diğer ismiyle Oliver veya mangasındaki adıyla Ozzer veya üstlerinin deyimiyle Perks... Hem bir kargaşa hem de okyanusun ortasındaki demir bir çapa Polly. Adı gibi birçok kimliği de var ve yol boyu ince ince, küçük küçük nasıl değiştiğini, nasıl büyüdüğünü, nasıl bütün olduğunu veya nasıl parçaladığını izliyor an be an.Aslında ne savaşla, ne vatanseverlikle ilgilenen, sadece savaş sırasında kaybolmuş kardeşini bulmak isteyen bir genç kız. Ve bir gün artık saçlarını kesip, pantolonunun içine bir çorap tıkıştırıp askere yazılmaktan ve bu sanki asla bitmeyecekmiş gibi gözüken savaşın içinde kardeşini aramaktan başka çıkar yolu kalmadığını hissediyor. Çantasını topluyor ve çalıştığı hanın arka penceresinden gecenin karanlığına akıp, Borogravia ordusuna katılmak için civardaki bir diğer köyün hanının yolunu tutuveriyor.Hızlıca pantolonun içine sokulan çorapların şekillendirdiği bir dünyada buluyor kendini Polly. Önyargılarla, ayrımcılıkla, savaşla, cinsiyetçilikle dolu bir dünyada var olabilmek için, ne olduğunu bulabilmek için, kendini ve çevresini ve belki dünyayı değiştirmek için ama aslında sadece biraz aptal erkek kardeşini bulabilmek için, sadece kendisini saklamanın değil, beyniyle değil çoraplarla da düşünebilmesi gerektiğini fark ediyor büyük bir hızla.Polly'nin yoldaşları olan diğer acemiler ise tuhaf bir takım oluşturuyor. Tam bir kardeşler takımı olan grup Vampir Maladict, Troll Zımparataş, canavar alayının muharebe doktoru Igor, eşit derecede sessiz ve temkinli çocuklar olan Tonker, Shufti, Wazzer ve Lofty ve hepsinin başında ordunun adeta demirbaşı haline gelmiş Çavuş Jackrum'dan oluşuyor.Gerçekten tam bir çavuş Jackrum. Orduda sayısı bir türlü tam olarak tespit edilemeyen on yıllar harcamış ama bir şekilde terfi etmemiş, asker tanımının kirli bir tanımı adeta. Emrindeki askerlerin zarar görmemesi için her şeyi yapacak, sonuna gerçekten yolun sonuna kadar ""çocuklarını"" koruyacak ama aynı zamanda nasıl savaşılacağını bilen, elini kirletmekten zerre kaçınmayan, her durumda gereğini yapan bir karakter. Polly'nin başlangıç olduğu bir hikayede Jackrum adeta bir sonuç. Muazzam bir karakter.Jackrum'u General Patton'dan ödünç aldığı şu sözü en iyi tanımlıyor belki de:""Ben kitaplardan ve vatan için ölmekten falan hiç hoşlanmamışımdır ama işimin, karşımdaki şeytanın vatanı için ölmesini sağlamak olduğunu biliyorum.""Bu mükemmel kadroyu da akademinin parlak çocuğu, savaş alanı tarafından lekelenmemiş, kimi yönlerden tam bir embesil, kimi yönlerden ise yenilikçi, adeta orta karar bir üniversitenin mühendislik bölümünden yeni mezun Teğmen Bluz tamamlıyor. Ardından Canavar Alayı'nın gerçekliği hem ne kadar az hem de ne kadar çok etkilediğini izliyoruz Terry'nin rehberliğinde.""""Doğam gereği yalancı bir adam değilimdir Perks,"" dedi Bluz soğuk bir sesle.""Bunu duyduğuma sevindim efendim. Savaşı kazanıyor muyuz efendim?""""Hemen şu anda kes şunu Perks!"" diye kükredi Jackrum.""Yalnızca bir soruydu çavuş."" dedi Polly paylarcasına.""Kimi eski toprakların da arada kendini gösterdiği hikayede, yine çok güçlü karakterleri var Terry'nin artık alıştığımız üzere. Kan emmeye tövbe etmiş Maladict'in kahve krizleri, halüsinasyonları üzerinden işlenen Savaş travmaları, dinci bir eğitim sisteminin elinde harap edilmiş, kişilikleri param parça edilmiş kadınların hikayeleri, yavaş yavaş, göz göre göre delirerek Jeanne d'arc'a dönüşen bir kadın, düşman işgaline karşın hayatına devam etmek zorunda olanların anlatıları, aşkı için veya beklenmedik hata diye tanımladıkları hareketlerin bedelini ödemek için savrulmuş olanlarla dolu, söyleyecek çok sözü olan bir kitap bu.Cinsiyet rollerinin diğer taraftan nasıl göründüğü ise kitabın elini güçlü tuttuğu bir başka kısım. Bir taraftan sadece erkeklerin varlığını, kendilerini ortaya koymalarına izin verilen bir dünyada, duyulabilmek için kadınların nasıl bedel ödemesi gerektiğini tartışıyor aslında Terry, bir taraftan da değişimin travmalarını gösteriyor bize. Bu arada Terry'nin ölümünden sonra tüm o ""Terry'nin cüceleri aslında trans insanlar mı?"" içerikli homo/transfobinin havalarda uçuştuğu tüm o tartışmalarda bu kitaptan asla söz edilmemiş olması da o kadar enteresanmış ki. İnsanların istemediği konuları görmezden gelebilme kapasitesi bir kez daha şaşırttı beni tam burada belirtmek isterim ki.Canavar Alayı aynı zamanda savaş hakkında bir kitap. Bu sefer kenarından köşesinden de değil, savaşa doğrudan ortasından giren bir kitap üstelik. Kimi zaman rahatsız edicilik sınırına yaklaşan, insanın ellerini soğutan anlar da içeriyor ancak bunu savaş anlatımlarındaki alıştığımız yaklaşımlar olan korku veya iğrençlik üzerinden empati dayatarak yapmıyor. Küçük çaplı canavarlıkların nasıl da kaçınılmaz ve doğal olduğunu gösteriyor Terry bize. Ve bu -en azından benim için-, parçalanan cesetlerden bahseden bir savaş anlatısından çok daha fazla ""huzursuzca kıpırdanmaya"" neden oluyor.Asker olmanın nasıl bir his karmaşası olduğunu anlatıyor Terry. İnsanın paylaşmadığı, inanmadığın, hatta kimi zaman umurunda bile olmayan idealler adına nasıl ve neden hayatını feda etmeyi göze alabileceğini tartışıyor.Disk'in en güzel kitaplarından biri olsa da Canavar Alayı, rahatlıkla söyleyebilirim ki en komiği değil. Onlarca muazzam an ve kıkır kıkır gülmeme neden olan tepecik içermesine rağmen karanlık, üzücü ve bazen öfkelendirici bir kitap bu. Bu arada rahatlıkla tek başına, serilerden bağımsız olarak okunabilecek bir kitap elimizdeki.Şimdi (her zamankinden biraz uzun olmakla birlikte bu kez) referanslar ve aldığım notlardan bahsetmek istiyorum biraz:*Hikayenin geçtiği Borogravia ülkesini 40 yıllık D&D'ci olarak Ravenloft'un Barovia'sına gönderme sanmıştım ilk başta. Ancak sonradan öğrendim ki Lewis Carroll'ın gerek İngilizce'ye gerekse Fantazi hikayeciliğine eklediği kelimelerle(bkz: Vorpal, Burble, Slithy vs) pek ünlü şiiri Jabberwocky'daki""Borogoves""dan geliyormuş bu ülkenin adı. Carroll abimizin kokaini çekip çekip yazdığı manyakça şiirinde şöyle geçiyor:Twas brillig, and the slithy tovesDid gyre and gimble in the wabe;All mimsy were the borogoves,And the mome raths outgrabe.Bu arada şiiri de 2016 yılında Fatoş Atay Türkçeye çevirmiş, bakarken sinirim bozuldu, elim ayağım titredi. Ya Fatoş ya...Pişindiydi kayrak tirsukelelerDönenip delgilendiler otgelde;Mızlıydılar tarazlı gubibikler,Donguzlarsa nezgilendi.*Kitapta Düşes'in fotoğrafının öpülmesiyle birlikte bahsedilen uygulanan askere alma ritüellerinden bir diğeri Şilinin Getirilmesi, İngiliz Ordusunun uyguladığı bir gelenek aslında. Kralın (veya Kraliçenin, o an kim tahttaysa artık) Şilini diye bilinen gelenek, Birleşik Krallık askeri güçlerinin 18. 19 ve 20. yüzyıllarda uyguladığı bir kabul ritüeliydi. Kökenleri 1600lere (İngiliz İç Savaşı) uzanan geleneğe göre askere alınan kişiye hak edilmiş ödeme olarak bir şilin para verilir ve ancak bu işlemden sonra kişi asker olarak kabul görürdü. (bkz:King's Shilling)*Tatlı vampirimiz Maladict'in barda""Elbette ben asla... at sidiği içmem"" (I, of course, don't drink... horse piss)demesi yine Dracula'nın o pek ünlü""I never drink... Wine.""repliğine gönderme. Daha önce aynı şakayıCarpe Jugulum'da da yapan Terry belli ki seviyor Dracula. Ve Dracula sevgimi artık utanmadan itiraf edebilen (teşekkürler Ezgi) benim yüzümde de her defasında aynı tebessümü oluşturuyor bu. Şuraya da Dracula'nın sinema uyarlamalarından birnever drink wine potpurisibırakıyorum madem fırsattan istifade.*Trollerin askere alınmasına karşı Strappi'nin itirazlarına Jackrum'un ""Sorma-söyleme politikamız var, biliyorsun"" demesi de Clinton ile birlikte anılan don't ask don't tell (sorma söyleme) politikasına bir gönderme. Don't ask, don't tell, 90'ların başında uzun süredir yürürlükte olan homoseksüellerin Amerikan Ordusunda hizmet vermesini engelleyen kanunların tekrar incelenmesi sonrası ortaya çıkan fiili ve enteresan şekilde kanuni bir durumdu. Demokrat ve muhafazakarlar, politika değişimi üzerinde uzlaşamayınca, ordu yönetiminin askerlere cinsel yönelimlerini sormasına izin verilmeyen, ancak halen askerlerin eşcinsel veya bi-seksüel olduğunu beyan etmesi durumunda ordudan uzaklaştırıldığı bir durum oluştu. Popüler kültürde de sıkça dalga konusu olan yasa, nihayet büyük tartışmalarla da olsa 2011'de kaldırıldı.*Zımparataş'ın içtiği ""Elektrikli Yergümleyen"" aslında basit bir pil.*""Strappi'nin karatahtaya tepesine ""NEDEN SAVAŞIYORUZ BİZ?"" yazmış, sonra da kenara , alt alta ""1, 2, 3"" rakamlarını eklemişti""Bu göndermemiz ise Country Joe'nun ünlü şarkısı Feel Like I'M Fixing to Die Rag'a.69 Woodstock'taki pek meşhur kaydınıda bırakıyorum buraya hatta.*Yüzbaşı Bluz'ün mektubundaki ""terfi sayesinde de günlüğüm 1 şilin arttı"" bilgisinden hareket eden az işli bir arkadaşımız alt.fan.pratchett 'da Sterlin/Borogoravian Paritesi hesaplamış.

Ben çok daha eski olduğunu sanıyordum oysa.*Igorina'nın""Yalnızım tepeyi aştığımdan beri, Çayırda ve vadide yürürken...""diye mırıldandığı şarkı,The Girl I Left Behind Meadlı İngiliz Ordusu tarafından sık kullanılan bir folk şarkısı. Kırmızı urbalı yaylalar bir nevir.*Hikayenin sonlarına doğru karşılaştığımız Lord Rust'ın ne menem bir insan olduğunu ve alayındakilerin neler yaşadığınıJingo'da çok iyi görmüştük bu arada.*DeSoze'e(bkz:Gerçek) ""Karikatüristimiz Fizz özel baskı için bunu çizdi"" derken Terry'nin referans verdiği karikatürcü aslında Phiz lakaplı Hablot Knight Browne. Phiz 1800lerin sonunda özellikle Dickens karikatürleriyle tanınmış bir çizer (bkz:Hablot Knight Browne)*DeSoze'un Borogravia birlikleri tarafından durdurulduğunda söylediği ""Civis Morporkias sum, efendim. Ben bir Ankh-Morpork vatandaşıyım."" Roma'dan alınma bir tabir. Tıpkı 2000 yıl önce dünyanın birçok köşesinde Civis Romanus sum diyen roma vatandaşlarının güvenlik içinde seyahat edebilmesi gibi, Ankh-Morpork da tartışmasız dominantlığıyla kendi vatandaşlarına bu güveni verebiliyor.Aslında bu söz Roma'da basit bir güvenlik önleminden fazlasını ifade etmişti tarih boyunca. Evet elbette özünde bir şiddet sözü yatıyordu. Roma'nın vatandaşlarına dokunmak demek Roma'nın korkunç gazabını üzerine çekmek demekti aynı zamanda. Ki dönemin adalet anlayışına göre suçun pek de bireysel olmadığını, suçlunun selam vermiş olduğu her canlının enlemesine kesilip de kazıklarda sergilenmesi gibi kimi tatlılıkların vaka-ı adiyeden sayıldığını da unutmamak gerekiyor.Ancak kökenleri ne olursa olsun Civis, sadece erkeklerin sahip olabildiği (kadınlar vatandaş olarak görülmediği için) kimi Romalılık haklarının(civis Romanus-Roma Vatandaşı) yanı sıra, sum kişilik ekiyle de o kişiyi de yücelten ve statü sağlayan bir söz olarak kullanılmıştı.Hatta Aziz Paulus yahudiler tarafından şikayet edilip zincire vurduğunda bunu söylemiş ve özgür olmuş, daha sonra hristiyanlığa aktarılan Roma geleneklerinden de biri olmuş, adeta bir medenileşme, Evropalılık bilinci, merkeziyetçilik gibi anlamların odağı haline gelmişti.Elbette özellikle sanayi devrimi sonrası yaşanan süreç sonrası artık Civis sumculuktan pek söz edemesek de, bugün ""I am an American""a dönüşüp dönüşmemiş olduğu da başka bir yazı içinde tartışılmak üzere kalsın burada.*Bluz'ün Resim gönderebilen klakların çalışma mantığını çözdükten sonra bir sıkıştırma algoritması kullanmayı düşünüp düşünmediğini sorması gerçekten muazzam. Önerdiği kodlama tekniği de hali hazırda resim sıkıştırmasında sıkça kullanılan RLE (bkz:Run-length encoding)*Bu arada Maladict'in kahve krizlerini dindirmek için kullandığı metotlardan biri de yine tarihsel bir olaya dayanıyor. Amerikan İç Savaşı sırasında Birleşik Devletler ablukası sayesinde Konfederasyon askerleri için kahve neredeyse temin edilmesi imkansız bir hale geldiğinde denedikleri şeylerden biri de meşe palamuduymuş.*N*ran tarafından, kendisi mental yetenekler açısından dezavantajlı bir insan olduğu için Kaldırım Çiçekleri olarak çevrilen genelevin orijinal adı ""The Solid Doves"" ve 19. yy'da fahişeler için sıklıkla kullanılan soiled doves (kirli güvercin) teriminden geliyor. N*ran, Fahişeyi görür görmez yapıştırmış kaldırımı ama Soiled dove aynı zamanda tarihi bir savunmanın da adı. 1899'da Oklahoma'da bir fahişe olan Minnie Stacey adına avukat Temple Lea Houston tarafından yapılmış olan savunmanın tam metinini sadece kitap formatında bulabildim ama savunmaşöyle başlıyor.*Vimes'ın kendini tanıtırken ""Özel elçi, Büyükelçi gibi bir şey ama altın paketli küçük çikolatalar olmadan."" derken bahsettiği çikolatalar pek ünlü Ferrero Rocher çikolataları.Göndermenin kaynağı olan reklam da şuradan görülebilirki gece vakti fena halde canımın altın paketli top top çikolata çekmesine neden oldu...Sonu itibariyle de gri bir kitap bu aslında. Çok da spoiler vermeye niyetim yok ama tüm bunların sonunda değişimin mümkün olduğunu ama gerçekten bunun için çok fazla şey gerektiğini söylüyor bir bakıma. Terry'nin de dediği gibi bu bir peri diyarı kalesi değil ve burada geçen hikayeler de sonsuza kadar mutlu yaşadılar diye bitmiyor. Hem hayal kırıklığına uğruyor hem de umutlanıyorsunuz enteresan şekilde aynı anda. Yani bu yönüyle de tanıdık geliyor.Son söz olarak; Kademe kademe açılan, her parçasında da yeni yerlere uzanan, harika bir kitaptı Canavar Alayı. Beni en çok etkileyen, en sevdiğim Disk kitaplarından biri oldu ve üzerinde yazabilecek kadar sindirmem biraz vakit aldı. Ama Tereddütsüz tavsiye ediyorum ve değişim için pantolon içine çorap tıkılması gerekmeyen bir dünyada (veya adına) Terry dedemin hayal gücüne bir kez daha şapka çıkarıyorum.""Bir savaşı durdurmak, başlatmaktan çok daha zordur. Başlatmak için ""Hücum!"" diye bağırmamız yeterliyken durdurmak istediğinizde herkesin meşgul oluverdiğini görürsünüz.""",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34511.Monstrous_Regiment,Monstrous Regiment.txt
Arabesque,"DNF at 37%, 2 stars(mild spoilers but no major plot points)I wanted to like this book, I really really did. I found out about it's existence less than a month ago and decided on a reread of the series so I could end with this one. During this reread I remembered why I liked the Wings series so much. The original take on fairies, the magical world, the magic system, the characters, etc. After finishing Destined I wondered where Arabesque could go. The world had been saved, the story had been finished, the series had a beautiful -if not bitter sweet- ending.I started Arabesque with hope. Hope that it was as good as the first four books, hope that I would see beloved characters again and see what happened to them in the past ten years, hope that we would learn about what happened in Avalon after Jamison told Laurel about his plan. I was not disappointed. I got all of this and more. I ended up shedding a little tear when Yeardley spoke to Chelsea.It was everything I had hoped it could be, sadly enough, it only lasted for a few chapters. In my opinion, these first few chapters are the best -and should have been the only- part of this book. It's a beautiful answer to the questions I had after finishing Destined. Everything else in this book just feels off.Arabesque feeling different, dare I say almost wrong, started quite innocently with popculture references. Popculture references in general are not a bad thing, however, it felt weird, seeing as other than mentioning Gaiman's Stardust, there hadn't been any in the previous books. Which is the reason I was startled when the Academy was described as Hogwards-like and Yeardley as it's Dumbledore or Snape (in my humble opinion, Yeardley is ten times the man Snape could ever wish to be, but this is a discussion for another time). There were other popculture references, but I've tried to forget all of them seeing as they felt so out of place.Rowen's storyline was alright, and if it had been tweaked a bit it might even have been on par with the other books. The idea of a fairy going to the human world to learn ballet is an interesting concept with lots of possibilities. An entitled fairy who believes it's her right to be a ballerina and since she's scared of losing her place in the ballet group to someone less deserving (but she ""isn't jealous"" she just ""wants to be special"") decides to go the the human world even though she's very spieciest towards humans and barely has a positive thought about them, is less interesting. I think her learning to love humans could have been an interesting set up for a story, had it involved more than watching Netflix, asking Laurel's dad some questions and the most insta instalove I have seen in quite some time.Compliments need to be given to the ballet school and Meghan storyline. I am neither a ballet dancer, nor black, so I can't say how well it was handled, other than that I liked the light that was put upon this issue. You see, Meghan is the only black student in Rowan's course, not only that, she's a scholarship student. It is made clear quite quickly that the other (white) students are not a fan of Meghan, who is better than all of them. Racism in the ballet industry is a real issue. The fact that Arabesque didn't shy away from showing it was definitely a nice thing to see.Next up: Tamani's storyline. Where do I even start?Let's start with the parts I enjoyed. Tamani and Laurel have planted a seed. I loved reading about this since I had wondered about how this would be done since they were living in the human world. Definitely one o the highlights of the story! Tamani is looking forward to becoming a father and is so damn proud, it's wonderful to read and see. I love Tamani and Laurel and their future child.Now for the bad parts, Tamani's nightly hobby. It's, how do I say this, bad? ridiculous? Like it was writen by someone who had just finished Batman the Animated Series and decided to add Tamani to it? And I could have looked passed this. I was willing to take it for what it was, roll my eyes at Tamani's shenanigans and laugh it off. It wouldn't have bothered me if not for the world breaking elements in it.You see, Tamani's plotline suddenly takes a left turn and introduces worldbuilding elements that have never been a part of the Wings world before. Where were these during the first four books? Laurel and co. could definitely have used some of this. It didn't even need to have an explicit appearance in the main series, just a mention or reference would have been more than enough. But no, it hadn't. Which means it didn't exist up until Arabesque was written. It feels like a macguffin just created to give Tamani information and to then never be seen again. Was there really no other way Tamani could have figured this out?You might be wondering why I haven't mentioned Laurel yet. I too had been wondering why there was barely any Laurel in this book. Even though she's the main character for the first four books, she barely appears in Arabesque. Arabesque has two main POV's: Rowen's and Tamani. Tamani thinks a lot about Laurel and his love for her, how she's doing, their sprout, etc. But Laurel herself barely if at all appears in the book after the first few chapters. I'm glad for other reviews mentioning some information you find out about her around the end of the book. If no, I would have known nothing about her other than ""she lives in the house near the gate, has a lot of plants and potion making stuff in her house and is looking forward the having her child"".David is mentioned briefly but that's it, and Chelsea gets a moment to shine in Avalon and we meet the family she created for herself. Both of them deserve the best.I'm angry at this book, angry cause of the disappointment I felt while reading it, angry cause I had to dnf it even though I wanted to love it, angry because it can't even hold a candle to the beauty that is the original four books. In my opinion: don't read this book, and if you do, just read the first few chapters where they visit Avalon and then close the book and put it away.

Blood Over Bright Haven,"This review is a copy of the transcript of my video review onBlood Over Bright Haven.ARC provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.Unbelievable... She did it again.Blood Over Bright Havenis proof that no one writes standalone fantasy books as good as M.L. Wang. Full stop.“Truth over delusion. Growth over comfort. God over all.Here we are. A new adult fantasy book by M.L. Wang is finally here. Whether you knew about my book reviews from Goodreads, Twitter, or BookTube, you might have known that I have been a diehard fan ofThe Sword of Kaigenby M.L. Wang for years. I read and reviewedThe Sword of Kaigenall the way back in January 2019. So four and a half years ago. Since then, it has been an utter delight seeing readers continuously lovingThe Sword of Kaigen. I have received many kind messages of gratitude for my book recommendation I will always treasure. For the past four and a half years, I told myself to always uphold my patience in waiting for Wang’s newest book. And now that I have readBlood Over Bright Haven, I am glad to say this patience has been rewarded.The Sword of Kaigenwas not a fluke.Blood Over Bright Havenmay be a different kind of fantasy novel compared toThe Sword of Kaigen, but is another standalone masterwork. M.L. Wang's storytelling is a blessing to the genre, and we readers are lucky to live in the same era as her. And we should do the job of bestowing her books to future fantasy readers.“It matters because you’re a child. The future ultimately isn’t mine or Sciona’s. It’s yours.”Blood Over Bright Haventakes place in the industrial utopia of Tiran, and it follows the story of two main characters. The first one is Sciona. An orphan since the age of four, Sciona has devoted every waking moment to the study of magic for more than twenty years. Her goal is to be the first woman ever admitted to the High Magistry. But when she finally claws her way up to the ranks to become a highmage, she finds that her challenges have just begun. Her new colleagues will do everything they can to make sure she knows she is unwelcome, and one of the ways they do this is to provide her with a Kwen janitor instead of a qualified lab assistant. This janitor, however, is the second main character: Thomil. Sciona and Thomil will have to work together to advance Sciona's status and unravel the mysteries of magic.This is the premise of the book. It is a dark academia fantasy novel brimming with mystery, tragedy, morality, and echoes of the past. As you can probably tell, the pursuit of truth is a big motivator of the character’s motivations. And believe me on this,Blood Over Bright Havenis a relatively small fantasy book. But at 120,000 words long, this standalone novel packed many emotional themes to explore, and the characterizations and development were insanely well-written. As you can imagine from Wang's storytelling if you have readThe Sword of Kaigen.“All those jobs involve people, and I’m terrible with people. Magic is the one area where I can shut myself in a room with my books and my thoughts and come out more powerful than I went in. It doesn’t matter how big, or strong, or pretty you are in magic. It doesn’t matter how much people like you. With my fingers on the keys of a spellograph, if I can just think hard enough, I’m the most powerful person in the world.”Blood Over Bright Havencirculates around many themes like legacy, family, vengeance, love, sacrifice, and intense faith and prejudice. As I said, it is a 120,000 words long novel, but if I discuss how each theme was magnificently implemented into the narrative, we will be here longer than it would be. So I will narrow it down to two main themes. And to explain my first point, I need to compare this novel to a recently released and recent favorite dark academia novel:Babelby R.F. Kuang. InBabel, the two main themes tackled in that book were colonialism and racism. Whether they were too on the nose or not, and whether you (as a reader) prefer it to be more subtle, I will leave that for you to decide on your own. But here’s the thing. One of the main themes inBlood Over Bright Havenis gender injustice or misogyny. I know some readers are usually annoyed by this. But look at it this way. If you liked reading the theme of gender conflicts and injustice portrayed inThe Wheel of Timeby Robert Jordan, but prefer it to be much more efficient and less repetitive, thenBlood Over Bright Havenwill be suitable for you. This theme is profoundly utilized in the first half of the novel, and it remains strongly evident in the second half for many good reasons I cannot mention due to spoilers. I personally found it to be so extraordinarily well done. Social status, justice, ambition, faith, and racism are some of the other key themes ofBlood Over Bright Haven. And it was unforgettable how Wang integrated all of these into topics of extreme bigotry, selfishness, and delusion. This novel depicts a quest for knowledge and truth at all costs, no matter how bloody it gets.“You’re the worst kind of murderer, I think… The kind who won’t even acknowledge her crime. You’ve never worshipped a god of truth… You worship a delusion.”It is said if you stand up for nothing, you will fall for anything. However, what if the beliefs you stood up for have been the wrong thing? And then there is the matter of intentions versus the result of actions. What if your intentions were good, but the result is disastrous? Is it better when an intention of an individual is bad, but the result turns out great? Faced with this situation, which one is more benevolent and virtuous? Will guilt or grief be enough to cancel harmful actions brought out of good intentions? These are a few questions raised inBlood Over Bright Haven. It is true thatBlood Over Bright Haven, as I said, is a different kind of book fromThe Sword of Kaigen. I mean, even the subgenre itself is different.The Sword of Kaigenis an Asian-inspired military epic fantasy,Blood Over Bright Havenis a dark academia or gaslamp fantasy novel. But there is no doubt that quite similar themes in this novel brought forth the emotional impact of immense proportions asThe Sword of Kaigendid. And, of course, comparable toThe Sword of Kaigen, this review is incomplete without talking about the characters and excellent characterizations.“The Caldonnae and most peoples beyond the barrier weigh a person by their actions and the effect they have on the world. It’s not enough to have meant to do good in the world; if you don’t do good, most gods—those of rivers, the hunt, and the fields—don’t care for your motivations. Why should they?”It is practically unanimous that those, myself included, who lovedThe Sword of Kaigentreated Wang’s characterizations, arc, and development as masterful. And rest assured. You will get those again here. The 27 years old Sciona Freynan started off moderately, and I’m assuming intentionally, unlikeable. She was an egomaniac, self-centered, and single-mindedly driven toward her ambition. But remember that this leaves room for rewarding character development. Through her encounter and budding relationship with Thomil, a kind-hearted melancholic character with a harsh past, Wang achieved fruitful characterizations and growth. For both of them, not just Sciona. And I cannot help but wish more authors and storytellers were as capable as the way Wang portrayed characters’ emotions and relationships as deeply as possible. I don’t think it’s a spoiler to say that some revelations in this book changed everything for the characters, and when that happened, I almost literally felt the devastating damage it did to the characters. Yes, not just Sciona and Thomil, but also Alba, Carra, and the other supporting characters. The way M.L. Wang writes characters and palpable emotional turmoils through actions, inner thoughts, and dialogues can be reflected only by the best kind of authors. And Wang is definitely one of them. By the end of the book, Sciona Freynan belongs in my list of favorite characters. To do everything M.L. Wang achieved here in a one-off standalone book (a relatively short one) feels almost impossible. And yet, she succeeded. This book will bring many thought-provoking discussions on principles and morality, and I haven’t even talked about the complex magic system.“Thomil said that a woman was weighed at the gates of Heaven by her actions and their impact. Well, Sciona was going to leave an impact. Whatever happened next, whether it led to Hell or Heaven, she was going to have a hand in directing it. Sick or sound, good or evil, she was still Sciona Freynan. And Sciona Freynan didn’t slow down. Sciona Freynan would be remembered.”I have made it crystal clear that I am a lifelong fan of manga and anime, andFullmetal Alchemistby Hiromu Arakawa, or the anime adaptationFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, is one of my top favorite stories of all time out of all storytelling mediums. You can probably imagine my uncontrollable excitement to witness thatBlood Over Bright Havenis, intentionally or not, inspired by it. I’m going to assume some part of it is true because the official synopsis ofBlood Over Bright Havendid mention the novel is suitable for those who loveFullmetal Alchemist. I think this is accurate. And whether inFullmetal Alchemistor not, one of the irrefutable laws of alchemy is the law of equivalent exchange. It is impossible to conjure something out of nothing. The magic of mapping and siphoning through a spellograph inBlood Over Bright Havenis one of the most initially complex magic systems I have ever encountered. If you have difficulty understanding or visualizing the magic here, do not worry, I felt the same, too, at first. But everything will be clearer near the second half of the book.“Men, love your progeny as God loves his Tiranish children. For, as the Tiranish are made in the image of Feryn, your children are your mirror. He of good character will rule his children well and their quality will speak to his. Govern your children for they are your truest reflection. They are your legacy, and a man’s legacy is as close as he may reach to godhood.”But for those who feel confused and want to understand the magic sooner, I will try to explain them to you now as simply as possible. I will leave out all the author's in-text explanations and visualization for you to read yourself. So treat it this way. Spellograph is a map, or a graph, of the Otherrealm, a realm where the mages draw energy from. Mapping is choosing the precise and correct location in the Otherrealm. After that, siphoning is the act of drawing out the energy from the designated coordinates in the Spellograph. That energy is then used for a myriad of usages like powering the industrial utopia of Tiran, unleashed elemental magic, and more. This is as simple of an explanation as it gets. The in-text magic system is more elaborate and intricate. And I cannot help but applaud M.L. Wang for this display of creativity. The magic was brilliantly created, and every plotline and tribulation resulting from it was totally engaging.“Know your rights, know your spells, and press on past the detractors— or through them, if you must. It’s a skill you’ll need over and over again in the High Magistry.”With the satisfying character arc, the immersive setting, and the seamless blend of magic and science, M.L. Wang gets what I love to read in my SFF books. She gave literal meaning to the ""dark"" in dark academia.Blood Over Bright Havenis an apt title for the book. As you can probably expect from her adult fantasy books, this is a violent novel with merciless actions. The character's wrath and sorrow will peak. Self-serving and malicious characters will try to aggravate you. Gory scenes are included, and my god, the action scenes...Blood Over Bright Havendon't contain as many battle scenes asThe Sword of Kaigendid. But do not take this to mean the book was ever lacking in high-stakes conflict and pulse-pounding tensions. Once the revelations kicked into the narrative, the book was ridiculously unputdownable. I finished this book in two days, and it was worth neglecting every book in my TBR pile for it. I love reading fantasy books where every action has irreplaceable repercussions, and as the intensity keeps ramping up, the climax sequences accomplish one of the most memorable crimson scenes of chaos I have ever read. I cannot help but wish there better be a special edition ofBlood Over Bright Havenone day. So many scenes in the book, not just the ending sequences, would benefit from having interior illustrations. I will keep my fingers crossed that day will come.“Because good people can turn desperate when the horrors are upon them— especially people whose culture of plenty has left them with no systems to cope with scarcity or cataclysm. Good people will turn monstrous when it’s down to their survival or someone else’s.”There is not much else to say here. Any more beyond this is just redundant. Order and read this book as soon as possible. The character's story arcs were amazing, the threats felt real, the world-building was well-polished, and there were many beautifully written passages. M.L. Wang accomplished so much in this relatively short one-off standalone novel. It is astounding. Bloody brutal, creative, and intelligently crafted with powerfully heavy-hitting themes on morality and intentions, M.L. Wang's return to the adult fantasy scene signified her skills as an absolutely incredible storyteller.Blood Over Bright Havenis indisputably another standalone masterpiece from M.L. Wang. It is a dark academia fantasy novel at its best. It overtopsBabelby R.F. Kuang for me. The fantasy genre is dominated by series. And it is true a terrific one-off standalone fantasy novel is relatively difficult to find. But the greatest kind of standalone fantasy book exists, and it can deliver the high emotions, intensity, and intricacies of a series efficiently and effectively.Blood Over Bright Havenis that kind of standalone book. So bravo, M.L. Wang. For crafting another masterpiece.“Maybe it would be a hundred generations before the sun rose on a life of dignity for their descendants, but the worthwhile run was not the sprint.”You can pre-order this book from:AmazonThe quotes in this review were taken from an ARC and are subject to change upon publication.You can findthisand the rest of my reviews atNovel Notions| I also have aBooktube channelSpecial thanks to my Patrons onPatreonfor giving me extra support towards my passion for reading and reviewing!My Patrons: Alfred, Aliysa, Anastasia, Andrew, Andrew W, Annabeth, Arliss, Barbara, Biskit, Brad, Cade, Casey, Chris, Diana, Donna, Dylan, Edward, Elias, Ellen, Frank, Gary, Gregory, Hamad, Helen, Hunter, Jenn, Jesse, Jimmy Nutts, Joie, Justin, Kristina, Luis, Lufi, Melinda, Michael, Michael, Mike, Miracle, Nicholas, Norbert, Radiah, Samuel, Sarah, Sarah, Scott, Shawn, Tori, Tracy, Wendy, Wick, Xero, Yuri, Zoe.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208430658-blood-over-bright-haven,Blood Over Bright Haven.txt
Of Blood and Fire,"An excellent effort for the author's debut,A pity it gave me so much déjà vu.Final Rating: 3.9/5🌕🌕🌕🌕🌑This book is one part ""fantasy's greatest hits compilation"", combined with one part ""overwhelming levels of déjà vu."" Indeed, if this were my first foray into high fantasy, I suspect it would have astounded me, leaving me spellbound in its imaginative embrace. However, the familiarity of its elements – reminiscent of classics like 'The Wheel of Time' for its main characters, the dragon-master bond akin to 'Eragon', and the mythical races straight out of Tolkien's lore – makes me feel that there is likely a glitch in the Matrix (code for: déjà vu). Even the coming-of-age hunt at the beginning echoes 'Faithful & the Fallen', and there is a bit of weaponry that even suggests Sanderson's shard blades are present here too.While many of these great devices are the very reasons I'm drawn to fantasy, their assembly in 'Of Blood and Fire' is akin to a well-known recipe – comforting, yet lacking the thrill of the unexpected. My affection for these tropes kept me engaged, but I couldn't shake off the feeling of treading familiar ground, which occasionally bordered on the mundane. In sum, the book is a homage to the genre's giants, a comforting journey for a fantasy aficionado but perhaps missing a spark of originality to truly set it apart.“I told him that the sun will set, and it will rise again, and it will do so the next day and the next. The gods are in charge of such things, but it is by our own will that we pick ourselves up when we fall.”World Building: 4/5In Cahill's world of Epheria, a land rich with Elves, Dragons, Giants, Humans, and Dwarves, each race and city has a deep history, reminiscent of fantasy greats like 'Lord of The Rings' and 'Wheel of Time'. The magic system piques interest, although it's not revolutionary. Cahill's strength lies in his world-building - the detailed settings and cultures make Epheria feel alive and bursting with untold stories. It's this vivid and well-crafted world that truly captivates and showcases Cahill's talent. While he is a very good job of synthesizing into something fresh, the lack of originality means I really struggle to give it a 5/5.Story Telling: 3.5/5Set in the war-divided land of Epheria, the story unfolds in the humble village of Milltown. Here, three young boys on the cusp of manhood face The Proving, an age-old test of maturity. But their lives take an unexpected turn with the arrival of strangers, catapulting them into a centuries-old conflict.Despite these familiar beginnings, Cahill's storytelling stands on its own. His writing weaves traditional fantasy themes with modern nuances, creating a narrative that's both nostalgic and fresh. It's this blend of old and new – the classic tale of unsuspecting heroes drawn into epic battles, now told with contemporary flair – that makes Cahill's work both comforting and surprising. While this is clearly inspired by previous fantasy greats, it doesn't ever feel like plagiarism. Indeed, it is a testament to how classic fantasy can evolve and I am thoroughly looking forward to the next installment to see if he can take it in fresher directions.Characterisation: 4.5/5Cahill's debut novel is at its best when it comes to character development, a hallmark of classic fantasy, in my view. He has a knack for bringing even minor characters to life, imbuing them with depth and individuality. The story's core, the coming-of-age journey of Calen, Ella, Rist, and Dann, is not just captivating but is laced with suspense, especially since Cahill doesn't hesitate to take risks with his characters' fates. This approach adds a thrilling unpredictability to the narrative. With such a diverse and well-drawn ensemble, I find myself eagerly wondering about the destinies of each character. This level of engagement and anticipation speaks volumes about Cahill's skill in crafting compelling characters and weaving their stories into the fabric of his fantasy world.Enjoyment: 3.5/5In reviewing 'Of Blood and Fire', I found myself in a bit of a fantasy rollercoaster. There were moments that hit all the right notes, feeling like a 'fantasy greatest hits' – those parts I absolutely loved. But then, there were sections I just skimmed through, mainly because they felt too familiar, almost like reruns of what I've already read. The comfort of familiar tropes was nice, but at times, especially in the beginning, it veered towards the mundane.However, the story took a turn for the better as it progressed. The latter half started to carve its own identity, moving away from the well-trodden path, which I found really promising. It's this shift that has piqued my interest for the second book in the series. Having joined the bandwagon a bit late, I'm now genuinely excited and can't wait to dive into the next book – it looks downright awesome from what I've seen! This gradual evolution in the narrative gives me hope that the upcoming installment will align more closely with my taste for unique and engaging fantasy storytelling.Final Rating: 3.9/5🌕🌕🌕🌕🌑My favourite books of 2023 in preferential order🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕:1.The Shadow of the Gods-(My Review)2.The Grace of Kings-(My Review)3.The Lies of Locke Lamora4.The Forgetting Moon-(My Review)5.The Justice of Kings-(My Review)6.Kings of the Wyld-(My Review)🌕🌕🌕🌕🌗:7.Morning Star-(My Review)8.The Blade Itself-(My Review)9.Tress of the Emerald Sea-(My Review)10.Red Seas Under Red Skies-(My Review)11.The Escape Artist: The Man Who Broke Out of Auschwitz to Warn the World12.Empire of the Vampire-(My Review)13.Assassin's Apprentice-(My Review)14.Malice-(My Review)15.Golden Son🌕🌕🌕🌕🌑:16.Leviathan Wakes-(My Review)17.The Winter King-(My Review)18.Of Blood and Fire-(My Review)19.Gardens of the Moon-(My Review)🌕🌕🌕🌗🌑:20.Deadhouse Gates-(My Review)🌕🌕🌕🌑🌑:21.The Song of Achilles-(My Review)22.Red Sister-(My Review)🌕🌕🌑🌑🌑:23.Babel: An Arcane History-(My Review)",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56750401-of-blood-and-fire,Of Blood and Fire.txt
The Ninth Rain,"ILOVEtales like these. There were legendary wars many years ago where good prevailed, but no-one really remembers what really happened and now there are endless mysteries and the possibility of having to face an ancient enemy yet again.Before you carry on reading, I feel the need to say that I have detailed most of the history leading up to the present day of the story below. I did this for two reasons:1 - Because it is such a fascinating history and I think this serves as an excellent hook for a story by an author that is not yet widely read, but should be.2- Because it took me a while to get into this story, but I knew the author would deliver in the end and I do not want you to start and give up if you are not familiar with the author.So, if you prefer gathering these bits and pieces of the background that are doled out sparingly through the book as it was written, and are happy to give this book a try, skip the spoiler below.If you are unsure though, give it a read. I do not believe it spoils any of the story. If you are like me you will likely forget most of what is in this review anyway before reading the book so this serves only as enticement for the TBR pile. It already convinced my GF to read this! BTW - the author's first series is great too and you should check that out!The Copper PromiseThe Iron GhostThe Silver TideThe not-that-spoilery-history-backstory-spoiler.Well that was a mouth full! -Once, before their fall, Eborans were respected and feared by all mankind. They were the most beautiful beings on Sarn. Superior to humans in almost every way, many believed them immortal.When the Jure’lia, a hive minded alien species, first attacked, mankind threw all their might against them for the horrors these beings brought with them were almost unimaginable. But humans had no answer to the utter destruction these invaders visited upon Sarn. These Worm People, as they would come to be known, would have consumed everything in their path unopposed were it not for the ferocious fighting of the Eborans and the assistance of their tree god Ygseril. In the hour of Sarn’s greatest need Ygseril brought forth the First Rain and delivered the mythical creatures, magnificent warbeasts of every size and shape, which would defeat the Worm People time and again.The war with the Jure’lia spanned many years. Whenever they were defeated, they would disappear back to where they came from and would not be seen for many years before once again descending from the skies and attacking , bringing forth a new assault in their attempt to consume all. Ygseril would birth a new Rain with every invasion to help repel the invaders, until eventually, during the Eight Rain, the Jure’lia Queen gathered her forces and made a massive assault on the home of the Eborans and their tree god.The Jure’lia were defeated, but through the ages all knowledge of what exactly happened was lost. What is known is that the Jure’lia all died at once, their giant ships plummeted from the sky and crashed all over Sarn.‘The Eighth Rain, when the last war-beasts were born!’ Louis stared up at the vast breadth of the trunk looming above them, a smile on his round, honest face. ‘The last great battle. My dad said that the Eboran warriors wore armour so bright no one could look at it, that they rode on the backs of snowy white griffins, and their swords blazed with fire. The great pestilence of the Jure’lia queen and the worm people was driven back and her Behemoths were scattered to pieces.’While a huge victory for humans and Eborans, the fallout from the battle was disastrous. Wherever the ships of the Jure’lia violently met their end, some device or other machination of the defeated force caused a sort of infection or disease that corrupted the very place these vessels found their final resting place in. This ever-spreading corruption not only tainted vegetation, but also animals, resulting in monstrous abominations.…what it had been, or what its ancestors had been before it had been worm-touched, she did not know. Something like a bear, perhaps; it was bulky, with a thick midsection and four short but powerful legs, and a long, blocky head. But instead of fur it was covered in pale, fleshy pouches of skin, which shivered and trembled as it moved, and Noon could see four circular black eyes along its head, clustered together and oddly spider-like. Its mouth, when it opened its jaws to roar again, was pink and wet and lined with hundreds of yellow needle-like teeth.Attempts were made to get rid of the remains of these ships, but proved mostly impossible as the death tolls from these attempts were too high. Soon after the vessels crashed, dangerous beings called parasite spirits started inhabiting the areas close to and around these wrecks and would kill anyone they came in contact with. Impervious to weapons apart from Winnow-forged steel, they would roam seemingly aimlessly and kill anyone they came in contact with, with many a victim turned inside out.She didn’t take her eyes from the parasite spirit. ‘If we can drive it back outside of the village, perhaps we can get a proper look at it.’ But it was too late. As they arrived, the spirit was bending down over the hapless Fera, who was still thrusting his pitchfork at it. Long tapered fingers closed over him – Vintage was struck briefly by how it looked like a child peering at a new bug on the ground – and then Fera was falling apart. He screamed as his body was unzipped, and Vintage saw a gout of blood and other fluids hit the dirt. The long transparent fingers were still moving though, and her stomach twisted as the man’s skin rolled back like a carpet being peeled away from a floor.The direst consequence however, of the defeat of the Jurelian Queen and her people, was the death of Ygseril in the final battle. The tree god had delivered his final Rain and so begun the end of the Eborans. For while the humans believed Eborans to be immortal, their everlasting youth and health was derived from drinking the sap of Ygseril which they were now denied of. Eborans started slowly wasting away, until discovering that human blood was a suitable, if not nearly as potent replacement for the sap they so needed. What followed became known as the Carrion Wars, which at the height of it saw Eborans slaughter humans and drinking blood from their still warm corpses in the middle of the battlefields. Before things could get even worse though, what the Eborans believed to be their saving grace, became their eternal curse. A terrible, incurable disease, born of the drinking of human blood, befell these Eborans. They started dying slow and agonizing deaths and before long the Eboran population was decimated, with only a few Eborans escaping this fate. Reviled by humans, and as the last of their kind, they slowly disappeared until most people had only ever heard of them in stories, first as saviors and then as villains.The plot of the book follows three different characters whose stories are destined to be intertwined.A rich, inquisitive adventurer, called Vintage.A Fell-Witch, called Noon.And one of the last living Eborans, called Tormalin.Vintage and her hired muscle, Tormalin set out to explore and gather information about the wreckage of the downed ships left behind by the Jure’lia and along the way are joined by Noon, a fell-witch recently escaped from the Winnowery (They are a cult-like group who believe that fell-witches are evil and should be imprisoned for life in order to protect society from their powers. Yep, Noon has the gift of Winnowfire). An unlikely alliance is formed, and as they travel to these sites and start exploring the secrets of the Jure’lia, they find mysteries wrapped within deeper mysteries. Before long, they realize that things might not be as they seem and that the threat of the Jure’lia might not be as confined to the history books as they would like it to be.As stated earlier, I really liked this book, but that page turning fever that overcomes me when a story is unputdownable did not manifest itself until I had read quite a solid chunk. (Where the three main characters start their journey together.) Once there though, I was completely immersed and had a fantastic time. As with the Copper Cat trilogy, the author’s characters are wonderfully compelling creations who were fun to journey with. The story, once it hooked me, was enthralling, and I feel it is really going to shine in the next two books as the amount of worldbuilding Jen Williams had to do in this one was significant. It was well worth it though as this is a rich and vast world that we have been gifted and I can hardly wait to get my hands on the next installment.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29758013-the-ninth-rain,The Ninth Rain.txt
Iron Flame,"0/5 ⭐️ you thought Fourth Wing was bad…? Oh you sweet summer child.Goodreads has been real finicky about reviews recently so I will only be speaking on the book and its content (not the author though I have very many opinions (none of them kind☺️))also there are spoilers in this review but who cares because you shouldn’t be reading this book to begin with! (Don’t let my sacrifice be in vain)I intended to get this review out way sooner but unfortunately (and unsurprisingly) this book was actually so much worse than Fourth Wing!🥳I naively assumed Fourth Wing would be the top contender for worst book of the year but Iron Flame made me wish I was reading Fourth Wing!!At least Fourth Wing had the decency to be short enough to get through in a week, Iron Flame takes every flaw of Fourth Wing and not only makes it worse but makes it LONGER(???!?!) while somehow simultaneously being even more boring! Wow!🤩 Good job Yarros!!! What a fantasy icon!!🧝🏻‍♀️Remember how Fourth Wing had one of the most idiotic, and juvenile writing styles in any adult fantasy book ever? Imagine that but now in a world where editing was never invented!! 🥰The sentence structure was legitimately horrendous. I actually wish I was kidding.If you have the unfortunate displeasure of being in a twenty mile radius of a copy of Iron Flame and are unlucky enough to stroll past it in the store or your local library, I beg you, after you recover from the sheer horror of being in the same room as such an abomination to fantasy, open it to a random page and just ATTEMPT to read a paragraph out loud.I am a creative writing major, I read books out loud all the time. I have never struggled so much with a book in my entire life. Sincerely whoever had to do the audio book must have the endurance and the mental fortitude of a saint.Forgive me, Yarros, for believing reading should be an enjoyable experience, clearly you do not agree. 🧎‍♀️Also Yarros used 493 ellipses and 1089 em-dashes on my count! The book is about 634 pages!💫And oh! A Drinking game🥂: take a shot every time a character’s eyebrow or brow or brows are mentioned!! Actually don’t! You’d definitely die! Brows are mentioned over a hundred times!!🫠 I have to laugh (or else I might scream) at the idea that THIS is accessible fantasy because not only is the plot and the world building convoluted and unengaging but the writing is so incredibly shit that it makes you reread half of the sentences over again if you want to the vaguest inkling of an idea of what is going on in this horseshit world. To call Iron Flame accessible spits in the face of twenty plus years of hard work and effort by truly talented authors to make fantasy books that are actually welcoming and accessible to a wide audience.Let’s actually talk about the plot. Fourth Wing was derivative and predictable and Iron Flame doesn’t even try to be any more.Here’s a list of some 🌈✨creative😍 plot points Yarros used:- A shitty copycat version of the Hunger Game’s rebellion (with zero of the interesting nuance or intelligent discourse)😯- what is essentially a boring Umbridge at a half-assed attempt to create tension😧- The Rider Quadrant and the Infantry Quadrant finally interact!! They are dropped in the middle of a forest, are being hunted by dragons, and are given two maps and told to go to a location marked on the maps! A simple assignment for students at a war school who surely know how to navigate using a map because that’s an important skill for soldiers to know, right?! 🗺️ Not only do these riders not learn how to read a map until year two (WHY?) but apparently the Infantry and Riders hate each other so much😠 that THEY DON’T EVEN COMPARE THE TWO MAPS WHEN PEOPLE HAVE CONFLICTING IDEAS ABOUT WHERE THEY ARE. THEY WALK AROUND IN A FOREST FOR HOURS INSTEAD OF COLLABORATING ONCE. I don’t care how much you hate someone at school, if you are given a group assignment literally step one is compare all documents you have been given so you can be done as quickly as possible. ALSO WHEN ONE OF THE INFANTRY ASKS TO WHAT TO SO IN THE EVEN OF A DRAGON ATTACK THE RIDERS LAUGH AND MAKE FUN OF THEM FOR BEING SCARED??? THEN WHEN A DRAGON ATTACKS THE RIDERS ARE MAD AT THE INFANTRY FOR DOING THE WRONG THING AFTER THEY LITERALLY WERE NOT TOLD WHAT TO DO!! Yarros when I find you Yarros Yarros when I find you Yarros🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️- Jack Barlow back because I guess Yarros couldn’t come up with another new antagonist… also he’s Venin for reasons. Really it’s not that interesting. The resurrection trope is so fun!!🤩🤗- A torture scene summary that is not scary in the slightest because this book conditions you to know that Violet is never in any real danger despite trying to tell you she is always on the verge of death 😱- A visit to what is essentially the Summer Court in search the Book of some bullshit thing called a luminary (btw we don’t even know what it looks like until 60% through the book AFTER they’ve acquired it???)🤫- a catty ex-girlfriend (named Cat, wow ✨creative✨) making a reappearance and doing nothing but promotes wonderful stereotypes (even though Yarros tries really hard to tell you it doesn’t on page the literal page)💃🏻- and the most anticlimactic and boring battle with the dumbest ending I’ve ever read!! 🤺There are more stupid plot points, but I’m getting brain damage trying to remember the plot of this book so I’m just going to talk about things that made me wish I was attempting to consume whole boulders rather than read the most accessible fantasy book of all time: Iron Flame by Rebecca Yarros😇Varrish. He’s our Umbridge lookalike. He strolls into the Dragon Rider Academy and he’s super scary with his one-eyed dragon Solas!!! 😰I mean he would have been, but literally the first time he does anything scary by letting his dragon incinerate an entire squad, TAIRN FLYS IN AND THREATENS SOLAS. AND SOLAS AND VARRISH BOTH COWER BECAUSE TAIRN IS SO BIG AND SUPER SCARY AND THE 🌈✨⭐️MoST PoWErFuL⭐️✨🌈 DraGOn😀Well maybe this is understandable because Solas just killed like twenty people, right?🤔 But no! Tairn isn’t mad about that, he’s mad because Violet got like a first degree burn.I don’t know what Yarros was attempting to achieve with this scene but you know what it does achieve? It tells the reader that Varrish isn’t actually a scary villain because having Tairn put him in his place the moment he does a single villainous action. IT DESTROYS ALL TENSION YOU COULD HAVE HAD.🧍🏻‍♀️And don’t you worry, dearest reader, this is a trend. LATER TAIRN MAKES VARRISH GET ON HIS KNEES AND APOLOGIZE TO VIOLET FOR BEING MEAN TO HER. ⁉️⁉️IN FACT ANYTIME ANYONE IS MEAN TO VIOLET THE ENTIRE WORLD COMES TO HER DEFENSE. Any character, any dragon, I swear to god a speck of dust could land on Violet wrong and the entire cast of characters would jump them. And it’s not just her friends. THE SIDE CHARACTERS, MAIN CHARACTERS, CHARACTERS WITH LITERALLY A SINGLE LINE OF DIALOGUE, MINOR AND MAIN ANTAGONISTS.THEY ALL COMPLIMENT VIOLETC O N S T A N T L Y.VARRISH COMPLIMENTS HER, THE VENIN COMPLIMENT HER, CAT COMPLIMENTS HER.Sloane (the sister of Liam, the stupid dead guy👱🏻‍♂️ that Violet tries to convince us was her friend) says the most benign of comments against Violet and Rhiannon and every other personality-devoid lampshade of a character in a seven mile vicinity practically threatens to jump this GRIEVING 20 year old girl.Characters that Violet doesn’t even know will compliment her out of the blue.THE BOOK READS LIKE AN INSECURE PERSON WISH FUFILLMENT. 💇‍♀️It’s so unbelievably unbearable. 👹The Violet Defense Squad™️ is literally in every chapter. My favorite part about this book was that I couldn’t find a chapter where Violet isn’t complimented for doing literally nothing in any of all 66 chapters of the entire book.🤭🤩And in case you were concerned that anyone who was mean to Violet would get interesting character development, nope! They either end up dead or want to be her friend by the end🥰 awesome!😎 Violet is my favorite character😍Are you interested in Violet’s character arc? Well let me tell you the wonderful highs of this perfect character that we’re supposed to root for and support!!😘Violet starts out strong by making insane demands of Xaden like demanding he tell her literally everything even though she had her mind read last book! And she doesn’t just mention this once. She mentions this every single time we see Xaden. She doesn’t trust him, she tells us, but she loves him, she tells us. 🙄 They’re such a cute and believable and interesting couple 🥰🥰 and their dynamic is made so much better by that random ex-girlfriend that was included because Yarros got bored I guess!😍On top of being annoying and insecure, Violet decided that this book she would also double down on being one the worst people imaginable! Remember when all those people Violet considered friends died in her first year and she was so sad about that?Well actually this book Violet tells us that she’s gained some new perspective!!🤯Actually she’s glad all those people died because watching all those people die made her a better rider because they inspired her to… not die(?)! Because that’s a normal and morally good thing for our main character that is SO empathetic and SO kind to say!🙈 Violet is so good, I wish I was just like her!!!☺️Also remember Sloane and her dead brother?!👱🏻‍♂️ Well Liam spent all of book one writing letters to Sloane, his only living family! Wouldn’t it be so nice if Violet gave those to Sloane out of the kindness and goodness of her heart to help Sloane cope with the loss of her older brother?!😊 Well she didn’t!!Violet withheld the letters for weeks after Sloane arrived at the school, (weeks in which Sloane very well could have died by the way) and only offered to give Sloane the letters if she agreed to train with Imogen (a girl Sloane does not like) and only agreed to give her one letter a week!! There are over fifty letters Violet! What happens if Sloane dies during a freak accident which you KNOW are rampant at this death school???! Violet is such an empath guys🥺 she really understands and cares for the people around her.😣 Don’t you wish you were just like her?!😁Violet also does a variety of things such as:- Dropping a gryphon flier off the side of a cliff and then being surprised when said gryphon flier’s friends don’t like her? Inspirational💫- Talking shit on the infantry for not trusting dragons and being cowards after literally being a prime example as to why the infantry should not trust riders or their dragons! So empathetic🥺- Wanting to murder Xaden’s ex for saying a couple of barely mean comments to her! A totally rational response!!!👍- Trying to translate a journal from a dead language she doesn’t know (she does know many other dead languages, of course) instead of giving it to the girl that she’s knows understands that dead language! Wow! the smartest main character of our generation! 🤯- Accusing every scholar and student of the school of perpetuating misinformation and hiding history that she herself just found out about! She’s so kind and thoughtful 🥳- Forgetting instantly about her friend who got her neck snapped after some assassin asked who Violet Sorrengail was. She cares so much about her friends!👯‍♀️- And many, many more abhorrent things🤩In case you forgot (because apparently Yarros did 90% of the book) Violet has EDS. Sometimes it’s brought up, but not really with any substance. And Violet just wraps her joints and “pushes through it” and “puts all her pain into a box” (??) and pretends she doesn’t have a problem at all. No further accommodations are granted to her in this book aside from the saddle from last book which is already dumb because everyone trying to hold onto a flying creature should be using saddles anyway.I highly suggest: Fly Or Die: The Ableist Narrative of Toxic Perseverance by Ella T Holmes for a much better explanation than I can provide as someone that doesn’t have EDS.Let’s talk about Xaden because if I have to think about how super special and powerful and amazing Violet is I might eat all the gravel in my backyard. Xaden’s depiction in this book is gross to say the least.Rebecca has confirmed that he’s a PoC which is great!Keeping that in mind, I love how he’s described as incapable of love and is called a monster and is untrustworthy!!😍😍And I absolutely adore that our super special and talented basic white girl Violet is the person that shows him true love and trust and is the only person who can take his mask of cruelty and violence off for the first time even though she’s so much smaller and weaker than big, strong, powerful Xaden. It’s so cool that all the other characters are so terrified of him and that he acts as little more than Violet’s big overprotective and jealous guard dog! I especially love that Violet’s mom practically tortured him and gave him a hundred and something scars and that he has to take responsibility for all of the marked ones!! That’s not concerning and horrific!!!! And I love that he also got another scar for “claiming” Violet!! that’s so attractive and romantic and good representation and not at all fetishizing men of color at all!!!🥰🥰🥰 Thank you so much for your hard work Yarros!!!🫡He’s also annoying and refuses to tell Violet anything unless she asks hyper specific questions. Their whole dynamic is just annoying and stupid.And I love all of Yarros’ other characters who have less personality than paper bags with faces drawn on them!!🪑 Frankly a folding chair has more charm than any of the characters in this book.They’re so unique and are definitely really funny and don’t ever bog down the scenes with so many characters that you can’t tell who is even talking anymore! They’re all unique and dynamic with character arcs!! Of course! What else would they be?😆And the dragons! 🐉 Oh the dragons! How could I forget about the dragons that are nothing but glorified Uber rides!! They don’t do shit but posture and growl and be boring!Here’s some fun facts about dragons: dragons can choose their tail shape but they can’t choose their color which directly influences their personality and temperament!!All baby dragons are gold because that’s interesting! Is there an evolutionary reason for that or something? Not that we’re told of!More dragon sex is mentioned, thankfully we don’t have to live through the dragon-lust again though!Also the dismounts that Rebecca describes the Riders doing are literally physically impossible!! All the riders should be dead if they try to pull that shit! Giant flying dragons are not horses you can’t just walk around on it while it’s diving and jump off of it😭😭Oh and Anadarna also is now like a super special purple/chameleon never before seen breed of dragon with the rarest tail shape!🐲 Are we surprised? No. Just bored. 😴She also now has like a disabled/malformed wing. Her wings were fine in the first book, but now they’re not? Idk. I feel like that should have been a thing in book one but whatever. (Tairn literally blames it on Violet which is sort of hilariously fucked up??) But anyway she obviously can still fly because god forbid a disability ever hinder a character in anyway that makes them adapt, but she can’t ever hold a rider? Violet is like 90 pounds as we are so graciously reminded so I feel like if Andarna gets bigger she definitely should be able to carry her but whatever. 🤷‍♀️TLDR: the dragons are BORING. And they’re not even funny or cool or even scary. Why write about dragons if you make them boring and insignificant to the plot??! And Andarna is a special-special because of course she is. 🤪This review is getting way too long so let’s just talk about the ending.Oh no! Violet’s mom that got no real development or anything died! Anyway. 🧐Why the fuck did the revolution refuse to help Navarre? They claim to be morally superior and to care about the lives of civilians but just blatantly ignore like 50% of the continent’s population because they’re Navarre citizens? And we’re supposed to root for them? Right! Awesome! Okay!😆👍What are the actual morals of the revolution? What is their end goal? Why did Violet join them so quickly without asking any questions??🫠She’s so intelligent!🤓I’m completely fine with Xaden becoming Venin, though I doubt it will be resolved in an interesting way. Though I don’t think it’s really an interesting plot twist and I saw it coming a mile away after all the boring Venin info dumping I had to sit through, but at least it’s something.HOWEVER I CANNOT FORGIVE IT FOR MAKING THE FINAL LINES OF THE BOOK“Welcome to our fucked-up family. Guess we’re brothers now.”THE SECOND TO LAST LINE IN THE BOOK IS “WELCOME TO OUR FUCKED UP FAMILY”😭😭😭😭😭WHAT WHAT WHATDO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT DID TO ME??I READ 634 PAGES OF THE WORST, MEANDERING, BULLSHIT PLOT POINTS, HORRIFIC AND BORING SEX SCENES, INDECIPHERABLE INFO DUMPS, NONSENSICAL MAGIC SYSTEMS, FLAT CHARACTERS, BORING DRAGONS, HORRIBLE REPRESENTATION, AGGRESSIVELY UNFUNNY FRAT BOY HUMOR, UNEDITED GARBAGE AND YOU END IT WITH “WELCOME TO OUR FUCKED UP FAMILY”???????????????!!!!!!!!!!!?!?!?!!?!??!ARE YOU TRYING TO GIVE ME A JOKER ARC??? WAS THAT THE POINT OF THIS BOOK????AM I SUPPOSED TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY AS AN ACTUAL FANTASY BOOK???THE REASON THIS BOOK TOOK ME SO LONG TO REVIEW IS BECAUSE I GOT ACTUAL PSYCHIC DAMAGE FROM THE LAST LINES OF THIS BOOK.I HYPERVENTILATED I THREW MY PHONE I SCREAMED I STARED AT A WALL AND CONTEMPLATED MY PLACE AND PURPOSE ON THIS EARTHI HAD MORE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT THAN ANY CHARACTER IN THIS ENTIRE BOOK IN THE 0.5 SECONDS AFTER READING THOSE LINESHOW AM I SUPPOSED TO REACT TO THAT??DID YARROS THINK SHE ACCOMPLISHED SOMETHING WITH THAT ENDING??HAVE I LOST MY MIND?? PEOPLE LIKE THIS BOOK? PEOPLE TAKE IT SERIOUSLY AND MAKE UP THEORIES FOR IT??? WHAT??????GENUINELY IF YOU LIKE THIS BOOK WHY? WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? ARE YOU OKAY? DO YOU NEED HELP?WELCOME TO OUR FUCKED UP FAMILY??? GUESS WE’RE BROTHERS NOW???YARROS I AM LIVING IN YOUR WALLS WHAT DO YOU MEAN WELCOME TO OUR FUCKED UP FAMILY WHAT DO YOU MEAN😭😭😭😭😭😭I FEEL LIKE I AM ENTITLED TO FINANCIAL COMPENSATION FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL DAMAGE THIS BOOK HAS INFLICTED UPON MEso thanks for reading my review <3 I hope this helps your decision making process when it comes to buying books :) (don’t buy this book) Yarros did not receive any financial compensation for my suffering and I highly recommend that if you want to read this book (for some reason??? Why?? I spent so long writing this to give you reasons not to!😭) you get it from your library or literally any other means.Red Tower and Yarros are not people that deserve your hard earned money or support.Also whoever the fuck claimed to have edited this book is a world class scammer because they got paid for doing literally nothing. But also they should be fired and exiled and never allowed to look at words again.I have more to say but I hit the word limit💀",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/90202302-iron-flame,Iron Flame.txt

(i’ve heard that take and i can’t bring myself to accept it, there’s a limit for how much u can leave open ended and there was A LOT in this book.)spoiler alert !!let me elaborate on this take - i saw this tiktok talking about how there were so many questions bc it’s metaphorically supposed to represent the story curse and how no one truly knows what happened, in the case of the valley arch and what happened to the valors themselves. however, i feel like it would’ve been suitable had it not been the last book in this series. this is very conflicting to rate bc on one hand i feel like the romance delivered but on the other hand it feels like the plot wasn’t completely thought out. and i did expect so much more from the romance still. jacks loved evangeline so much that he rewrote history but we still can’t get a love confession out of him? 😭😭end of spoilersi’m not gonna be the first to admit i love stephanie garber’s writing. i’ve been very vocal about it ever since i first read her other series ‘caraval’ earlier this year. i don’t have a problem with her writing, i think that it can be very magical and i’m glad it hasn’t changed much. one thing that has changed is the plots of her books. when i read the caraval series, the romance stayed a subplot but with this series, everyone fixates on the romance and i think stephanie garber did the same. at the end she doesn’t clear anything up and i think it might be a way to appeal to the audience bc let’s admit - a lot of ppl read fantasy for the sprinkle of romance.i had a few problems with caraval, but overall i loved it and it was very magical. i will stand by this - i love caraval for the magical world building, where the world goes more into depth and is much more magical, and i love ouabh for the romance. don’t get me wrong, the romance in caraval was almost impeccable. however the characters and their background in this series varied very differently. there was so much depth to these characters and jacks was so much more mysterious. his backstory and everything had me bawling. this is why i truly wanted a better ending for evajacks. i feel very conflicted about this book bc i love the characters so much.unfortunately there are going to be spoilers for the rest of this review. i cannot express a lot of my thoughts without mentioning spoilersthe 2 main villains in this book were aurora and apollo. and like i mentioned before, there was no clarification for the other “villains” in the previous books. i am so confused why we never find out what happens to all the other villains in the other books. marisol and tiberius had absolutely no role. she leaves it open ended in the other book about tiberius and we never find out what happens to him but apparently in this book we don’t find out either!! even luc was mentioned once but he never once appeared. it felt as if stephanie garber thought it would be good if she introduced a new villain rather than addressing the previous ones but no!! i expected tiberius to make his comeback but he was only mentioned a few times in the beginning. the fact that he was pretty much all talk no action is prominent in this book lmaoo. and marisol wasn’t even mentioned. does she just rot in jail..? either way i have hope for stephanie garber. she is still one of my favorite authors and even though i didnt like this book as much, her writing shows promise and i hope that it only improves from now.my thoughts:i’m ngl i have mixed feelings about chaos, or castor. i felt so sad after that ending with evangeline last book (like everyone else ofc) but i wonder how chaos would’ve reacted if he found out he killed eva. he seemed apologetic in the last book but he ran away (probably bc of fear). but this book he’s helping eva bc he believed jacks is going to make a huge mistake. i think chaos is overall a good person (even if he went on a whole mf blood rampage 😭😭) but i don’t blame him after he was forced to wear a helm.And he loved her.He loved her.He loved her.He loved her.He loved her so much he’d rewritten history. He’d given up what he had believed was his only chance at love. And now he had finally broken the spell that he never thought he’d escape.jacks has my whole heart. don’t u dare try and start with him not deserving a happy ending he has been through so much and he deserves the world. he’s been through so much pain, and when he talked about how he felt whenever he thought about how evangeline died i lowkey teared up 😭💘 and when he told her oh my god i was dying. that entire scene is engraved into my brain now. HE ALSO KEPT HER NOTE ABOUT HIM CLOSE TO HIS HEART everything he does is just perfect and amazing<33 every single little detail is forever engraved in my heart.evangeline has been everything throughout this entire series. her dumb decisions kept the book entertaining i’m not even gonna lie. but also her love confession to jacks had me sobbing my eyes out it was so sweet. she has been through so much and i’m so so happy she ended up with jacks. she has been through so much and i love how she learned not to be as naive for the most part. she also learned to be more sassy and stand up for herself her character development has been everything. and her slapping apollo after she got her memories back was QUEEN SHIT 👏👏 eva is my girl 4eva and i absolutely love her. even if she was delulu at times but who isn’t? honestly i love how she still had so much hope but didn’t feel like it was enough like omg girl 😭😭 i felt so bad for her.i feel like this book went completely off script. it introduced new villains (besides apollo), didn’t even clarify anything in the previous books, and the ratio of romance changed drastically. i wanted more angst, more JACKS (!!), and a much more deserved ending. i feel as though she just forgot about the other books and decided to change it up. there was so much angst in the previous books and i thought that it would build up in this book into a huge love confession of jacks part but nope. this does not mean i like jacks any less. these characters mean so much to me and i’m happy that they ended up together.there are spoilers for the caraval series mentioned in this paragraph!!the least disappointing aspect was the romance. but that’s not to say there was no disappointment bc my expectations were through the roof after tbona. there were sprinkles of it which i didn’t mind bc it’s a fantasy book, it’s not always going to focus on the romance aspects. but i still don’t understand how their relationship is gonna work with jacks being immortal and evangeline being a human. i mean dante gave up his immortality for donatella 🥹 i rlly expected a grand gesture from jacks, or anything. the best we got was an “i love you” and even though im happy he said it, it was the bare. fucking. minimum. and it hurts me to say that, trust me. the romance was through the roof with this series, but it drastically changed in this book. their love expanded to every universe and we couldn’t even get a love confession out of jacks? i will never get over that.the plot twist about the truth of jacks curse? i’m ngl my heart broke a little after hearing donatella never loved him which was why she survived his kiss. this is not me in any saying i ship them. but when you think about their history and how it applies then knowing the info now, it makes me feel for jacks. he dyed his hair dark blue, it was clear he was heartbroken. and to learn she never had any feelings for him made me feel a bit of nostalgia. also i have another question - does jacks ever find out the truth of his kisses and how they’re only deadly if someone who will never love him kisses him..?the ending with apollo becoming part of the tree actually made me laugh. another thing that has me laughing was how stephanie garber talked in an interview about how the tree on the cover is important in the book AND ITS LITERALLY THE TREE APOLLO GOT TRAPPED IN 😭😭 she rlly knows us!! i’m so glad he got what was coming to him. that scene frustrated me so much and I’M SO GLAD JACKS GAVE HIM WHAT HE DESERVED!! i waited 2 books for jacks to finally punch apollo and it happened, and i’m so satisfied with that !! and him cursing at apollo had my entertainment reaching its peak. i will say she had me in the first few chapters feeling sympathy for apollo but that quickly went away after everything happened. i’m still upset he killed the guards that only followed his command ☹️—the rest of this review is going to be talking about things that were mentioned/i still had questions about after the ending.would you guys believe me if i said this book was going to previously by 4.5 stars? maybe u won’t, but it’s true. during the beginning, it was rlly slow bc apollo made so many appearances and i was bored out of my mind. but every time jacks showed up it made everything better. at one point, i was contemplating on giving it 4.75 stars. can u imagine my disappointment at giving it the rating i’m giving it now?probably notbut the ending was disappointing. maybe it was just me idk but it isn’t even about the apples as much.speaking of the apples, i didnt mind that as much simply bc she explicitly stated that we would know, and even addressed it which was what i wanted the entire time. if she addressed any of the plot holes, i would’ve been happy. the point of a finale is to wrap everything up and maybe if she wrote another book in this series i’d be happy but this is the end of THIS series so i don’t get why so many things were alluded. the fan theories for the apples have me squealing, i’m kinda glad she didn’t explicitly state it simply bc letting us gather our own conclusion lets us be delulu.another thing - the broken heart scar? i don’t understand why it was never used. was it just a way for eva to sense whenever jacks was nearby since it glowed? i expected more from that. i read the bonus epilogues, and it’s clear that stephanie hasn’t forgotten about it. she mentions it but doesn’t even tell us what’s gonna happen. i really expected something when it was first mentioned in the beginning while i was reading this book. i thought the mention of the scar was going to be foreshadowing but i was disappointed to find out it wasn’t. it’s basically used as a tell tale sign that jacks is nearby.something i’m curious about is how evangeline didn’t die when she kissed jacks. i think the obstacle of apollo helped show how he would meet his end eventually but also i think it helped show that there were other forms of consequences? idk i can’t wrap my head around the fact that it was so easy for them to finally kiss after not kissing for over 2 books. there’s no confirmation, just guesses evangeline has made which makes it all the more confusing. she talks about how his love might help break the curse but i wish stephanie garber confirmed at least something. i finished reading and i honest to god had to think about this book for a long time. it was so bittersweet finishing this series. but the scene where jacks had a scare and he was scared she was dying but she just forgot to breath was so cute i was laughing through my tears at that 🥹🩷i’m disappointed lala didn’t end up punching aurora, which would’ve been fully deserved. we don’t find out anything ab lala besides the fact that she was left alone w aurora after eva left to stop jacks. and it’s clear that she wasn’t punched since she was able to leave lala and distract jacks from finding evangeline. i wonder what’s gonna happen with lala now that she’s done her part helping eva find jacks in their last quest? i feel like it was only a happy conclusion for evajacks and not anyone else who helped them along the way. also i’m so sad she didn’t get a happy ending even after meeting her true love. she truly deserves one and i hope stephanie garber does end up writing another series for her.ˏˋ°•*⁀➷once upon a broken heart - 4.5 starsthe ballad of never after - 4.5 starsa curse for true love - 3.5 starspre-reviewi can’t believe i finished this series. i just know i’m gonna have the biggest hangover over these characters and the world stephanie garber has created 🥹 rtc soon 🤍 but for now i just have to say ‘say don’t go’ by taylor swift is soo evajacks codedreading reviewi’ve been waiting for this day for FUCKING FOREVER and i’m so excited!!pre-read review3 DAYS LEFT!! and i’m going crazy !!!after reading tbonano words will ever describe how badly iNEEDthis book. i understand everyone’s pain now. i desperately need evajacks to be endgame and i’m not accepting anything else.before reading tbonai manifested that this book would come sooner and instead the date levitated farther away",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62816044-a-curse-for-true-love,A Curse for True Love.txt

LIKE ???? ever since i realized this its been tormenting mealso because i love pain, a friendly reminder:""A tormented scream pierced the night like a blade. The sky bled, and darkness fell instead of stars, erasing lights across the Magnificent North.""and""The story curse was familiar with pain, but this was agony, the sort of raw grief that was only seen once in a century. The fate was every tear that anyone had ever shed for lost love. He was pain given form.""and finally""She was crying so hard she could barely see. But she knew that she was alone. Not just alone in this strange place but alone in the world. She felt it down to her bones.""pain😍😍😍_____________________""I'm here, and I'm never going to let you go.""THIS ISNT FUNNY, THIS ISNT THE END THIS LITERALLY CANNOT BE THE END. theres another book i refuse to believe there isnt another one otherwise stephanie garber is officially the #1 most cruelest author of all the authors ive read fromi was this 🤏 close to crying, im going to pretend the last 40ish pages do not exist. that was pure agony im not okay.but other than that devastation (!!) another favourite this was perfection. i love this even more than ouabh. tbona had everything i was so excited for before.ALL THE YEARNING BTWN JACKS AND EVANGELINE SDKHGKS IT WAS TORTURE READING i love them🥹 and just the so many reveals its amazing especially that last one at the end ???CHAOS BEING CASTOR VALOR THE PRINCE AKA THE HANDSOME STRANGER IN THOSE DREAMS ??? I NEVER WOULDVE EXPECTED THAT. i suspected jacks would be the archer but then midway i was doubting myself BUT I WAS RIGHT IN THE END poor jacks killed his first love😭the world was explored so much more (the hollows is officially my favourite place!!) and the finding about the pasts of the valors and jacks omg. and even just getting more screen time of some side characters in the last book !! (major spoilers →i adored apollo's character and felt bad for him UP UNTIL A POINT MY GOD I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT ENDING HE STOLE ALL OF EVANGELINE'S MEMORIES AND THEN HAD THAT FAKE SMILE ON 😃 like i know the price for jacks turning back time to save evangeline was her losing her memories of him (which i still cannot get over i was about to cry) but the fact that he was smiling and acting like everything was alright??? confusion 101. ALSO NOT CHAOS KILLING EVANGELINE🤡🤡 it was an accident but still😭) thank god marisol was barely in here.i literally cannot get enough of jacks and evangeline. their moments <33 the bantering, the soft moments, AND SO MANY TROPES I NEVER KNEW I NEEDED BTWN THEM THAT I GOT SKHGSK LITERALLY WAS SCREAMING. and for a situation where jacks cant kiss anyone bc theyll die, the romance was📈📈i just need to share my favourite moments btwn them so dont click on this if you dont want to get spoiled:""Do you kiss the prince because you actually enjoy it?"" Jacks asked. ""Or is it because you honestly think it will magically revive him?""""Maybe I do it because I know it will annoy you,"" Evangeline answered archly.Jacks flashed a smile that was far more wicked than welcoming. ""Glad to know you're thinking about me when you kiss your husband.""I DIED HERE THE COMEBACK WAS SO SMOOTH HELPand the moment where the""gentle hands instead of harsh ones wrapped protectively around her""and jacks getting angry for evangeline🥺 literally the LOVE there. i love how evangeline felt safe and content in jacks arms always my god i cant with these two.""Everything was fuzzy and distant, but she knew, somehow, that these arms held her closer than the hot arms ever had.""THERE WERE EVEN TWO SCENES WHERE EVANGELINE IS HURT AND JACKS IS THERE RIGHT AWAY TO SAVE HER. and one of those scene was golden, jacks himself nursed her back to health🥹 the softness in jack was so sweet and everything help. literally this was so adorable, seeing this side of jacks:“You’re so good at this” she murmured. “Do you often travel with girls who’ve been flayed?”This earned her a soft laugh. “No.” Then quietly, as he ran a cloth along her lower back, just below the dip in her waist, “would you be jealous if I did?”I’m not a jealous person was what Evangeline intended to say, but instead the words “Of course” came out.Jacks laughed, louder this time.Embarrassment surged through her. ""That's not what I meant to say.""""It's all right. I'd probably kill another man if I found him with you like this""SDKJFGKSHS I LOVE THEM STOPoh oh and then also jacks jumping off a cliff with evangeline and dragging her out of the ocean stubbornly saying""I will not let you die"", this boy is so obviously in love. he's so protective of her, the way he panics seeing evangeline hurt""I know, love. I'm going to take you somewhere safe.""HE CALLED HER ""LOVE"" JACKS CALLED EVANGELINE LOVE I WAS SCREAMING AND STILL AM SDJGHKSHG[Evangeline] ""Do you still think of me as just a tool?""Jacks frowned. ""I try not to think of you at all.""i-🥹🥹🥹Jacks's chest was heaving, his clothes were soaked, his hair was a mess across his face--yet in that moment, Evangeline knew he would carry her through more than just freezing waters. He would pull her through fire if he had to, haul her from the clutches of war, from falling cities and breaking worlds.I AM DEAD DECEASED CRYING THEY'RE JUST MEANT FOR EACH OTHERbut of all of these THIS WAS OFC MY FAVOURITE""It's just one night.

TAKE ME BACK TO THIS MOMENT. TAKE ME BACK. im going to cry jacks admitting all this.""He held her so tightly it hurt, but this pain she didn’t mind. She’d let him crush her, let him break her, just as long as he never let her go. This was what she wanted, and she refused to believe that he didn’t want it, too.""seeing this after the end hurts more than i ever couldve imagined i really will never be okay what happened to the happy moments ???no because i literally have 5 pages of notes on a word doc, i could go on forever but im going to stop before i start crying again.and i just need to share some of my other favourite quotes these were so beautiful:""The secret to staying in love is having someone who will catch you when you start to fall out of it. And I promise to always catch you.""""Happy endings can be caught, but they are difficult to hold on to. They are dreams that want to escape the night. They are treasure with wings.. They are wild, feral, reckless things that need to be constantly chased, or they will certainly run away.""""She used to think love was like a house. Once it was built, a person got to live in it forever. But now she wondered if love was more like a war with new foes constantly appearing and battles creeping up. Winning at love was less about succeeding in a battle and more about continuing a fight, to choose the person you loved as the one you were willing to die for, over and over.""AND THEN THESE TWO HAD TO GO AND DESTROY ME😃That is not a small mistake to fix. If you do this, Time will take something equally valuable from you.""""There is nothing of equal value to me.""HAHAHA STOP IM GOING TO CRY HE SAID IT HIMSELF.

Believe Me,"✨aaron warner and juliette ferrars invented the definition of soulmatism✨i don’t even know where to start, i’m an emotional mess but the feeling of euphoria that came over me whilst reading believe me is simply unmatched. i went through a stampede of emotions, i was literally crying, smiling, and laughing through the whole novella and sometimes all at the same time. it feels like an end of an era and i’m so not ready to let go! i could feel warnette’s love seeping through the pages which made me pause reading so many times because it was just overwhemingly beautiful and adorable. i fell head over heels in love with these characters and the world several years ago and it still has such a massive hold over me. it has always been one of my favourite series’ and will continue to be! it’s been such a wild journey and i’m so freaking sad it’s finished! but honestly, this novella was truly a glorious and beautiful way to end a mind blowing series. tahereh knew how dissatisfied we were with imagine me and then delivered perfection with believe me!“I don’t care, love. I don’t care about any of it. I just want you. I want you to be my family.”i feel as though i have underestimated my love for warnette, everything i felt for them before was nothing compared to my absolute love for them now.“You all insult him over and over again and he just takes it—he doesn’t even say anything—and somehow you’ve convinced yourselves it’s okay. Why? He’s a real, flesh-and-blood person. Why don’t you care? Why don’t you think he has feelings? What the hell is wrong with you?”i was shouting along with juliette when she told the others to stop bullying our man!! We witnessed a vulnerable warner and it was gut wrenching but i loved seeing that side of him!“I take a deep, shaky breath. I don’t know what to do with my arms, or my legs. They feel prickly suddenly; all pins and needles. I want to tear them off my body.I’m staring at the ground when I say, “Have you changed your mind? About marrying me?”it was truly heartbreaking to see warner second guessing everything, been uncertain and just feeling like he’s unworthy of everything, especially juliette’s love. This is what i was waiting for. I wanted to delve into his mind since we didn’t have that opportunity in imagine me. We got to be in his head as he felt more vulnerable than he ever has before and it was beautiful. there’s so much growth to these characters and it just brings tears to my eyes when i think about everything they went through! warner and juliette were destined to be soul mates and this novella reinforced that. warner has the biggest heart and i wish he was able to see himself in her eyes, his devotion to her is awe-inspiring.“I would sleep on the cold floor of our hospital room for the rest of my life if it meant staying by Ella’s side. I can forgo quiet. I can compartmentalize my need for space. My desire for privacy.But to lose her—”warner in disbelief that the surprise wedding was planned in advance was so sweet because he couldn’t fathom why everyone would do this for him. I love that man i really do“I shake my head. “It wasn’t about me. My experience doesn’t matter—”“Of course it does. It matters to me. You don’t get to be the only one who worries about the person you love. I get to do that, too,” she says, breaking away to better look me in the eye. “You spend so much time thinking about what’s best for me. You’re always worried about my safety and my happiness and the things I might need. Why don’t I get to do that for you? Why don’t I get to think about your happiness?”“I am happy, love,” I say quietly. “You make me happy.”also, WARNETTE SMUT???? IT WAS SO UNEXPECTED BUT SO FUCKING GOOD. I DIDN’T KNOW HOW MUCH I NEEDED THAT BEFORE READING IT🥵“Please,” she says, still touching me. “Aaron—”I sink down, without warning, onto my knees. Ella steps back, confused for all of a second before her eyes widen with understanding.“Come here, love.”and they really would’ve had sex in graveyard if it wasn’t for kenji😂this novella had such entertaining scenes especially the scenes between kenji, winston and warner. also, when warner said to kenji if he’s coming to stand beside him at the wedding. WHEN I TELL YOU I CRIED LIKE A LITTLE BABY. These two came such a long way and i don’t care what anyone says they’re best friends!! (obviously juliette is #1 bestie to both guys lol)I’m trying, but I can’t stop laughing.“Huh,” says Winston quietly. “I didn’t even know his face could do that.”“Yeah,” Kenji says. “It’s super weird the first time you see it.”“I can’t look away. I’m trying to look away and I can’t. It’s like if a baby was born with a full set of teeth.”“Yes! Exactly. It’s exactly like that!”“But nice, too.”“Yeah.” Kenji sighs. “Nice, too.”“Hey, did you know he had dimples? I didn’t know he had dimples.”- warner having a favourite flower shouldn’t even be surprising at this point😂🥰and WE GOT TO SEE WARNER WITH A DOG!!!“Does he have a name?” she’d asked.“He is a dog,” I’d said, frowning as I looked up. “You may call him a dog.”that man is so funny, he’s so fucking adorable!“Her faint, almost undetectable note of jealousy— possessiveness—only cements my smile in place.”- warner being happy over juliette’s jealousy was actually the cutest- warner ready to kill kenji for ruining juliette’s dress-warner being more obsessed than juliette over her having the perfect wedding dress.. my fashion king only wants the best and im here for it- the realisation that kenjinazeera will be his neighbours😂“A dangerous heat builds behind my eyes and I force myself to fight it back, to remain calm, but when she sees me, she smiles—and I nearly lose the fight.“I told you it was a nice dress,” Kenji whispers.“Kenji.”“Yes?”“Thank you,” I say, still staring at Ella. “For everything.”i knew he’d be close to crying when he saw juliette walking down the aisle. and this novella confirmed that kenji and warner are besties🥺they explicitly and implicitly promised to love and be there for each other through their actions and words throughout the novella. They anticipated each other’s needs. We may have not got the traditional wedding vows we wanted but the declarations of their love were tied to everything that they did for one another and that in itself was all the vows I needed and it was beautiful. they both are so fucking pure and deserve everything and more!! As we know, warner and juliette would always find themselves back to each other. No matter how many times their memories were erased, they always were drawn back together and fall in love every single time. For juliette, Aaron Warner Anderson is the only emotional through line in her life that ever made sense. He's the only constant. The only steady, reliable heartbeat she’s ever had. and for warner, she is his whole damn world.of course I needed more, I wanted warnette honeymoon and babies but I can only hope that tahereh has plans to write another novella in a few years, and I’ll be waiting!! i have been bursting at the seams with excitement ever since this novella was announced and i am so deliriously happy with it🤍as juliette once said, i feel like i’ve been split open and stuffed with sunshine.✨✨WARNETTE NOVELLA CONFIRMED!!!!✨✨AND IT'S FROM WARNER'S POV!! who else is crying with me??? can't wait to see warner referring to juliette as his wife all the time, it's going to make my heart sing🦋😭""Believe me is the devastatingly romantic fifth novella in the New York Times and USA Today bestselling SHATTER ME series, chronicling the events after IMAGINE ME, the explosive sixth novel.""I AM ON CLOUD FUCKING NINE!! aaron warner, the most precious and softest man to ever exist is back! he is my soulmate, my religion, my reason for breathing, my lifeline, my love and i can't believe he's back! tahereh has given us the most incredible gift🥳🥳🥳we get to finally witness kenji walking juliette down the aisle, tears streaming down warner's face but has the biggest smile as he watches the love of his entire life running towards him in a beautiful wedding gown and a kenji struggling to keep up with the glowing bride!! warnette wedding vows. warner bullying kenji. warner and a dog. unhinged warner. soft warner. kenji and nazeera. warner, james and kenji content. warnette baby. warnette dates. warnette cuddles. warnette fluff. just all things domestic and warnette. the loves of my life!💖NOVEMBER 16th, 2021.

Once Upon a Broken Heart,"To put it simply,Once Upon a Broken Heartis a hot mess. The premise promises a fairytale, but what Garber delivers is a confused nightmare. With an annoyingly-naïve protagonist, a one-dimensional cast of supporting characters and a truly “what the fuck”-inducing plot, this book’s only saving graces are the short chapters and fast pacing, which at times can too be a hindrance to your enjoyment and desire to rate this book higher than you actually will.The beginning chapters of this book are the only thing that delivers on the premise. With vivid imagery, they instantly drew me in and I could see the improvement in Garber’s writing from the six (boring) chapters I had read ofCaraval. (As you can guess, that didn’t last very long).Once Upon a Broken Heartfollows rose gold-haired Evangeline Fox, whose stepsister is set to marry Luc, her one true love. Believing Luc to be cursed and desperate to stop the wedding, she enlists the help of Jacks, a Fate and the Prince of Hearts. He agrees to do so under the condition that Evangeline will kiss 3 people of his choosing, but doesn’t say any more than that. Willing to do whatever it takes to stop Luc marrying Marisol, she agrees to the deal but the wedding is stopped by Jacks turning everyone to stone. It is here that Evangeline first displays her wishy-washy personality, as she regrets her actions and drinks the poison that turned the bride, groom and wedding guests to stone – thereby taking their place.Evangeline, as a protagonist and narrator, frustrated me endlessly. She’sinsanelynaïve, always trusting people she shouldn’t and wanting to help Marisol (her stepsister) when it’svery obviousthat a) her sister is shady and up to no good and b) she generally has no reason to. The two of them have next to no relationship, but because Evangeline is so Wonderful and Perfect and Special Because She Has Pink Hair, of course she has to want to help. She’s also a very passive character: things happentoher, notbecauseof her. Now, I know what you’re probably thinking: “Characters are allowed to be naïve! It’s part of their growth!” or “Characters are allowed to be nice! They don’t all have to be sword-wielding assassins or (insert other character trope here)”. Trust me, I hear you, but there’s a difference betweenthose charactersand Evangeline Fox.The side characters – yes, including Jacks – in this book are no better. They’re all one-dimensional and flat, having one ‘unique’ aspect about them… and that’s it. I could tell you hardly anything about them. Jacks’ past with Donatella is briefly mentioned, but I wouldn’t really class that as him having personality, and I think it’s more fanservice for existingCaravalfans than anything.I can separate this book into two parts: Before Evangeline Drinks the Poison and After Evangeline Drinks the Poison. I enjoyed the Before part, as After Evangeline Drinks the Poison is where Stephanie Garber seems to have forgotten the novel she promised to readers, and began writing something else entirely. Ergo, the plot had gone haywire.The book’s plot follows no clear structure; it’s all over the place. Sure, there’s a little bit of “action” but that does nothing to redeem a story that is 99% Boring and 1% Interesting Scenes. There were numerous attempts at romantic scenes throughout the book, but Evangeline has no real chemistry with either of her potential love interests (one of them is literally cursed to be in love with her, so there’s that), so it did nothing for me and I skim-read most of them.Once Upon a Broken Hearttook an extremely bizarre turn after the introduction of vampires. Yes, you read that correctly. Vampires. What the fuck are vampires doing in this book? It was so completely and utterly random, I was honestly thinking ‘what was Stephanie Garber on when she wrote this?’ while reading. We were given no real explanation as to why vampires were included either. It was like a complete abuse of authorial power on Garber’s part: she thought vampires were cool, soshe just put them in the book, with no real thought as to the sense (or lack thereof) it would make. And trust me, it madezero sense. Unfortunately, around the last third of the book and its “plot” hinges on vampires, so there wasn’t any escaping them.There was also a prophecy subplot, becauseof course there was. The prophecy in this book centres around the Valory Arch, a mysterious archway in The North which contains either treasure and secrets or deadly monsters (no one is really sure which). Evangeline, having such Main Character Energy, is the key to unlocking this arch/doorway (I get she literally IS the main character, but just roll with the punches here). I say it’s a subplot, but I honestly couldn’t tell you what was the main plot and what were subplots in this book. Garber weaved a lot of threads throughoutOnce Upon a Broken Heart, and they got tangled up at times.As a ‘minor’ complaint, a lot is told to readers and not shown. For instance, after Evangeline has just woken up from being poisoned, she is told of a Week of Terrors that unfolded after the cancelled wedding, but we’re not given any information about it. Later, through dialogue, Evangeline learns of information she needs to know to progress the plot, but it’s done in quite a heavy-handed manner. There’sa lotof it, and wasn’t done subtlety or in small pieces, like you might see elsewhere in other novels.To give myself something positive to say about this book, I did like its short chapters and relatively fast pacing. As a slow reader, I appreciated being able to get through this book super quickly. Yes, that’s all I have to say. Moving on!The book ends on a cliffhanger. It’s somewhat intriguing, but I certainly won’t be reading the sequel. If for whatever reason, after reading this review, you’re still inclined to readOnce Upon a Broken Heart, you might want to hold off on doing so until the sequel is out, as this will leave you with too many loose plot threads and unanswered questions – more than any book should.Thank you to Kate Keehan and Hodder & Stoughton for the eARC!↠ 1 starBookstagram✦BookTwitter✦BookTok15/04/2024: I'm far too late in adding this, but if you're looking for a YA fantasy series (with enemies to lovers, morally grey characters, and corruption arcs) that will actually be worth your time, may I direct your attention toThe Kinder Poisonby Natalie Mae!",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55987278-once-upon-a-broken-heart,Once Upon a Broken Heart.txt
One True King,"✨ April 27th, 2020 ✨These books have been so formative to me as a reader, writer, and person for so many years, and it’s surreal to realize that the series ends in just a month and a few days. I’ve grown up hand in hand with these characters— I’ve navigated new school hallways with my paperback carefully tucked in my bag, made my first internet friends in forums on the author’s website, and traveled to my first book conventions in New York City and Charleston because of these stories. Over the years, I’ve recognized so many facets of myself in Sophie, Agatha, and Tedros, and I’ve found my own insecurities and conflicts mirrored in their relationships with one another. I’ve taken solace in their beauty and imperfections, appreciating the validation that their duality brought to me during those scary and magical moments that define growing up.Now, as I graduate high school and prepare to begin college in the fall, it only makes sense that my childhood friends also graduate school and prepare to face the woods ahead of them, but that doesn’t make this release date all feel any less strange. I’m going to miss these kids. <3✨June 3rd, 2020✨I finished the book at 1:30 am last night, and oh my god, I sobbed! I genuinely could not have dreamed of a better conclusion to this series, and I feel so grateful to have gotten such a good ending to a story that matters this much to me. The book was beautiful, bittersweet, satisfying, and so, so rewarding.It’s been a heavy and challenging year for everyone -- I mean, I was supposed to have my graduation ceremony last night. I've been struggling to get myself moving forward again in the absence of normal rituals, but I think this book is what I needed to finally feel ready for whatever comes next. Closing the back cover of One True King felt an awful lot like closing this chapter of my life -- like some sense of closure.I really owe so much to this story.✨June 8th, 2020✨Okay, initial heartache and nostalgia aside, there's so much gold in this book to dig up and appreciate, and I think I'm finally in the right headspace to do so! Yay! I might even take a highlighter and pen to my copy for annotating in a week or two... just no one tell my 13-year-old self, who I can already hear shrieking in the back of my mind ""bOOK CRIME!""SPOILERS AHEAD. CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED. <3One True King definitely abides by its infamous SGE branding and supplies many wild twists and turns. Even the few events and deaths that I knew absolutely had to happen were written in such a creative and backwards way that when they did unfold, I still found myself surprised. To name one in particular...M E R L I NIt's no surprise that Merlin is a favorite of mine (you can find me on Instagram as @merlins_celestium), but still, I knew he couldn't survive the ending. That's just the way of middle grade and young adult literature: the main character(s) lose their mentors before or during the final battle. We've seen this happen numerous times before in SGE with Professor Sader, Lady Lesso, Callis, and Professor Dovey, and Agatha even makes a point of it while sitting with Guinevere (who also meets a tragic end, yikes) in One True King by remarking on how cruel her fairytale is to the grown-ups.And yet, Soman didn't kill off Merlin in the first few chapters, like I had expected him to. Instead, he limited Merlin's ability to aid the protagonists in their tests with the aging spell and kept wizard alive untilliterally the last line of the book. Not only was this trick smart and admirable, but aging Merlin backwards was one of my favorite parts of the story. It was immensely amusing to watch Agatha and Tedros try to parent (their old teacher, nonetheless), and Merlin's commentary as he grew older added so much to scenes and dialogue. It also made me realize what a terrific mother Agatha would make, which was so lovely to seewithoutany sort of cheesy and overdone epilogue.This all goes to say that when Merlin eventually did die at the end, I actually found myself surprised! Even though this was the one thing I went into the book expecting would happen, I got so caught up in the story and Merlin's hilarious adventures as a teenager that I completely forgot that his time as an old man was dwindling and that couldn’t, in fact, survive the book. And I don't know if anyone else had this experience, but his death reminded me an awful lot of the end of Les Mis? Whatever truly did me in, I ugly cried for those last two pages. ""The work is done?"" Damn.T E D R O SFor me, the more I love something, the harder I find it to explain why. So, this section will be short.Tedros definitely wasn't my favorite character at the start of the series, but the Camelot Years really fleshed him out and showed us a side to him that had me 100% falling in love. These three books became his coming-of-age saga, and he's grown so much from the insecure and foolish little boy that we first met back in book one -- it warms my heart so much. I amfiercelyproud of everything that he has accomplished over the course of all six books, and goddamnit, he deserves that crown. Camelot is lucky to have him as a leader. (He even pulled a f*ucking Jesus in the end! Holy cow! He did that! )I wish I could give him a hug. :’)R E L A T I O N S H I P SSpeaking of Tedros, the Tagatha in this novel was TOP NOTCH. These kids have been endgame since book one, but the last few installments to the series really put their relationship through the wringer. All of the bickering and miscommunication has Not been cute. I’m so happy that this book focused so much on them developing trust in their relationship, which was so sorely needed, and I was impressed by how well they grew together as a team. I finally feel confident that they're fit to rule a kingdom. They’ve learned a lot, and it’s so nice to see them happy. Merlin put it perfectly: they really are such wondrous souls. I think they'll make great rulers, and maybe parents, too.(That was a joke. Please. They can wait. They're, like, 17 or something. Please let them wait.)Not to mention, we finally got Hophie! I know that this pairing is somewhat controversial among readers, but I've been waiting on their ship to sail for years, so don't you DARE ruin this moment for me. This is the ending that Sophie deserved, that Hort deserved, and that we all deserved. You can’t convince me otherwise. I'm also stillsofragile from Hort's near-death experience, so just, don't talk to me for a while. Thank you.And FINALLY. THE MOMENT THAT WE’VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR. Hester and Anadil. That's it. That's the review. I've been dying for confirmation on their relationship ever since all of their ridiculous flirting in the Ever Never Handbook, and I'm thrilled that we finally got it carved in as canon. Their banter in this book was amazing, incredible, show-stopping, marvelous, and had me swooning and giggling on every other page. All the ""Ew, like an Ever Boy?"" comments killed me, and all I have to say is that I better be invited to the wedding.S U R P R I S E SRafal being revealed as Japeth and Rhian's father hit me like a ton of bricks. Not only was I a) unabashedly shocked and b) horrified for poor Sophie, but also c) I felt absolutely awful for Rhian, who was lied to his entire life. I wish we could have resurrectedhim, Jesus Christ (pun intended). He really deserved better.Speaking of characters who deserved better, once the Queen referred to her daughter as Betty, I immediately made the connection to Bettina, and I had a sinking suspicion that things couldn't end well for her. We needed her Mother on our side, and Japeth murdering her daughter was quite effective in doing that. That said, I really wish we had gotten more of her character! She was really only alive for 20 pages before she kicked the bucket, but I still managed to absolutely fall in love with her. So. Who wants to start a Bettina and Rhian Deserved Better Campaign with me? We meet tomorrow at dawn.I also did NOT expect Chaddick to be the eldest son of King Arthur. Yes, it makes perfect sense in hindsight, and I feel like an absolute fool for not realizing it earlier, but oh my god.C L O S U R EOverall, the vibes in this book? Were immaculate. I haven't felt as blissfully immersed in a story as I did while reading this one for maybe years. The writing is just that phenomenal. When I read the last half for the first time on Tuesday night, the events felt so real, it was as if I were actually in the story. I completely forgot I was reading. I don't know when I’ll get to feel that way about a book next, as it’s been so long, but it was amazing while it lasted. These books are actual magic.I was also pleasantly surprised by how many loose ends were tied up, considering the scope of this series. The few things that were left unanswered felt purposeful and right, and the ending felt perfect. I liked that it still left a dash of mystery in its wake, since what the book chose to focus on and end with felt more powerful.This isn’t even to mention all the small moments throughout the book that made me pause to smile or cry. Hester responding to Dot's discovery about being Half-Ever with ""Nobody's perfect"" made me melt. Merlin's flashback to his last time with Tedros in the Ender Forest made me sob. Sophie picking up the piece of cake was so simple, yet so heartfelt! I find it funny that it’s these quiet moments that define as epic of a series as the School for Good and Evil for me, but it’s true -- they really do. These books make the most ambitious and grand fairytales feel magically intimate and personal for its readers. I’m sure Agatha and Sophie would be proud.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45343240-one-true-king,One True King.txt
Find Me,"*** This review contains spoilers for both novellas that are in this bind-up ***Rating: 🌟🌟🌟 (3/5 stars).I feel like I have been such a fan of the shatter me for such a long time and like somehow I read this newer trilogy (or like the newer books) when my life is always messed up and family drama is around. Haha, somehow that happened again when I read this book. I always knew I wanted to read this when both short stories were out and before the last book in this series came out. And that what I did. I will have some thoughts about both short stories down below.Thoughts about Shadow Me:Kenji's point of view was cute but in all honesty his novella was kind of pointless😂I am intrigued about Nouria now and Kenji officially has re-invoked my sympathy for Adam. Also, I will always and forever think Kenji is such a real chaotic bi disaster and it's so sad to hear that my puppy bear is struggling with his mental health too. Oh and I still love Warner to death.Thoughts about Reveal Me:I liked this second novella so much more than the first one. I also somehow didn´t know this one would be from Kenji´s point of view too so I was really shocked (and happy) when I found I would get more of Kenji. I truly felt bad for the sweetest puppy Kenji and I also somehow completely forgot Nouria was Castle´s daughter. I am still not sure how I feel about Kenji´s budding romance with Nezeera. I am not hating it but I am also not liking it. Warner and Juliette are still absolutely the cutest and I barely could handle them. ALSO THANK YOU KENJI FOR CARING ABOUT BOTH ADAM AND JAMES, LIKE I WAS SCREAMING TOO THAT THEY WEREN´T THERE. Also what the actual fuck happened at the end. Tahereh Mafi you simply just can´t end your novella like that. SERIOUSLY YOU CAN´T, IT DESTROYED ME. I actually thought this one was pretty good unlike the previous one (Shadow me which was really pointless and unnecessary). Also, my puppy, the sweetest, the babe Kenji really deserves ALL THE HAPPINESS. AND MY POOR BABY! I REALLY CARE ABOUT YOU! Lol, I don´t really care that much about Juliette anymore since I think her character kind of got butchered in the last few books and now I am basically still reading it for Warnette, Warner, Kenji & James content. Also, I am actually liking and caring for Adam again. I don´t think he deserved the hate he got.I am truly not ready for this series to end again. I might not love the newer books as much as I love the OG books but I still really enjoy them. I honestly cannot wait to read Imagine Me but I am also terrified to read this. I thought the first novella was kind of pointless and didn´t really do anything but I have to say the second one was really good and pretty important to read. Haha, my advice would be skip reading Shadow Me and simply read Reveal Me.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43521352-find-me,Find Me.txt
Finale,"4.5 stars""Before Legend, Tella had wanted nothing to do with love. She’d believed she was destined to only experience unrequited love. Then she’d fallen in love with him, and it had been like drinking magic—indescribable, all-consuming, and fantastically addictive.”“I choose you, Julian, and I promise I will always choose you, and I will always love you. I will love you with every bone in my body, so that even after my heart stops beating, a part of me will remain to forever love you.”i never expected to like this trilogy as much as i did. i am never getting over these characters and the world stephanie garber has built. this book absolutely delivered! it was a beautiful ending and it felt so painful to get through the book as it continued. i can definitely see how the writing has improved since the first book, caraval.the beginning was so intriguing. the problem i had with legendary was the fact that it was hard to get through the beginning but i liked the start of this one!! it had a bit of suspense added to it and I loved how it jumped right in. this book was everything from the execution to the plot!! it felt as though i wasn’t as bored with this book which i loved. this book made up for what the other books lacked (for the most part) from the mystery to the romance aspect! i think this book definitely helped balance out both of these factors while making it simultaneously interestingthe ratio between scarlett and tella chapters were so off. it was unfair how my girl scarlett didn’t get as many chapters as tella and they were so short!! i think that tella’s pov was more tolerable in this book than the others. however the ending did serve scarlett justice & i love her with my entire heart. she deserved so much more in this book after everything she went through. i think that she truly had character development towards the end. the beginning with scarlett was something that i wasn’t a big fan of simply bc of the way she changed and how they treated julian’s love as if it did not have real meaning.spoiler mentioned!in the beginning, every scene with the count i absolutely hated. he felt like an unneeded factor in the story between julian & scarlett. it was so sad to see how scarlett pretended to not love him anymore. i’m all for improvement but this felt like a step backwards for scarlett. i am so glad the count died when he did bc he gave me scarlettjulian back!! one thing i am in disbelief that they held off mentioning previously was the fact thatjulian wears glasses?!!?i literally fainted the moment i read that bc it made me love him more.more quotes to showcase my love for scarlett & julian <3“He smelled like dirt and tears and perfection. And she decided then that she was never, ever letting go of him. She wished there was a way to tether her heart to his, so that even when they were apart they would still be attached. There were things in this world to be truly afraid of, but loving Julian was not one of them.” 💞“I don’t need to prove anything,” said julian. “I’m not trying to win her hand. I’m offering her mine, and everything that comes with it, hoping she’ll take it and decides she wants to keep it.”“I’ve always been yours, crimson.”scarlettjulian’s reunion was my absolute favorite in this book.HE GOT A FREAKING TATTOO THE COLOR CRIMSON!! i was sobbing when i read this scene bc they hold such a special place in my heart it’s surreal. I couldn’t even see straight as i read bc of the tears streaming my cheeks at how much i loved them. i can go on and on abt how much i love them“She couldn’t bring herself to say the word mother. It hurt too much to cry out the way she had as a child and to hear no response. She’d vowed never to do it again.”spoiler for this quote!!“This had to be a mistake. She already had one murderous, power-hungry father. She didn’t deserve another one”the pain in this book was everything. it captured the characters emotions beautifully and i feel like it portrayed the thoughts and feelings so accurately from the grief they experienced to the way they described it!! i found myself crying multiple times throughout this book which is a rare occurrence. this book practically ruined me as i read it but i don’t regret it one bit. tella didn’t get on my nerves as much within this book and i think it’s true character development on her part.“His steady gaze held hers as if he had no intention of ever looking away—as if maybe he’d been telling the truth when he’d said that he wanted to keep her here forever.”“Julian might not have been perfect, but he was perfect for her sister”I ate upEVERYscene between all the characters. the romance within this book was absolutely impeccable!! it brought not only pain but it also brought sadness along with it. it felt like an emotional roller coaster throughout! one thing i found to be weird was how both legend AND jacks wanted to possess her? it felt as though she was an object rather than a human which was kinda sad to think about.spoiler alert from this point onokay so this book talked abt how the fates were hated but they were literally amazing?! it felt as if they were one friend group when they joined together to help save scarlett which i absolutely loved. the assassin was a dark character but he was lowkey funny?? not to mention the maiden death deserved so much better as a character. i swear every fate i read abt was amazing!! I was honestly sad to find out anissa betrayed scarlett but ultimately i still liked her as a character. PLUS the poison was such a good fate. despite him turning humans into stones, he was so charming from the beginning!!there’s something about grand death scenes within this book that i loved. stephanie did every single one of these characters justice!! they were written so amazingly, including the fallen star’s. it was so beautiful to see that scarlett didn’t need to be anyone but herself in order to convince him to turn human. not to mention the scene where tella stabbed jacks to break their bond ☹️ the writing was so meaningful and everything with each of these scenes.“He was an immortal who couldn’t die but who could never fully live, because the things he wanted to consume were devouring him instead.”i’m honestly so sad abt how tella and jacks’s story ended. the way i would’ve immediately chosen jacks over legend given the opportunity.. i thought they had amazing chemistry from the very beginning and even though i do love tella and legend, I feel like they ruined jacks’ character towards the end with each betrayal on top of another. my favorite scene between them was when he helped take her pain away bc it felt as though the tension was palpable. it was so well written!! i wish we got to know more abt the ending to tella & jacks’s story. still upset she chose someone who was so bland from the very beginning“She’d loved him as Dante, but she loved him even more as Legend. Dante had helped her forget, but Legend had taught her how to dream again, and she loved all the dazzling dreams they shared and the exquisite lies he told with his illusions. But she loved the imperfect truth of him just as much.”“He didn’t kiss her as if he’d simply just come back to life. He kissed her as if he’d died, been buried, and clawed his way out of the grave and through the dirt just to get to her.”“This is my choice, and I choose you, Donatella. I don’t need immortality. You’re my forever.”anyways, i still did like tella and legend together. it felt as though every scene they shared had so much more meaning than with tella and jacks. i am content with the ending but i truly wish we got more of them together. she was everything i wanted to be within this book. she was brave, and she had the ability to be selfless within this book. legend’s confession had me bawling bc i loved them so much after everything they’ve been through. it was honestly my favorite scene between them out of all the other ones within this book! towards the end, i was laughing through my tears when i read abt the letter she wrote to legend.the miscommunication with tella and legend felt repetitive. with every contemporary book i’ve witnessed, they all had repetition and miscommunication to drag on with the story. for this book, it was justified but it kinda felt annoying to be constantly reminded that legend didn’t love her. this was where i didn’t like their story as much bc they were also both stubborn.moving on to the flaws:okay so number 1 - the debt she owed to the vanished market? it was practically scraped, an incomplete idea with no ending. i found for there to be no purpose bc it was never mentioned after they interacted basically. number 2 - they brushed over legend’s identity? last book, they talked about scarlett having no idea who legend was and in this book they don’t even have this grand reveal. they played down his identity and it just gets ignored that he is legend. this book was just a little confusing with these factors added in. i honestly expected these things to be addressed but i was kinda disappointed they weren’t ??series review! `✦ ˑ ִֶ 𓂃⊹✩caravallegendaryspectacular",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40381392-finale,Finale.txt
A Crystal of Time,"This book was full of surprisingly great but unexpected turns.Rhian kills Japeth.Sophie kills Rhian.But nooooo. Sophie started to TRULY love Rhian and Rhian to ADORE Sophie. They were so great togheter, after Sophie ""betrayed"" Tedros and Agatha. I never saw that in Rhian. In the 4th book he was too good to be true, so there surely was something rotten in him. But actually, he tried to take his rightful throne. If I discovered I could take the throne and that I AM the rightful heir, I would have gone for it! Even if Rhian didn't play fair, lying and putting his *spat* twin *spat* to do the so called sacking of the kingdoms he still addimtted he wanted a better place. Even if the Woods were already perfect (except Tedros' coronation and getting the sword out of the stone and that stuff). The Storian had all the right to live, and yes, he could have talked to Tedros and convinced him, to try and pull the sword without the stupid game of the Lion and the Snake. ""Stupid"" will sound really mean, but it was horrible, really. Lying all the game and putting alies of you on the evil part and good part so you could win. Dirty thing for a king, if you ask me. But still, Rhian had a GOOD vision in mind. He wasn't evil after all. He even accepted not killing Tedros until some of the prisoners escaped with the help from Sophie and Agatha (Sophie messaged Agatha) and interrupted their wedding.But nooo.JAPETH kills Rhian.Sophie is traumatized.And Tedros thinks she betrayed him (like usual)""Now I see why every boy falls in love with you"" - RhianPleaseeeee.First dumping.Now falling in love.Sophie, you got the right one.GO GIRL!!And the part with Sophie tricking Kei on the carriage and making him tell her about Rhian and Japeth. Please. She's a model.And Aja! All my RESPECT!Bodhi and Lathain.... Please, leave Priyanka alone. Don't you see Sophie?? SHE'S WAY BETTER! (I hope they are her age or older :|)The book was sooo dramatic and the next generation is introduced better and plays a part in this book. I just love them all. But Sophie is the best.She is my favourite character from the first book. I always thought I will like Agatha but no. Sophie suffered so much and Agatha hadn't done anything. I will explain.Well in the first book, I wanted so bad Sophie to be with Tedros that I was just crushed when I saw Agatha with him. I was just ready to give up the book. That because I wanted to give Tedros one more shot to choose Sophie. She cheated. She wanted to win him unfair. And she didn't save him in the confrontation with Hester in The Trial by Tale. Still, how could he POSSIBLY CHOOSE AGATHA?! I mean, I understand she save your life and everything, but that doesn't mean she loves you for the true you. It was the first time Agatha actually interacted pozitivly with him and after that: Agatha sees the real me and she doesn't love my for my looks, she loves my for my personality! TEDROS DEAR, SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW YOU! And with that, Agatha dumps Sophie, Tedros dumps Sophie, Sophie remains behind with all the pain, carrying the worst feelings in her life, being destroyed, and STILL she doesn't kill Tedros or Agatha even if she is pure Evil and everything. She just tries, okay? But then, surprise, she dies! And Agatha chose her. Good choice.Second book was my favourite.Still, Agatha chose Tedros. Sophie and Agatha return to School for Good and Evil, the School being school for girls and boys as their fairytale reopens.And Sophie tries to stop Agatha from meeting Tedros so she wouldn't be alone for the rest of her life. I find it really fair. But Agatha meets Tedros and Sophie follows her and stops her when she is in the School Master's tower with Tedros by throwing between them a pink flash. Agatha thinks Tedros attacked her. Tedros thinks Agatha attacked him. A lot of things happen and Sophie turns into Filip going to the school for boys to find the Storian and seal her story and Agatha's. Meanwhile Tedros fells in love with Filip as they spend their time by talking about their parents. In the Trial by Tale Agatha founds Sophie and Tedros togheter, Sophie being Filip and tells Tedros who Sophie really is. Even if Sophie hadn't done anything wrong, she was a great friend, Tedros hated her even more and went to Agatha. Sophie is dumped again just because she was Good. Just because she saved Tedros' life. Just because she brought him food. Just because she listened to him like Agatha never did. Just because she simply tried to make him happy. So she chose Rafal. Obviously. If someone loves you, you go to that someone. You go to the one that appreciates you, not to the one who disconsiders you. Brilliant. I wouldn't return to my friends that always dump me and treat my like I'm an animal or something. Or that simply use me for their own good.I'm the third book Sophie is almost happy with Rafal. Almost. She still thinks (because of the ring too) that she should be with Tedros. Of course, everything Rafal said to her about what her life would be if she followed Agatha and Tedros was true. I mean, she would be excluded. They have each other, and as we seen in the other books they don't actually appreciate Sophie. But for SOME REASON they need her. To make peace between them. To help them get over their problems togheter. That because, without Sophie, they can't be togheter. They will always be mad at each other like we saw in the begining of the third book. I saw this really really different from how Agatha and Tedros thought about it. You see, Sophie should abandon Rafal, the only person that loves her (let's let Hort out of the subject for a little while) and go to them so she could make their love stronger? She should abandon her life for them? And STILL she doesn't get anything in exchange? She has to trail after them like an animal for emotional support? I can't belive they even SUGGESTED AND THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. SOPHIE HAS A LIFE OF HER OWN, YOU KNOW. After she destroys Rafals ring, the ending is just gorgeous. She has herself. Because no one can really understand her (except Bodhi, Lathain, Rhian, Kei etc😂👌) And SURPRISE! She doesn't go with Agatha and Tedros to Camelot. Good choice.But, there is a fourth book. I appreciate Tedros for that thought, that he thinks he can't be in the same room without killing each other, kissing each other or a lot of people being dead. KISSING EACH OTHER. A really nice thought, right? Sophie should know about that. Now, Hort jumps to another girlfriend. Nicola. I don't like her. Something is wrong with her. She always has to prove how smart she is or to show off. Leave Sophie and Hoort alone! Hort is the only one she actually had until The Lion came in. Rhian. Too good to be true till she hold a sword to her spine. AND TEDROS STILL thinks Sophie is betraying the. He ALWAYS has that thought in mind. I really don't know what he got, these days...In the fifth book I love how Sophie tries to charm Rhian. And it eventually works. Too bad that right in that day he is killed by Japeth. So no one for Sophie again. And Tedros is still thinking Sophie is betraying him and Agatha. I wonder if he knows he is not the only one Sophie thinks about from the Woods. We will sure find out. Then the part with Kei as I said is ABSOLUTELY GREAT. I love how Sophie accepts herself and she really uses what she has. Now, one more thing I loved about the 5th book is how Tedros teases Sophie and Sophie teases back. AND how Hort and Tedros started to fight in the dungeon over Sophie. Fair enough to me :)So Sophie suffered a lot just because she did GOOD.That's why I like her. She deserves to win. But right know, that can't happen. Sophie worked a lot for her place that she still doesn't have. She went through everything with suffer. She always suffers in the dark. Alone.Then Agatha didn't work so much at her friendship with Sophie. She is the one that usually PUTS their friendship in trouble of disappearing :/ I mean, you probably like Agatha because she is a great example of someone who is underestimated. That until the second book. She probably is the princess of the story and has Tedros as her prince, but she actually hadn't done ANYTHING to reach this place. She had everything right in front of her nose. Professor Dovey which kept throwing her up, Professor Anemone which really believes in her and other professors in general. All she had to do is belive. She didn't even have to WIN Tedros' love. She had everything set in front of her by the Storian leaving her only to act the role. The only part where she really worked something out and where she truly chose to herself was when she chose Sophie in the first book over Tedros. And EVEN THAT couldn't work for her. She HAD to PUT THAT WISH. The princess returns, people :/. And then Sophie is left out. Well, Sophie HAD TO WIN Tedros' love and WORK in their story. Do I even have to mention that whenever Sophie, the only character in this book who really tried to do something of her own in that story, the one who didn't have a PATH LAYED OUT FOR HER, A CHOICE is considered a bad character, and nothing works out for her? Don't remind me. She built her own path that couldn't be bright because everything was stolen for Agatha. Everything good. And Agatha hadn't done A SINGLE THING for their friendship. In the first book, as I said, she chose her. OK. But in the second she dumps her. She nearly KILLES her. What friendship is that if the princess wants to kill the witch? If Sophie tries to kill Agatha I understand. She's Evil. But not our ""perfect"" Agatha.In this whole book Agatha was more like :I don't care about my friendship. I DON'T CARE SHE WANTED TO SAVE SOPHIE BECAUSE THAT'S A LIE. HER ONLY THING IN MIND WAS TEDROS. And Sophie? Sophie who invested a lot in their friendship? Sophie who worked for both? Sophie who always thought about losing her?That's why everyone's happy and togheter. Sophie doesn't have someone all to herself like Agatha has Tedros. So everyone is on the move, happy, somehow, if I can say that, and togheter. Everyone.Exept Sophie.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36203664-a-crystal-of-time,A Crystal of Time.txt
Imagine Me,"”What happened to you, man?” I whisper. “Where’d you go?”“Hell,” he says. “I’ve finally found hell.”Me too, Ladies and Gentlemen, me too! >_<Hell was reading this book and you better get yourself some chocolate before you continue to read because I’m so bitter that I could be mistaken for a lemon. I’m not just bitter though, I’m salty as well. So buckle up this is going to be a spicy ride. (Okay, I’m done with the food hints now. *lol* You get the idea! ;-P)This book was just ... URGH!!I’m so disappointed right now I’ve been fighting to find the proper words for at least two weeks. And I just realized that I’ll probably never find them. >_< I think the most important thing you have to know is that I loved the original trilogy! It was so good and I’m such a huge Tahereh Mafi fan! Moreover I actually enjoyed books 4 and 5! They were different but they were still good! So what went wrong? A LOT!!! Or basically everything!Seriously, if it wouldn’t have been for my belovedJellowho had thequestionablepleasure to experience my disappointment first hand I most certainly would have never made it through this book! So a huge shout-out to Jello for surviving this buddy read with me! *lol* You’re the best, girl! And I swear I would have never made it through this book without your support! <333 So thank you so much for keeping me company on this hard ride. XD It was tough for both of us but we got through it somehow! *sighs* This said let’s get to the root of the problem:”My questions are endless.I kill them.”Oh, how I wish I would have had the same luxury!!!Unlike Juliette I couldn’t just kill my questions though and instead of getting answers all I got was a headache and even more questions than before. There happened so many things that left question marks above my head and NONE, really NONE were answered! You’d think an author who writes the last book in a series that consists of 6!!! (SIX!!!) books in total would try to wrap it up all nicely in the end? Nope! Nah, Nuh-uh. Nopedy nope! I didn’t get my awesome ending wrapped up in a lovely bow and I’m so bitter about it! So, so bitter! And this comes from a fan that loved and read all the former books, mind you! I’m not writing this rant because I dislike Tahereh’s books or because I want to make her feel bad, I’m writing this rant because ILOVETahereh and her writing style and I can’t believe that she would write such an ending!!! I just can’t wrap my head around it!”It is only in the desperate seconds before death that we realize the windows against which we broke our bodies were only mirrors, all along.”What went wrong Tahereh? Why give us such a sloppy ending even though we know you are a magnificent writer?! Where did your amazing and beautiful writing style go? I missed it during the entire book. The fact that I only wrote down 4 quotes from a book that consists of 450 pages should already tell us enough! After reading all the other books I couldn’t even pack all those lovely and beautiful quotes into my reviews. I had no problem this time around. In fact I had to go looking for those 4 quotes so that I actually COULD put something into this review. *shakes head*Still, the writing style wasn’t the only thing that made me sad. I also missed the amazingness of my beloved characters. They used to be complex, they had character arcs and they developed. They grew and changed over time. In this book it was like they all went back to their starting point and couldn’t be more than stereotypes. Which is such a shame! And don’t even get me started on Juliette/Ella!WTH, Tahereh?!!! I hated Robo-J so much and whenever I read “Yes, sir!” I felt like I wanted to puke!! What was the point in making her bland like that? That entire thing with Anderson and his sadistic streak, the fact that Juliette was attracted to HIM??!! WHAT DID I EVEN READ HERE?? At times it felt like I jumped right into a twisted and revolting version of “50 Shades of Grey” and the obedient/dull soldier looking up to her dominant master theme was THE WORST and so didn’t work for me!!!Another thing that riled me big time was that the main topic of those last 3 books was Emmaline and then we barely get anything about her. The first 10% of the book and then... nothing! Like she wasn’t important enough to keep the plot moving. Instead we get... moments that made me want to tear my hair out! >_< And to add insult to injury we get an epilogue that was so unsatisfying that I sat there crying into the book! Not because it was so good, but because it made my heart bleed all over the pages by not being what I wanted it to be. T_TThis book should have been named “Torture Me” instead of “Imagine Me” but if I have to go with the theme, I’ll do it my way (and this is where it gets salty, my friends):“Imagine Me” borrowing Winston's whiskey flask and taking a big swig in order to get through this book. *lol* Thank you, Winston! ;-P“Imagine Me” throwing this book against a wall.“Imagine Me” setting it on fire and then chucking it out of the window.And “Imagine Me” letting it being run over by a car only to get drenched in rain! All for good measure, of course! ;-)“Imagine Me” hoping for a great ending and getting THIS and...A DOG!!! Not even a wedding but a freaking dog??! I understand why Tahereh wrote that scene but I really would have rather wanted to read their wedding scene! Damn it!“Imagine Me” and my face falling when I realized this was neither about Emmaline nor about my OTP.I mean Juliette and Warner’s relationship was basically non-existent! They spent about 90% of this book apart and then he KISSES her back into her mind??!! Like seriously? Are you kidding me? Juliette doesn’t even recognize, let alone remember Warner, but she makes out with him? How could Tahereh reduce their beautiful and deep relationship to nothing but physical attraction? There was so much more than that between them and it was the physical aspect she latched on to?!! WE (the fans) and Warner & Juliette deserved so much better than that!!!“Imagine Me” being one of Tahereh’s biggest fans but being so damn salty I could turn a lake into the sea. If you ever come across an Austrian lake that’s as salty as the Black Sea: I’m sorry, that was me! XD“Imagine Me” getting whiplash from shaking my head too much! My neck hurts, no kidding!“Imagine Me” losing my appetite every single time Juliette said “Yes, sir!” (I need to eat lots of Christmas cookies to compensate for that!!)“Imagine Me” wanting to erase the memory of this book with bleach! Yes, I’m that desperate! Come to think of it Evie and Max would come in pretty handy right now.“Imagine Me” collapsing under the weight of all those question marks, because let’s face it: This book was all over the place! I feel like Atlas and it’s no fun!And last but not least: “Imagine Me” renaming this book “Torture Me”!The only good thing about “Torture Me” was Warner’s and Kenji’s bromance! Well, and this quote:”To the world, she is formidable.To me?She is the world.”That’s it!My fan heart is so broken right now, I want to “imagine” a world with a better ending than this! T_TOkay, I’m done with the puns and I’ve vomited all my bitterness into this review.I’m sorry to say it but I can’t give this more than 2,5 stars rounded up to 3. (I really wish we’d have half-stars here because 2,5 would be way more accurate than 3.) 2,5 stars because otherwise it would feel like I’d let Tahereh get away with this disaster of a book and someone has to speak the truth. As a huge fan of this series my heart is bleeding but I stand by my opinion! #SorryNotSorryLet’s hope Mafi’s next book will be better again!_______________________________Buddy read with my one and onlyJ.!(Should I call you “Jello” now? *lol* 😜)I’m not gonna lie: I’m kinda scared about what will happen in this one, but as long as I’m reading“Imagine Me”with you I shall be fine! ;-)Let’s fight through this!Together we cansurvivemake it.I mean, how bad can it be?! *they said right before the shit hit the fan* XD______________________________OMG!!Wait!What?!When did this become a thing, how come I didn't know about this?Since when is there a cover?GAHHHHHH!*has a mental breakdown*Okay,I'm fine now.THIS.COVER.THOUGH!!!*whimpers*",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44054122-imagine-me,Imagine Me.txt
Defy Me,"“Whatever, bro. No judgment. The world’s on fire. Have some fun.”I think that sentence indicates the overall mood of this book, because wow, the world truly is on fire. *lol* Joking aside I’ve to admit that my feelings about“Defy Me”are pretty mixed. On the one hand this was totally not what I expected it to be, but on the other hand it was still good somehow?! I don’t know how to explain this but I was kind of disappointed by how it all turned out, yet at the same time I was going with the flow and enjoyed many scenes and parts of the book.“Shatter Me” is one of the first series I binged and loved and there’s always this sort of nostalgia when I read another of Mafi’s books. I just love Warner, I adore Kenji and I like Juliette (or Ella) and therefore I’ll always be happy to read more about them. The longer this series continues the more it gets unrealistic and crazy though. And this is me, one of the series biggest fans, speaking their mind. So while I’m all like: Gimmi more!!! I also feel like this series has been going on for too long and that it probably would have been best to stop after book 3. Urgh! I hate myself for even thinking this, but it is the way it is and you all know you’ll always get unapologetic honesty from me. ;-)So did I enjoy “Defy Me”? Yes and no! Yes, because as I already said I got a lot of my favourite characters and no, because the plot kind of lacked depth? I mean sure, there were quite a lot of revelations but when it comes to the pace it was really slow and there actually didn’t happen a lot. So whilst I enjoy character driven books I still would have liked for the plot to have a little bit more substance. Urgh, look at me trying to find the right words. *lol* Anyway, I still enjoyed it and even though I’m worried about the last book I’ll still read it, because I really hope that Mafi will be able to tie everything up with a nice bow. XDThis said, let’s talk about the characters! And believe me, there’s a lot to talk about! ;-PThe characters:And here comes another warning: My characters section is full of spoilers and to read through it might kill some of your enjoyment when you actually read the book. This said: Pirates ye be warned! ;-P Proceed at your own risk!Ella (aka Juliette):”I had no idea how much we’d lost, no idea how much of him I’d longed for. I had no idea how desperately we’d been fighting. How many years we’d fought for moments – minutes – to be together.”Now the Juliette – or Ella – in this book was exactly my kind of girl! After reading “Restore Me” I wasn’t happy with the direction in which her character developed, but I’ve to say that I really like that new Ella. XD Maybe it were all those memories that made her stronger or the fact that her biological parents are horrible. No matter what it was, it was really good to see her take control of her life again! That’s what I missed in the other book! Our strong and independent girl that makes decisions and acts on them, throwing all caution into the wind! *lol* Okay, she didn’t throw ALL caution into the wind but she certainly acted more like herself in this one. Then again I suppose to have your memories constantly erased and to be filled with new and torturous memories whenever you’re set back will take a toll on anyone. I mean WTF?! I hate her parents for what they did to her, Emmaline and Warner. And I’m really glad Ella ended Evie. Or did she? Maybe she can heal herself too?! I guess we’ll find out in the last book. For now all I say is: Welcome back, Ella! It’s a pleasure to see you again! ;-)Warner:”A profound, painful ache has rooted inside of me, carrying with it the weight of years. Being apart from Juliette –Ella – has always been hard, but now it seems unsurvivable.I’m being slowly decimated by emotion.”My sweet, sweet boy and awesomeness on two legs!!! Ahhh he already suffered so much and once again my heart broke for him! <3 I hate and despise his father so damn much! If he’d spent eternity in hell it still wouldn’t be enough! Still, can I say that I FREAKING LOVED Warner in here?!! I saw so many new sides of his character and I adore them all!!! XD I mean he’s still a tortured soul but behind that perfect and ruined facade of his, he’s actually a funny, strong and sassy boy! I mean Warner getting annoyed because his attempt to kill his father was thwarted was priceless!!! An insult to his skill set!? *LOL* Also: Four books in this series!!! FOUR FREAKING BOOKS and I can’t remember ever hearing Warner curse! Haha! And so typical for him he even bothers to explain it with his special brand of sophisticated dignity and poise! *LOL* So yes, my boy might be tortured and broken but he’s mending and I absolutely love the person he’s becoming. I really thought I couldn’t love him any more than I already do but as it seems Mafi is proving me wrong. <3 I loved the ending so much because Warner was so happy, which is the reason I’m so damn afraid of the next book. I’m sure it will all go to hell and I just can’t take it. >_< Let Warner be happy, please?!”Shit.”“Did you just swear?” Nazeera says, stunned.“I’m in an extraordinary amount of pain.”“No one warned me about the nightmares, the panic attacks, or the dark destructive thoughts that would follow. No one explained to me how darkness works, how it feasts on itself or how it festers. I hardly recognize myself these days. Becoming an instrument of torture destroyed what was left of my mind.Kenji:”I turn, stare at the wall. I can’t be distracted by her anymore. She knows I’m into her – my infatuation is apparently obvious to everyone within a ten-mile radius, according to Castle – and she’s clearly been using my idiocy to her best advantage.Smart. I respect the tactic.”I know a lot of people think that Kenji turned into a completely different person because he’s become more serious and has a lot of depressing thoughts, but what those people don’t keep in mind is that this is only due to the fact that we never got his POV. We only saw Kenji from the outside and the way the characters around him perceive him. Yes, on the outside he’s all smiles and fun but on the inside he’s a very deep character and feels so many different emotions that it’s really painful to see them revealed. In short: He’s human! You can’t always be happy and the part he’s showing the people around him is not how he feels inside. I mean I’m pretty sure about 90% of my friends on here would say I’m a funny and cheerful person, but that doesn’t mean that I’m always like that. I do have my dark days too and it’s the same with Kenji. So yes, he’s different but only because we finally get to see his private feelings, thoughts and fears. ;-) I still love Kenji and I think I love him even more now because I can understand him better. XD”But right now I’m out of gas. I’m out of James’s jokes. I’m fresh out of fake smiles. Right now I’m nothing but pain and exhaustion and raw emotion, and I don’t have the bandwidth for another serious conversation. I really don’t want to do this right now.”Nazeera:”None of us got to choose this life. None of us enjoyed being taught to torture before we could even drive. And it’s not insane to imagine that sometimes even horrible people are searching for a way out of their own darkness.”Nazeera is still some sort of wildcard for me. Yes, we got a little bit more info about her motivations and affiliation but the overall picture of her character is still very blurry. I don’t know why she’s helping them and I want a better reason than the one we were given. Am I really supposed to believe that she only helps them because she sees the errors of the supreme commander’s ways? True, they did a lot of bad things, mostly to Emmaline, Ella and Warner, and okay, she apparently was Emmaline’s best friend, but there’s got to be more to her story! Something must have happened that caused her to join Castle’s camp and I really want to know what! I really hope there’ll be an answer in the last book!Evie & Max:”Perhaps it’s impossible for you to understand how I’m feeling right now. Perhaps you don’t care to know the depth of my disappointments. But you and Emmaline are my life’s work.”I think Evie and Max should go and ... you know what I’m about to say, right?! *lol* But seriously, those two are such horrible human beings that I’m actually starting to doubt if they are even human. I mean WTF??!! How could they do that to their own daughters?! I hate them so much and I just want them to burn in hell! Poor Emmaline! The way she lives now... it’s no life at all. It’s torture and Evie and Max are to blame! I really hope Evie is truly dead now but after Anderson came back again I kind of doubt that we really saw the last of her. For Emmaline’s sake I hope that she is but I’m sure Mafi still has something in store for us. >_<The relationships & ships:Ella & Warner:I have to step away from her. “I don’t – “I look at her again. “Are you sure I don’t know you?”And she smiles. Smiles at me and my heart shatters.“Trust me,” she says. “I’d remember you.”YESH!!! MY OTP IS BACK IN THE GAME!!!!! <333 GJAHAHHAHAHAHAH! I’m so happy they are together again and managed to talk it out! I mean they sort of didn’t have to talk it out all too much because Ella’s memories put everything into perspective but they still spoke about their breakup which is good! XD I loved the quote above because it connects us right with the first book and this was done really masterfully! ;-) If there is one thing I didn’t like about “Defy Me”, then it was the fact that it took them so damn long to get together again! I mean they basically only reunite at the end of the book and I really would have liked to have more quiet and tender Ella and Warner moments. There can never be enough happy moments for them. XD Also the plot existed only of them finding together and a few revelations which was kind of minimalistic, but then again I got the impression that this was what you’d call “a filler book” before the finale begins so I suppose now that all the chess figures are in place we’ll get quite the action in the last book. Or at least I hope we do. ;-P Anyway, I kinda dig the idea of them marrying even though I think they are too young. After everything they’ve been through it’s no surprise though. Mhmmm let’s see what Mafi will do with this plot device in “Imagine Me”. *lol*”Her face is pressed against my neck. She’s clinging to me like she might never let go and it does something to me, something heady, to know that she could possibly want me – or need me – like this. It makes me want to protect her even if she doesn’t need protecting. It makes me want to carry her away. Lose track of time.”Ella & Kenji:”Can we cry about it later? I’ll tell you everything.”“Hell yeah we can cry about it later.” Kenji tugs gently on my hand to get us moving again. “I have so much shit to cry about, J. So much. We should make, like, a list.”Aww their friendship is still everything! <333 I love how open and honest they are with each other. They don’t beat about the bush but address things directly and even though we didn’t get a lot of their friendship in this one it’s still amazing. I hope to see more of their interactions in the next instalment and I swear Kenji definitely needs Ella’s advice! *lol* How else is he supposed to handle Nazeera! That boy is totally out of his depth! Haha! Also Kenji admitting that Ella’s situation is breaking his heart. Ahhhh!! He cares about her so much that it hurts him to see her sad and in pain. That’s #friendshipgoals right there! <333Kenji & Warner:Kenji flips us both off.Aaron laughs. And then, leaning in –“You really think I look good in everything?”“Shut up, asshole.”Aaron laughs again.I still kind of SHIP THEM?! *LOL* I just can’t help but be in awe of Kenji being able to actually make Warner laugh!!! And the fact that Kenji thinks he looks good in everything?! Just too damn precious!! Like it’s really obvious that Kenji sorta digs him. XD Apparently Warner likes him too! Since we all know that Ella & Warner are the endgame and our OTP I’ll just accept their bromance and settle for being happy with it though! ;-PNazeera & Kenji:”Can’t look at you.”She hesitates. “Why not?”“Too pretty.”She laughs, but angrily, like she might punch me in the face. “Kenji, I’m trying to be serious with you.”I loved tired Kenji!! *lol* That boy can’t think clearly when he’s tired and the things he admitted and said to Nazeera!? Adorable, just freaking adorable! <3 I swear if she doesn’t give him a decent chance and toys with him I’ll personally scratch her eyes out! XD Kenji deserves a really nice girl that understands him and takes care of him. That appreciates him for who he is! So you better be that girl Nazeera! Also it was really nice to finally get a sexy scene with Kenji. I always knew that he can be sweet and sexy so I was glad we eventually got to experience that side of him. And yes, Nazeera and my boy DO have chemistry. I just hope she’ll show her true colours in the last book. =)Anderson & Warner:”He knew, when he made that deal, what he was asking me to do. I didn’t. I was sixteen, still young enough to believe in hope, and he took advantage of my naiveté. He knew what it would do to me. He knew it would break me. And it was all he’d ever wanted.My soul.”And I still DESPISE and HATE Anderson! Why isn’t that scumbag of a father dead already? Damn Evie and Max and all their stupid experiments. If they wouldn’t have helped him, Anderson would be where he belongs. Six feet under! And good riddance! Why can’t that man finally die?! My boy needs to be free of him in order to move on and as long as he is around that won’t happen. So can Mafi finally put an end to Anderson’s despicable reign? I think Warner suffered enough and I think he deserves a life, NO A WORLD, without his father in it. Can we get it real soon, please?!Conclusion:Just like after reading “Restore Me” I don’t know how to feel about this book. This time around my emotions at the end of“Defy Me”weren’t as intense as they were after reading its predecessor but I think that’s mostly due to the nature of the ending. And even though in here it all tied up nicely for a change I still have quite a lot of mixed feelings about it all. Plus, I can’t help but feel like this ending is just the calm before the storm. I know it! I know that all hell is going to break loose as soon as I open “Imagine Me” and I’m so scared of reading what will happen. >_< Let’s just hope this is going to be an ending I can live with.

Restore Me,"By now a few days have passed ever since I finished reading this book, yet my first reaction to“Restore Me”still remains the same.WHAT THE FREAKING HELL??!!WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK??!!WHAT DID I JUST READ??!!CAN ANYONE TELL ME WHAT I JUST READ?!!And those were only four of the nicer things I thought when I closed the last page of this mind-blowing book! After reading this I’m shook to the core and my feelings are still all over the place! Tahereh MafiSHATTERED, UNRAVELLED and DESTROYEDme with every single line. To read this felt like someone was constantly punching me, hurting my body and my soul!!Oh god, all those revelations! I can’t even... I’m still thinking about everything that happened in this book, I’m trying to wrap my head around it, I’m trying to understand it, but I just can’t.This was just too much!!! My brain suffers from an overload of thoughts and feels and I’m desperately trying to recover from all the different blows. They came from every direction and boy did it hurt!! *cries*TAHEREH HOW DARE YOU TO WRITE SUCH A BOOK AND THEN LET US WAIT FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR?!!!??I wish I would have never bought this…I wish I would have never read this…I wish I wouldn’t have to wait for the next book…This is pure torture…“Restore Me”??!! *shakes head*Are you kidding me Tahereh? You should have named it “Ruin Me”, “Devastate Me” or “Destruct Me”!Not “Restore Me” why did you name this book like that?!!!I can’t … I just can’t anymore… *sobs violently*The plot:Juliette Ferrars is the new Supreme Commander of America and struggling to maintain a tight grip on her newfound powers and responsibility. There are a lot of things she hasn’t figured out yet and as the days go by she’s trying her best to take one step after the other forcing herself not to crumble under the sheer force of the new role that has been bestowed upon her. Will she be able to deal with the consequences of her actions or will her past cause her to falter?!The characters:I’m so going to spoil the hell out of this section because FEELS!!! I can’t keep them in and if you don’t want to be captured in the midst of my raging emotions you better don’t continue to read! You’ve been warned! This is going to be a spoiler FEAST!!!Juliette:”I’m not proud that I’ve thought that.Or that, in the quietest, loneliest hours of the morning I lie awake next to the son Anderson tortured nearly to death and wish that Anderson would return from the dead and take back the burden I stole from his shoulders.”Where did the brave Juliette from “Ignite Me” go? I mean yeah, I knew she wouldn’t change overnight and that all her actions of the first three books would have some serious consequences, for some reason I really hoped that by now she would have developed more self-confidence though. I mean I get it! There’s a lot of responsibility on her shoulders and all those revelations were hitting her relentlessly, but despite all that some part of me still expected her to be stronger. She’s so powerful, why should she ever be afraid?! Plus even a blind person could see that Warner loves her more than anything else! How can she be so oblivious?! And that moment when she got drunk and shaved her head? This was such a 2007 Britney Spears move. I can understand why she was angry at Warner, I don’t get why she had to push him away so thoroughly though. It’s not like he knew the entire truth. I don’t like what happened to my independent and kick-ass Juliette from “Ignite Me” and I really hope that she’ll regain some of her self-assurance in the next book. Plus can we please talk about the fact that she killed an entire room full of people?! With nothing more than a scream?!! WTF?!!! O_o There’s a lot of explaining to do!!”She steps forward. She looks suddenly terrifying. There’s a fire in her eyes. A murderous stillness in her movements. “If I ever catch you putting your hands on him again, I will tear open your chest,” she says, “and rip out your heart.””Getting angry and going to war, I understand. But patiently playing a confusing game of chess with a bunch of stranger from around the world?God, I’d so much rather shoot someone.””Right now I can see her, this other version of myself, I can see her dragging her dirty fingernails against the chambers of my heart, drawing blood. And if I could reach inside myself and rip her out of me with my own two hands, I would.””I’m trying to come to terms with the fact that nothing is going to be the same for me, not ever again, and I have no idea who to trust or how to move forward. So yeah,” I say, nearly shouting the words, “right now I don’t care about anything. Because I don’t know what I’m fighting for anymore. And I don’t know who my friends are. Right now,” I say, “everyone is my enemy, including you.”Warner:”I feel old and unsettled, my heart and mind at war.”My precious boy, my awesomeness on two legs!! Gosh, I love him so much!!! <333 He’s still my no.1 book husband (with Will of course!!!) and I couldn’t get enough of him! I loved that he had his own POV but his thoughts were so damn sad. I just wanted to hug him and tell him that he’s awesome and important and that he has a freaking damn right to grief!!!! Yes, I know everyone hated his father and Warner was certainly no exception to that rule, but this awful tyrant was still his father! No matter how much he hurt him and tortured him, no matter what he did to him, he was still his father and such bonds are hard to break. I hated that he was so alone in his grief and that no one except of Adam seemed to see and to understand it. Adam of all people! And Juliette! Girl, give that boy a break!!! I mean how much time passed after “Ignite Me”? Two weeks? How was Warner supposed to teach her everything he knew in two weeks? I mean it took him his entire life to master and understand the Reestablishment. And he didn’t even know the entire truth!!! He just wanted to protect Juliette, why is that so wrong?! My poor, poor baby!!! Warner didn’t deserve any of the shit he got in this book and I really hope Tahereh isn’t going to hurt him even more!! And what’s with that last Warner chapter?! An empty journal?!! AN EMPTY JOURNAL, TAHEREH???!!! If you put Warner into an asylum cell I’m going to RIOT!!! I’ll freaking riot!!! If he’s even more tortured and abused I’m going to die!!! Really!!! So you better don’t do anything mean to him!! AN EMPTY JOURNAL!!! *has a mental breakdown*”And it is this, my unrequited affection for my father, that has always been my greatest weakness. So I lie here, marinating in a sorrow I can never speak of, while regret consumes my heart.””I have a great fear of drowning in the ocean of my own silence. In the steady thrum that accompanies quiet, my mind is unkind to me. I think too much. I feel, perhaps, far more than I should. It would be only a slight exaggeration to say that my goal in life is to outrun my mind, my memories.So I have to keep moving.”“I’m strangled into speechlessness, numb in my bones. I feel nothing but an immense, impossible pressure breaking apart my body. I fall backward, hard. My head is against the wall. I try to calm myself, calm my breathing. I try to be rational.””I’ve been undone by emotion, over and over. It was emotion that prompted me to take any job – at any cost – to be near to my mother. It was emotion that led me to find Juliette, to seek her out in search of a cure for my mother. It was emotion that prompted me to fall in love, to get shot and lose my mind, to become a broken boy all over again – one who’d fall to his knees and beg his worthless, monstrous father to spare the girl he loved. It was emotion, my flimsy emotions that cost me everything.I have no peace. No purpose.How I wish I’d ripped out this heart from my chest long ago.”Kenji:”I mean, I know she’s probably a sociopath. And, like, would definitely murder me in my sleep. But damn she’s, wow,” he says. “She’s, like, batshit pretty. The kind of pretty that makes a man think getting murdered in his sleep might not be a bad way to go.”I still love and adore Kenji!!! He’s such an awesome best friend and he always brings some fun into the book. I swear if it wouldn’t have been for Kenji this entire book would have been a brooding feast, so thank you Tahereh for inventing that boy!!! *lol* The only thing I’m still missing is a Kenji POV so maybe we’ll finally get that in the next book? XD Ohh, I’d dig a Kenji POV so much!!! Haha! And since my wishes for a girlfriend/love interest were obviously heard the last time this wish might come true as well, right? XD *making huge puppy eyes*Nazeera & Haider:I still don’t know what to think about those two. Apparently Nazeera was a close friend of Juliette when they were kids and Haider seems to like Warner a lot, so I’m pretty certain there’ll be a lot of interesting revelations in the next book. Despite the general air of hostility I liked both of their characters though. I mean Nazeera is a strong female character and I always dig them and Haider … Well we didn’t get to see a lot of him but I wouldn’t be surprised if he had some abilities too. ;-P Plus Nazeera and Kenji!!! GOSH! That would be a match made in heaven!!! <333Castle:WHO. ARE. YOU?!This Castle was so completely different to the Castle we got to know in the earlier books! Where did all this information come from? How did he know about all the things not even Warner knew about?! Why did he know that Juliette’s parents are still alive? Does he work for them? Is he related to Juliette?! Where is the connection? I don’t get anything anymore. Up until now Castle was always some sort of gentle guide who gave good advice but took a back seat when things got too intense. Not now! Now he was smack in the middle and seemed to know more than anyone else! I have so many questions my head is spinning!!! And I demand answers in the next book!!! I want to know who he is!!!Adam:”I was an asshole. I took everything out on her. Blamed her for everything. For walking away from what I thought was one of the few sure things in my life. It’s my own fault, really. My own baggage. I’ve still got a lot of shit to work out,” he says finally. “I’ve got issues with people leaving me behind.”THIS!!!It took 3 books to finally get this statement out of his mouth but it eventually happened!!!! OMG!!! I never thought I’d live to see the day when Kent admits that he was wrong!!! Ohh that was balm for my soul! XD Thank you Tahereh! I needed to read this so badly! If you think I’ll forgive Kent for everything he did you’re wrong though. I’ll tolerate him from now on, but the things he said to Juliette and Warner… Nope he’ll never be redeemed for that! Sorry! #SorryNotSorryThe friendships & ships:Juliette & Kenji:I slap his hand away. “I may not know much about being a supreme commander yet, but I do know that I’m not supposed to be cute.”Just then, the elevator dings open.“Who says you can’t be cute and kick ass at the same time?” Kenji winks at me. “I do it every day.”I still love their friendship! They are so adorable together and they act like siblings would do! *lol* I love that Kenji always tries to help Juliette and that deep down he’s more than just a little protective of her. Not that he’d show it, but it’s obvious whenever they interact with each other. XD Plus I’m glad that there’s at least one person Juliette can trust completely. Kenji would never lie to her and that’s good the way it is! =))Warner & Kenji:I smile, big. Lightbulb bright.Kenji’s eyes widen, surprised, and he laughs. He nods at my face and says, “Aw, you’ve got dimples. I didn’t know that. That’s cute.”I. SHIP. IT!!!Haha! I know Tahereh might have never intended her fans to ship Kenji and Warner but how couldn’t you?! *lol* Once they actually started to talk and stopped to be so hostile towards each other they were damn freaking cute! XD I loved their honest conversations and it made me happy that Kenji was able to make Warner smile! I mean he made him smile!!! That’s such an accomplishment! *lol* So yeah, I totally dig them! Sorry Tahereh! I can’t help it! ;-P”I don’t really know man,” Kenji says, and sighs. “I think, this time, you just have to deal with the consequences of your own stupidity.”I look away, bite back a laugh, and nod several times as I say, “Go to hell, Kishimoto.”“I’m right behind you, bro.” He winks at me. Just once. And disappears.Juliette & Warner:”I miss you,” she says. It’s a whisper I almost don’t catch.“I’m right here,” I say, gently touching her cheek. “I’m right here, love.”But she shakes her head. Even as I pull her closer, even as she falls back asleep, she shakes her head.MY SHIP HAS SUNK!!! *sobs* WHY TAHEREH??!!! Why did you have to do this? This was so damn painful to read!! I mean I understand that both of them had a lot of baggage and that they couldn’t change the way they are, but this?! WHY? So much heartbreak and pain on both of their sides!!! I just wanted them to be happy, to overcome their pain together, but nothing of that happened. Instead they drifted apart and didn’t talk to each other!! What happened to their mutual, strong, respectful and understanding relationship?! I can’t even put into words how much this killed me! You better set this right in the next book! They are my OTP!!! They need to be happy together!!! AND WHAT THE FREAKING HELL WAS THIS LAST CHAPTER?!!! Are you telling me that Warner and Juliette already loved each other when they were children?! That they played together and liked each other?!!! OMG!!! This ending really messed with my mind! I NEED BOOK 5! NOW!!! *faints*”You will be made to feel lonely. Lost. You will long for validation from those you once admired, agonizing between pleasing old friends and doing what is right.” I look up. I feel my heart swell with pride as I stare at her. “But you must never, ever let the idiots into your head. They will only lead you astray.””Haider looks Juliette up and down then, examining her outfit, her hair, her plain, worn tennis shoes; and though he says nothing, I can feel his disapproval, his scepticism and ultimately – his disappointment in her.It makes me want to throw him in the ocean.””Love.It hits me with a painful force, the reminder. Of just how much I love her. God, I love all of her. Her impossibilities, her exasperations. I love how gentle she is with me when we’re alone. How soft and kind she can be in our quiet moments. How she never hesitates to defend me.I love her.””This, I think, is the way to die.I could drown in this moment and I’d never regret it. I could catch fire from this kiss and happily turn to ash. I could live here, die here, right here, against his hips, his lips. In the emotion in his eyes as he sinks into me, his heartbeats indistinguishable from mine.This. Forever. This.“”It’s a picture of a little boy standing next to a little girl. She’s sitting in a stairwell. He looks at her as she eats a piece of cake.I flip it over.Aaron and Ella""All told, there was a lot about“Restore Me”that I loved, but also so much I hated. I’m really conflicted now and I don’t know if I loved or if I hated the book. After reading the ending I had to supress the sudden urge to throw it against a wall, but I also wanted to cradle it and cry my heart out. Ahhh I just don’t know how to feel about his book. I’m drowning in my emotions here. >_<All I know is that I’m devastated and that I want to read“Shatter Me 5”asap! Shatter Me 5… there isn’t even a title yet. URGH!!! *dies*",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34992929-restore-me,Restore Me.txt
A Court of Frost and Starlight,"”Mother above and Cauldron save me.”Yep, that’s exactly what I thought when I read another one of Feyre and Rhy’s naughty scenes! The words might have been the same; my thoughts came with an eye roll instead of pleasure though. As did a lot of other things while I read this novella. Don’t get me wrong, I still enjoyed almost every second of this and it was really nice to spend some time with all those characters again BUT (yes, it’s a big but) there were a lot of things that didn’t sit well with me and you can bet your lovely behind on the fact that I’m going to point them out later on when I get to the spoilery parts of this review.Generally speaking this wasn’t bad. We got to see a little bit of our characters normal lives and I think we can all agree that after everything they went through they deserve some normalcy and happiness. It was nice to walk through Velaris, to go Solstice shopping with Mor and Feyre and to see those beloved characters interact with each other. They all survived the war and each and every single one of them is trying to cope with the aftermath. There are plenty of wounds that still need to heal and I’m kind of grateful Sarah decided to give her characters some room to come to terms with everything. So yes, this novella might not have a huge plot but definitely provides a good transition into the next series. ;-)Still, there were quite a lot of interesting dialogues and a bunch of things that either made me happy or caused me to get angry. Mostly it was the relationships between the characters and so this is exactly what I’m going to write about. Buckle up! This is going to be a hard ride! *lol*From here on out, I’ll talk about the relationships and ships of the characters, so this isn’t only going to be rant and gush feast but also a spoiler celebration! If you still continue to read and haven’t read ACOFAS yet, it’s at your own risk! Don’t say I didn’t warn you! ;-)The relationships & ships:Feyre & Rhys:”But you are bothering – you’re both still working to make this peace last. Peace, Rhys. We have peace, and the true kind. Enjoy it – enjoy each other. You paid the debt before it was ever a debt.”I totally agree with Cassian and even though this might sound harsh now I still need to say it: I want them to enjoy each other too, but please not as the MCs of the following books. I love Feyre and Rhys, I really do, but I think from ACOWAR on out their character development was kind of detrimental. I already mentioned it in my review of ACOWAR and I’ll say it again Feyre’s and Rhys’s holier-than-thou attitude is beginning to get on my nerves. Feyre and her friends weren’t the only ones that suffered and it would be really nice if she’d get out of her pink bubble and would acknowledge the fact that others hurt too! It’s good that Rhys and her have each other but not everyone is as lucky as them and it would help to remember that they made mistakes too! Also if I read about “toes that curl” in Feyre’s boots one more time I’m going to be sick. Yes, we got it, Rhys is such a sexy male and they really love each other. If you ask me their story should have ended after ACOWAR because right now I have more negative feelings towards them than positive ones and this is actually kinda sad. >_< Okay, Feysand shippers are allowed to take out their pitchforks and torches now... Just give me a little head start, will you? ;-PFeyre & Lucien:”And what, exactly, does this Band of Exiles plan to do? Host events? Organize party-planning committees?”Lucien’s metal eye clicked faintly and narrowed. “You can be as much of an asshole as that mate of yours, you know that?”I think Feyre was a real bitch to Lucien in this book. And no, I’m not sorry for saying it out loud. After all someone has to do it and I don’t mind it being me. I mean if she really wants him to be friends with her, she has to accept that he has his own life and doesn’t want to depend on her and Rhys. If she’d be honest to herself she’d realize that Lucien isn’t welcome at her court and that he has his reasons to stay away from them. I think the only two people who feel real sympathy for Lucien are Az and Amren and they only do it to some extent. So yeah, she can’t expect him to be happy with the situation. Lucien lost so much over the centuries and now he even lost Tam and his second home. It’s not Feyre’s call to decide what’s best for him! Especially because she’s actually the reason why Lucien isn’t welcome at Tam’s place anymore. So nope, take care of your own court and leave Lucien be! Thank you very much! And a huge YAY for Lucien! Because he dared to call Feyre and Ryhs out on their bullsh*t and didn’t back down! That’s my man!!! <333 Also I totally agree with him! Rhys shouldn’t have said what he did and the way he treated Tam cost him a lot of my sympathy.”Your mate should have known better than to kick a downed male.””I can’t stand to be in the same room as her for more than two minutes. I can’t stand to be in this court and have your mate pay for the very clothes on my back.”Elain & Lucien:”He hadn’t mentioned Elain, or his proximity to her. Elaine had not asked him to stay, or to go. And whether she cared about the bruises on his face, she certainly hadn’t let on.”So if you already put away your pitchforks and torches, guess now is the right time to draw them out again, because this isn’t going to be nice and tell you what: I actually don’t care! I’ll say it as it is: I HATE Elain! There, I said it! And I’m not even sorry for it! You think Nesta is a witch? Oh well, guess Elain is even worse because she hides it behind her super sweet appearance and gentle actions. By now I’ve reached a point where I despise her and I’m sick and tired of everyone defending this woman just because she is so sweet! Where was Elain when Feyre was taken by Tam? What did Elain do when Feyre went out hunting for them? Nesta might be a witch, and I can’t even believe I’m saying this, but at least she went looking for Feyre. What did Elain do? She got engaged to Grayson! YAY! Way to go! Also everyone loving precious and dear Elain! WTF?!!! Did Elain ever do anything except of looking lovely?! (Yes, she might be a great cook and good at gardening but seriously is that all!???!!!) AND WHY THE FREAKING HELL IS EVERYONE DEFENDING ELAIN WITH THE WORDS “Elain is Elain”!??? ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?? WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN!!?? I’m sick and tired of her getting away with everything because she’s everybody’s darling! Lucien deserves so much better than that! She can’t even talk to him for a few minutes? She can’t even thank him for the present he got her? Where was her present for him?! And just for the record: LUCIEN DIDN’T WANT HER TO BE HIS MATE!!! He’s as innocent when it comes to their mating bond as Elain! It’s not his fault that they are mates and people better remember this when they judge him for trying to get to know her! She doesn’t even give him a chance to get to know her so she’s just cruel and mean in my eyes. If she doesn’t change her attitude in the next trilogy I’ll never ship her with anyone. Not even Az. No one! For all I care she can live with her precious flowers and become one of them! GRRRRRRR!!!! AKDFASDFJASLDFJKASDFLK! Okay, I’m fine now. XD”Elain, at least, would be too polite to send Lucien away when he wanted to help. She was too polite to send him away on a normal day. She just ignored him or barely spoke to him until he got the hint and left.”Those doe-brown eyes turned toward me. Sharper than I’d ever seen them. “And that entitles him to my time, my affections?”“No.” I blinked. “But he is a good male.” Despite our harsh words. Despite this Band of Exiles bullshit. “He cares for you.”“He doesn’t know me.”“You don’t give him the chance to even try to do so.”Cassian & Nesta:”A storm is going to hit in a few days. I’d like you to distribute this amongst those who might feel its impact the hardest.”Cassian is so, so damn precious and he’s stuck with Nesta! That’s not fair! I think when it comes to me disliking characters in this series it’s a tie between Nesta and Elain. I just hate them both. (I know I’m making a lot of friends with this review. *lol* But I just can’t help it!) I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to ship them but after seeing that Nesta still didn’t change... Well, I just can’t ship them. By now I don’t even know if her character can be redeemed and if Sarah doesn’t work her magic with her I’ll never board this ship. And it will take a HUGE amount of magic to make her character at least a little bit more likable! And to everyone out there who likes Nesta and thinks I’m mean: I know she has PTSD too and I know that she suffers at least as much as all the other characters around her do, but that’s no reason to lash out at the others. If she wants to be secluded from them, live in a cheap apartment, drink all day and sleep with every fae male that comes her way: Okay! But to hurt the others, to fight them even though they are trying to help her, to spend Feyre’s and Rhys money without asking them: That’s not okay!! How many people have to offer her help until she accepts it? How often will she hurt poor Cassian because she’s just too proud to acknowledge that she has a serious problem? Just like Lucien, Cassian deserves so much better than her and I think I’ll make a petition for both of them! #FreeCassian&LucienFromTheClutchesOfTheCruelArcheronSisters”Nesta is Nesta. She does what she wants, even if it kills her sister. I’ve offered her job after job, and she refuses them all.”Tamlin & Rhys:Forgiveness could be a gift to both, but what he’d done... “Do you want her to?”His green eyes were empty. “Do I deserve it?”No. Never.He must have read it on my face, because he asked, “Do you forgive me – for your mother and sister?”I’m not okay with the way Rhys treated Tamlin! Yes, he made mistakes, yes he hurt Feyre, but that doesn’t mean that they have to hurt him too! Rhys should have known better than that, he should have been better than that and he shouldn’t have kicked Tam when he was already on the ground. Everyone can see that Tamlin is hurting and to treat him like that? To say what Rhys said to him? WOAH!! That was just cruel, mean and uncalled-for. I’m feeling really sorry for Tam now and Rhys helping him with the elk doesn’t make this any better. He only helped him because he might need him in future, not because he actually cared. Where is your compassion for Tam, Rhys? Where is the Rhys of ACOMAF I fell in love with? I don’t see him anymore. *shakes head*”I hope you live the rest of your miserable life alone here. It’s a far more satisfying end than slaughtering you.”Elain & Az:Cassian sat up, the portrait of outrage. “No?”Azriel tucked in his wings. “Would you want people betting on you?”I think the only reason Az reacted like that is because he might feel guilty for liking Elain. It’s so obvious that Sarah wants them to end up together and all those little tense moments between them speak volumes about her intentions. But as I said: I can’t ship Elain with anyone right now. Az is too sweet and gentle to end up with her and I really don’t want them to be together. Not because I would begrudge him a relationship with her, but because I think that he deserves better than her. After Mor played with him for centuries Az deserves the world, and then some! If Elain doesn’t change and acknowledges her misbehaviour against Lucien then I can’t ship this ship. And quite honestly, if I’d be Az I wouldn’t want to be with someone who treats their mate like that.”Azriel emerged from the sitting room, a glass of wine in hand and wings tucked back to reveal his fine, yet simple black jacket and pants.I felt, more than saw, my sister go still as he approached. Her throat bobbed.”Rhys & Lucien:”I can let go of the taunts,” he said, scanning my face. “And the fact that he still harbors some hope of one day reuniting with Tamlin. But I cannot let go of how he treated you after Under the Mountain.”I’m just glad that Lucien became friends with Vassa and Jurian because as I already mentioned above, he obviously isn’t welcome at the Night Court. Rhys still doesn’t like him and Lucien deserves more than to be tolerated. He deserves to be respected, to be loved and cherished and not to be treated like sh*t! Also what the hell does Rhys even mean with how he treated Feyre after Under the Mountain? Lucien did nothing wrong, he was there for her, tried to help her, defended her against Tam, spoke up for her and confronted Tamlin. And what did he get in return? Tamlin reprimanded him and might have even physically hurt him, Ianthe abused him and Tam let it happen because he refused to take part in the ritual, and Feyre?! Do I really have to point out what Feyre did? She lied to him, claimed that Rhys had turned her and even after she came back to the spring court she continued to lie to him and hurt him even more by destroying the only place he called home. Hell, she even used him to antagonize Tam and to destroy his friendship with Lucien. A great friend she was to him! And this after everything he did for her Under the Mountain. Hell, he even got whipped because he helped her and almost died as well. To destroy your friends’ life is a great way to show him gratitude. Well done, Feyre! So WHO EXACTLY TREATED WHOM LIKE SH*T AFTER UNDER THE MOUNTAIN, RHYS???!!!! Mhmm??? Care to enlighten me? And one more thing before I come to the end of thisrantreview: Lucien was in no position to help Feyre because he suffered from PTSD too. That’s something everyone always seems to forget. You can’t help someone else if you’re drowning yourself. And people better keep that in mind before they talk badly about him.Conclusion:I really thought I’d enjoy this novella and then move on to the next trilogy but for some reason those 229 pages kinda irked me. Big time. *lol* I guess that’s mostly due to the fact that all the things I already criticized in ACOWAR seemed to be even more prominent in this short story and I just couldn’t ignore it any longer. Also all the chapters we got from Mor’s POV didn’t contribute anything to the story, which is the main reason I didn’t even mention her in my review. All told this was a nice addition to the first trilogy and a good segue into the next one and I really hope that Sarah J. Maas will tackle all those issues I just pointed out. After all, “Hope dies last”! ;-PThis fanart was made by:https://twitter.com/Niruskyart",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50659471-a-court-of-frost-and-starlight,A Court of Frost and Starlight.txt
Legendary,"Meehhh. What a disappointment.***Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog***Legendary by Stephanie GarberBook Two of the Caraval seriesPublisher: Flatiron BooksPublication Date: May 29, 2018Rating: 3 starsSource: eARC from NetGalleySummary (from Goodreads):A heart to protect. A debt to repay. A game to win.After being swept up in the magical world of Caraval, Donatella Dragna has finally escaped her father and saved her sister Scarlett from a disastrous arranged marriage. The girls should be celebrating, but Tella isn’t yet free. She made a desperate bargain with a mysterious criminal, and what Tella owes him no one has ever been able to deliver: Caraval Master Legend’s true name.The only chance of uncovering Legend’s identity is to win Caraval, so Tella throws herself into the legendary competition once more—and into the path of the murderous heir to the throne, a doomed love story, and a web of secrets…including her sister's. Caraval has always demanded bravery, cunning, and sacrifice. But now the game is asking for more. If Tella can’t fulfill her bargain and deliver Legend’s name, she’ll lose everything she cares about—maybe even her life. But if she wins, Legend and Caraval will be destroyed forever.Welcome, welcome to Caraval...the games have only just begun.What I Liked:I'm actually a bit disappointed by this book, which is of course very surprise given how much I loved Caraval, and given how much everyone has loved Legendary. I felt so meh about this book while reading it, and when I finished it, I was left with a rather sour taste in my mouth. Definitely not what you would want to feel after reading a supposed masterpiece. But these things happen.Caraval followed Scarlett Dragna, who entered Caraval in order to save her younger sister Donnatella. Legendary follows Tella, who enters Caraval in order to save her and Scarlett's mother Paloma, who has been missing for years. Paloma is trapped in a card of the Deck of Destiny, a cursed deck of cards that contains the Fates. If the Fates are released, chaos will ensue (or something like that). If Legend gets the Deck, he could gain the powers of all of the Fates in the Deck. In order to save her mother, Tella must find the Deck of Destiny. In order to uphold her bargain with a mysterious criminal who gave her information about her mother, Tella must give the criminal Legend's true identity. Tella has neither of those things, and so she must enter Caraval and win - so that she will receive the ultimate prize from Legend. It's a tricky game that Tella is playing, and it is not without consequences - or sacrifices.In the first half of the book, I was pretty engrossed in the story. I wasn't totally sold on the whole finding-my-mother thing, but I was intrigued, and I liked Tella. I liked seeing Scarlett and Julian, though I hated the unnecessary drama (more on that below). I looooved Dante's appearances. I even loved Jacks' ridiculous, cruel self. The first half of the book was so fascinating.I liked Tella for the most part. In book one, I pretty much hated her and branded her the most selfish, unworthy sister ever. But I liked her in this book. She is bold and uninhibited, and while she seemed selfish in Caraval, she seems more selfless in this book. It's clear that she loves her sister, but is very guarded. She is selfless when it comes to Paloma, which is how this book came to be. Finding her mother is so important to Tella.I adored Dante and his wicked, charming self. I actually didn't totally care for him in book one, but he's so swoony and magical in this book. And not just in a love interest kind of way - the game of Caraval would not be the same without his presence. He's a charming devil, but he's also kind and sweet. He has a commanding presence about him and he has a way of popping up whenever he is needed (and whenever he isn't).There are many Scarlett/Julian cameos which I appreciate, though I wish they were all happy cameos showing Scarlett and Julian helplessly in love. I guess that will have to wait until Finale. Still, I'm glad that Julian and Scarlett are part of this book, and an important part.I liked the Dante/Tella romance, but there wasn't nearly enough. The author teased with this romance.Once I reached the second half of the book, I was kind of finished with it all. I'll talk about all of my dislikes next. I can't even say I liked the ending.What I Did Not Like:Ugh, where do I even begin? I just felt so meh about this book at the halfway mark and beyond. What went wrong, you might ask? I have no idea.I was never truly sold on the whole I-must-find-my-mother plot. It seemed forced and contrived, like the author desperately needed a good reason to bring back Caraval for a second time in a short period (like The Hunger Games), and so she grasped at straws and came up with Scarlett and Tella's missing mother. I just never bought into that plot. It didn't feel important.I didn't care for the barely-there tease of a romance that was Dante/Tella. I loved Dante. I liked Tella. I loved Dante/Tella. I didn't love the lack of kisses and swoon.And the implicated love triangle - for both Tella and Scarlett! Like two completely separate love triangles going on! What the heck! I thought Julian/Scarlett was a done deal but apparently not. You know what I hate? When girls want to make their man jealous and so they flirt with someone else. Or go find their ex. And they call it ""exploring their options"" or some bull***t and they want to bring about some competition between their man and the ex/side man. For real? This isn't cute. There's nothing wrong with dating. But there IS something wrong when you claim you love someone and yet you go look for your ex or another man just to make the man you love jealous, or some bull***. That's playing games and it's maddening. I'm talking about Scarlett.Oh but Tella is embroiled in her own love triangle, don't you worry. I know she is in love with Dante by the end of the story, and I know he loves her, but there is another guy that seems to be in love with Tella and noooooooo thank you. I actually LOVE this character and I wouldn't mind a Tella/This Character pairing IF Dante had never existed. Meaning, This Character as a love interest is so unnecessary. Why though. Why.Speaking of unnecessary, let's talking about all the unnecessary drama that is in this book. I already talked about Scarlett's bull**** that she's pulling with Julian, but I hate that she also let's so many factors bring down their relationship. She takes every little thing as a reason not to trust him. She knows who he is, what his role in Caraval is, and yet she whines about it all the time. I liked Scarlett in the first book. But she really got on my nerves in this book. And as much as I liked seeing her and Julian in this book, I would appreciated it more if there was less drama and more swoon. More of them working together as a couple, rather than Scarlett acting like a crazy girlfriend who runs off to her exes every time she believes something about her man (to put the situation in modern terms; Scarlett technically never runs to any exes, but hopefully you understand the picture I'm trying to paint). The drama is just so unnecessary. But I guess it's middle-book drama?I think this is part of my frustration with YA these days - the drama is so unnecessary, and sequels tend to suck. In adult romance, a book is a standalone and the story is done within that one book. Thank goodness.The ending of this book is not a happy ending. For anyone.Would I Recommend It:Honestly, this is one of those books where you have to read it yourself. Decide for yourself. 99% of the people who read this book love it, so what do I know? I felt so meh while reading at least half of this book. And the ending made me so sour. Not just because of the obvious love triangles, but because of the drama, and the cliffhanger, and it was just so stupid.But again, decide for yourself. I would say that if you're on the fence, maybe just stop with the first book. Wait until the third book publishes and binge-read the series. Or just stop with Caraval. Caraval had a lovely ending and you can imagine an epilogue of Scarlett and Julian 40 years down the road, happily ever after. No need to read about unnecessary drama.Rating:2.5 stars -> rounded up to 3 stars. Perhaps I'm being generous, and maybe I just really wanted to love the book. I was so excited about it and so prepared to love it like I did Caraval. But I'm glad I didn't buy this book because I would have regretted. I'm happy to have had the opportunity to review it (I was supposed to post this review two months ago, whoops), but I would have regretted spending the money on it. I will read Finale but it'll be a library request from me.Pre-read squees:MEEEEEEE, I WANT IT!!!!!!!!!!!",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36329818-legendary,Legendary.txt
Quests for Glory,"Review:Protagonists: After defeating the wicked School Master, our heroes went on to what was supposed to be their last Ever After, a happy one this time, for all involved, but when one story closes another begins. While Agatha and Sophie do feature heavily in this story, as well as everyone's favorite Coven of witches, this is very much Tedros's story. As Tedros becomes King of Camelot, the head that wears the crown is heavy indeed as Camelot is far from its Golden Age and is practically in shambles. Being king isn't quite what Tedros expected and when a new evil surfaces and seems to be gunning for Tedros and his friends, things become even more complicated. I love these characters so much, even Sophie most of the time, and this book doesn't exactly treat them too kindly. However, I sort of wouldn't want it any other way, these characters have to go through challenges and trials otherwise their (presumed) victory at the end of the series wouldn't feel earned and neither would their character development. The first trilogy really only dealt with certain flaws that these characters have, usually one or two per person, but people don't usually only have one or two flaws and so more character development is necessary for this new trilogy, Tedros's impulsiveness and over protectiveness, Agatha's need to control things, and Sophie's hubris and jealousy, okay Sophie's flaws aren't that new, but they weren't really resolved in the last trilogy either.Romance: Much like the previous books in this series there isn't a TON of romance in this book, at least not compared to most YA books, but the for the amount there is, it sure makes an impact. With the annoying and aggravating love triangle finally, once and for all, behind them Agatha and Tedros are engaged and planning their wedding, however, royal duties and a new evil sort of stall that for the time being. Agatha and Tedros's romance has really only existed in times of war and when they're at peace, there can be some bumps in the road. I will say never once in this story did I doubt their love or even entertain the notion that by the end of this series they won't be together, but there are still some rough patches that they have to overcome, both personally and together, and while it's hard to watch them not be happy 100% of the time, I'm sure that by the end of this series they'll be all the stronger for it.World Building: Even though this was my MOST anticipated book for the year, I was a bit apprehensive toward it. In this age of reboots, revivals, and spin-offs, it's hard to know if a new or continued series in the same universe is what the author wants, what the publisher wants, what the readers want, or a combination of all three. I've read some series continuations that just feel like the author is dragging out the series for no good reason, luckily this isn't the case with this story. I wouldn't call it a continuation exactly, the original trilogy can stand by itself very easily, and this new trilogy has a very different vibe to the first one. It's darker and it goes places that the first trilogy didn't, that being said, while it feels more like a YA fantasy series, I do think it's still appropriate for the same age range as the first series, things are just more serious than they were before. We get to see more of the world, our characters have even greater responsibilities, and the villain they face is more cunning and manipulative than they've faced before.Predictability: I didn't know that much about this book going in, I didn't know who the new evil was, what it was after, I didn't even know what to expect in regards to the heroes that we saw seemingly having their Happily Ever Afters at the end of the previous book, because of that this book was pretty jarring. Unlike some people that I had seen that was excited about this book, I held no illusions that this would be a fluff book full of sunshine and rainbows, and yet I was still shocked at how dark this book got and how bleak it seemed at times. While most of this book was fairly unpredictable, there was one twist that I had theories about and being the ever inquisitive person I am, I sort of read the ending to see if I was right, I was FYI, and since that moment, every bit of foreshadowing felt like another log added to the fire and while I can't comment on how predictable this twist is, I will warn you against reading ahead. NO GOOD COMES FROM READING AHEAD!Ending: I'm not talking about the ending to this book. I can't, everytime I try to I ruin the ending, or at the very least I can see someone seeing through my vague words to the truth within. I'm just going to say this, the ending is intense, things happen, and I can't wait for book 5.Rating:This was my most anticipated book of the year, and it did not disappoint. Sure, it broke me, it chewed me up and spit me out and left me desperate for the next installment, but I can see why the author guided the story in the way that he did, on the one hand, I respect him for taking this story in such a bold direction, and on the other hand I'm cursing his name with every fiber of my being... no joke.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34201983-quests-for-glory,Quests for Glory.txt
A ​Court of Silver Flames,"”Your power is a song, and one I’ve waited a very, very long time to hear, Nesta”.Aviso: la primera parte de esta reseña va a estar libre despoilersy les diré cuando empiecen a aparecer para que puedan dejar de leerla si no quieren saber qué pasa.No sé por qué me sigo sorprendiendo de que Sarah J. Maas lo logre una y otra vez. Es absolutamente impresionante lo que esta mujer puede llegar a transmitir con sus palabras. De verdad, leyendo ACOSF sentí que me destrozaban hasta lo más hondo y que luego, poco a poco, me iban reconstruyendo y poniendo cada pieza en su lugar.Como muchos aquí, debo confesar que no estaba tan emocionada por este libro porque se centraría en Nesta. Pero, así mismo, tengo que admitir que me comí todas y cada una de mis reservas y que, leyendo cada página, entendí profundamente a Nesta, sus traumas, su sufrimiento, su personalidad, la culpa que siente todo el tiempo y la sensación de que nunca eres lo suficientemente bueno para nadie. Y no sólo la entendí, sino que me sentí jodidamente identificada. Y, claro, luego me di cuenta de que odiaba tantísimo a Nesta porque reflejaba las partes más horribles de mí misma.ACOSF es un libro tremendamente intenso y lleno de emociones, de momentos de confrontar los sentimientos más oscuros, de arrepentimientos, rabia y odio. Pero también es una historia que lleva a Nesta en un camino que le permite enfrentar todos los demonios que tiene por dentro, todas las cosas que se ha guardado durante años, las decisiones que le quitaron de las manos y su odio hacia sí misma. Y, a pesar de lo oscuro que es el pozo en el que está y de lo duro que es el camino, Nesta se va a dar cuenta de que siempre va a existir alguien al otro lado de esa oscuridad para tenderle una mano, para caminar junto a ella y para recordarle una y otra vez que sí que se merece el amor de sus amigos y de su familia. Que nunca va a estar sola.En serio, no les puedo decir con palabras lo hondo que me llegó esta historia al corazón. Sí, es el libro máshotde Sarah J. Maas y todas esas escenas están diseñadas para ser leídas mientras estás en una tina llena de hielo porque… joder. Y obviamente las marqué todas y casi me da un infarto leyendo otras. Y también mucha envidia. Pero más allá de eso, creo que eran una forma súper poderosa de comunicar lo mucho que Nesta necesitaba una distracción, salirse de sus pensamientos durante unos momentos… u horas (because Fae lovers, jajaja) porque estar dentro de su cabeza era demasiado doloroso. Y la entiendo.Y Cassian… ay, ¿cómo puede existir alguien tan bueno, valiente, sensible y paciente? Si amaron a Cassian en los libros anteriores, en este van a querer abrazarlo (y más cosas, ejem) hasta que todo esté bien para él. No se pueden imaginar todo lo que conocemos sobre Cassian en ACOSF, sobre su pasado, sus sentimientos, sus miedos y, sobre todo, cómo es tan genuino como para siempre demostrar lo mucho que le importan quienes son cercanos para él, todo lo que estaría dispuesto a hacer y soportar por ellos. En este libro, Cassian enfrenta toda la tormenta de proporciones épicas que significa estar cerca de Nesta, pero lo hace porque sabe que ella está en un lugar oscuro, que está luchando por salir de allí y él la entiende… porque ha estado él mismo en ese camino antes. Joder, es que, de verdad… después de leer este tipo de cosas, ves a las personas del mundo real y te das cuenta de que eso no existe. Ojalá todos pudiéramos tener la certeza de que, cuando salgamos de nuestros momentos más oscuros, siempre va a estar alguien allí esperándonos para decirnos que todo va a estar bien o incluso sólo para sonreírnos o abrazarnos.Ahora, obviamente todo el libro no se centra únicamente en Nesta y Cassian, sino que Sarah J. Maas nos presenta una nueva amenaza que puede, nuevamente, destruir todas las Cortes e incluso afectar al mundo de los humanos. Pero esta es una amenaza mucho más antigua, poderosa y letal de lo que el Rey de Hybern pudo llegar a ser. Más adelante hablaré de ello, pero me gustó que hubiera una historia paralela de conflicto, de magia arcana y de monstruos que no pueden volver a caminar libremente por el mundo.Antes de empezar con la sección despoilers, tengo que decirles que amé profundamente volver a ver a los personajes que adoro. Feyre, Rhysand, Mor, Amren y Azriel no son solamente sombras en el fondo de las escenas de ACOSF, sino que siguen siendo importantes y están allí para los momentos más críticos. Ahora, que ellos sean ligeramente menos importantes en este libro que Cassian y Nesta no quiere decir que Sarah J. Maas no los vaya a usar para rompernos el corazón, triturar los pedacitos, sumergirlos en ácido y luego incinerarlos. De verdad, es tremendo… Y lo único que diré, y que discutiré más a fondo más adelante, es que les juro que no pude parar de llorar con el último 10% del libro. Y no precisamente de felicidad.Vamos con losspoilersy con Isa perdiendo la cabeza… de nuevo.•••1. Sí, vamos a hablar de la dedicatoria del libro. Cuando la leí al principio dije como “oh, vaya, bueno”, pero ahora que la estoy releyendo y estoy escribiendo esta reseña, puedo decirles que casi lloro. Dice”For every Nesta out there, climb the mountain”.2. Las pesadillas que tiene Nesta nos dan una pista de todo lo que está batallando por dentro desde que la sumergieron en elCauldrony, joder, poco a poco entendemos por qué es como es. Nadie que lidie con pesadillas que describe como el frío antes de las estrellas, el vacío antes del infierno, puede siquiera fingir estar bien.3. ¿Cómo me atreví a juzgar a Nesta sin saber que ella sentía la inmortalidad como un fuego eterno y no como una serena juventud? Son estas pequeñas frases las que nos dan, incluso en las primeras páginas, las pistas que necesitamos para ver lo destrozada que está, que toda su mala actitud es una coraza para protegerse.4. Me rompe el corazón ver a Cassian al principio del libro admitiendo que el fuego helado de los ojos de Nesta siempre había sido una tentación para él. Y es que justo lo piensa cuando está en su apartamento destartalado en donde ella se ha estadofuckinga cuantos machos Fae quisiera y bebiendo hasta perder el conocimiento… Y lo peor es que Nesta tiene a un macho en su cuarto en ese momento. Agh.5. Y luego ella admite para sí misma que todo ese sexo con desconocidos, el alcohol y la música la ayuda a apagar un poco ese fuego frío y oscuro que la consume desde que la forzaron a entrar alCauldron. Nesta siempre ha estado muy rota y siento que la hemos juzgado demasiado sin saber exactamente lo mal que lo estaba pasando dentro de su cabeza.6. Lo triste es que hay una cita que dice que ese sexo no la hacía sentir nada más allá de un momento fugaz de liberación de ese poder cataclísmico que hay dentro de ella. Pero luego se ríe un poco y dice que incluso los siglos de experiencia que algunos machos Fae tienen no los hacen buenos en la cama, jajaja.7. EL HORROR del momento en el que Cassian vuelve a ese apartamento y le dice que se nota que ni siquiera se ha dignado a cambiar las sábanas entre sus visitantes PORQUE PUEDE OLERLOS. Dioses, en serio Nesta está en un punto muy bajo en ese momento.8. Es tremendo cuando Feyre y los demás le dan un ultimátum a Nesta: o accede a entrenar con Cassian por las mañanas y a ayudar a las acólitas de la biblioteca por las tardes e intenta enderezar su vida o la van a enviar de vuelta al mundo humano. Esa pelea y esa conversación son durísimas, pero tenían que darle un empujón para que empezara a salir de ese pozo.9. AMO A RHYSAND. Hay un momento en el que está hablando con Cassian después de la “intervention” de Nesta. Y Cass le dice que tiene que volver a entrenar porque no querría que Feyre, sumate, encontrara partes blandas en su cuerpo. Y RHYS RESPONDE QUE ELLA NUNCA ENCUENTRA NADA BLANDO Y OMG, JAJAJA. Y luego hablan de que Rhys les dio el día libre a los sirvientes y Cassian cree que es para que no los escuchen pelear después de lo de Nesta, pero Rhys le dice que no son las peleas lo que no quiere que escuchen, AIUDA.10. Se me rompió MAL el corazón cuando Cassian vio el retrato de Feyre y Rhys juntos, sus anillos y a ellos mismos y lo invadió ese sentimiento de querer lo que ellos tienen, a alguien especial a su lado. POBRECILLO MÍO.11. Ay, dioses, y más adelante Cassian dice que tiene que alejarse mucho de la casa del río porque no quiere ni oírlo ni sentir su poder cuando Rhys… acabe. PERO ES QUE ESO NO ES TODO. Luego menciona como quien no quiere la cosa que, cuando eran más jóvenes, Az, Rhys y Cassian se f*llaban a muchísimas hembras Y GENERALMENTE EN LA MISMA HABITACIÓN. ¿ES QUE NADIE VA A HABLAR DE ESTO? O sea… dioses. A mí nadie me puede quitar de la cabeza que esos tres…you know. QUIERO UNFANFICDE ESTO YA MISMO.12. AMO cada vez que Cassian molesta a Nesta recordándole lo mucho que le gusta leer novelas eróticas, jajaja.13. Uf, también me rompe el corazón los momentos en los que Nesta admite para sí misma que sabe lo desagradable que es con los demás, lo dura que es la coraza que la rodea y lo asustada que está ella misma de ese pozo infinito de poder oscuro que tiene dentro de ella. Y hay una cita en la que dice que siempre se sintió cómoda siendo como un lobo, como un depredador, pero que cuando llegó el momento de eliminar a ese ser feroz, se dio cuenta de que la había devorado incluso a ella.14. Ehhh… ¿podemos hablar de que Rhys sigue siendo un loquillo? Es que le habla por el vínculo mental a Cassian en medio de dos… eh…roundscon Feyre,if you know what I mean.15. A ver, todos sabemos que, tarde o temprano, Cassian y Nesta van a hacerlo sobre todas las superficies de la Casa, pero es que toda la tensión previa es la que me matabaaaaaa. ¡La tensión y las frases con doble sentido y los gruñidos bajos! En el primer día de entrenamiento, Cassian le dice a Nesta, con voz súper grave, que le alegra que se haya levantado lista para jugar. Y ELLA SE DERRITE AUNQUE NUNCA LO ACEPTARÁ EN VOZ ALTA… todavía.16. PERO LO QUE SÍ RECUERDA ES ESE MOMENTO EN LA BATALLA FINAL, ahhhh. O sea, cuando pensaron que iban a morir y él la besó y le dijo que desearía haber tenido más tiempo, pero que la encontrará en esta vida y las siguientes. Es que me muero. Y Nesta admite mentalmente que nunca deja de pensar en ese momento. Ayyyyyy, ya bésenseeeee.17. Sarah J. Maas me quiere matar porque luego Nesta dice que si Cassian cree que todo esto de entrenar va a terminar con ella subiéndose a su cama, que está muy equivocado. Y él dice que eso está clarísimo, que él no se va a subir a la cama de ella, PORQUE ES ELLA QUIEN VA A SUPLICAR ESTAR EN LA CAMA DE CASSIAN. AYUDA, NECESITO AGUA FRÍA.18. Y no soy la única que necesita hielo porque cuando Cassian ve a Nesta en losIllyrian leathersde entrenar, que son pantalones y equipo muy ajustado, el pobre casi muere y empieza a fantasear sobre todo lo que haría quitándole esos pantalones y… uf.19. Y justo después de esas fantasías Cassian recuerda que no ha tenido más compañía que su mano desde hace más de dos años, cuando lo hizo duro y rápido contra una pared de ladrillo con una hembra cualquiera que encontró en un bar. O SEA, CASSIAN ESTÁHORNYY LA QUE NOS ESPERA EN ESTE LIBRO… MADRE DE TODOS LOS DIOSES.20. Esos primeros días de entrenamiento cuando Cassian lleva a Nesta a Windhaven y ella se niega a levantarse de una roca y entrenar son tremendos. Y es obvio que todos losillyrianse están burlando de Cassian por dejar que una mujer tan terca le gane… y aunque Nesta sabe que lo está haciendo ver débil y lo odia, no puede ceder porque siente que es mejor que la odie a que se acerque. MI CORAZÓN.21. Parte de la razón por la que este libro me enseñó a no odiar a Nesta es que entendemos mucho más cómo piensa. Y me identifiqué un montón, de verdad. Verla a ella era verme a mí en los momentos más horrorosos de salud mental. Cuando ella dice que odia todo lo que es, que está absolutamente exhausta y que está cansada de querer estar en un lugar que no sea su cabeza… wow.I felt that.22. Me encantó la conversación que tienen Amren y Cassian en la que ella le dice que deje que Nesta cave su propia tumba, pero que al final le ofrezca su mano. Que no se rinda y siga ofreciéndole su ayuda para salir de ese lugar oscuro.23. FAAAAAAAN de que Lucien diga que Tamlin está sufriendo y que desde el final de la guerra no ha adoptado su forma Fae, sino que está vagando por su corte como la bestia que es.Fucker.24. Sabes que se vienen problemas cuando empiezas a enterarte de que las criaturas poderosísimas que inclinaron la balanza en favor de la Corte de la Noche tienen hermanos. En este caso, nos presentan a Koschei, el hermano delBone Carver. Y que parece que está aliado con Briallyn, una de las reinas que entró alCauldrony que ahora quiere recuperar laDread Trove, una colección de objetos poderosísimos, hechos por elCauldronmismo, que tiene el poder de empezar otra guerra y borrarlos a todos del mapa.Oh, joy.25. Hay una mañana en la que Nesta casi no puede moverse porque la noche anterior intentó bajar las 10.000 escaleras que separan a la Casa de Velaris. Y Cassian se da cuenta en el desayuno y la molesta con que no se puede ni parar. Y ella lo hace apoyándose un montón en sus manos, pero él le dice que no cuenta si son las manos las que están haciendo todo el trabajo. Y ELLA LE DICE QUE SON SUS MANOS LAS QUE DEBEN ESTAR OCUPADAS TODAS LAS NOCHES, OMG. Entonces Cassian le responde con voz grave que si es eso lo que le enseñan sus libros eróticos, que sólo se hace por la noche. Él nota Y HUELE lohotque se pone ella y sigue diciendo que se puede hacer en cualquier momento, con la luz del día, durante un baño o incluso después de una LARGA Y DURA sesión de entrenamiento. En serio, lean este libro con hielo a la mano.26. ¡Lo peor es que toda esa conversación sucede mientras Az también está en la mesa con ellos! Y al final, cuando Nesta se va, Azriel le dice a Cassian que lo va a tener muy jodido, pero él ya no lo está ni escuchando porque en su cabeza se está imaginando todo lo que las manos de Nesta podrían hacer con él y JODER, LES DIJE QUE ESTE LIBRO ES DEMASIADO CALIENTE. Y ESO QUE NO HA SUCEDIDO NADA.27. Uf, golpe bajo cuando, en medio de una pelea porque Nesta sigue negándose a entrenar en Windhaven, Cassian también explota y ella le responde diciéndole que genial, que menos mal ya no lo va a tener babeando detrás de ella y que le costó mucho entender las señales de que ella no lo quería. Y MALDITA SEA, OBVIAMENTE LO QUIERES. Y ÉL A TI. Pero también entiendo la reacción de querer alejar a todo el mundo cuando ni tú te soportas a ti misma.***SIGUE EN COMENTARIOS***",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53138095-a-court-of-silver-flames,A ​Court of Silver Flames.txt
House of Earth and Blood,"I'm onBookTubenow! 😊“Through love, all is possible.”To be honest I don’t even know where to start with this review. This book was great in so many different ways that I’m having a really tough time to sort my thoughts and feelings. What I can definitely tell you is that this book is one of the slower ones. It has 803 pages and up to page 500 every single one of them is used to build up the plot and to introduce all the characters. I know a lot of other people who reviewed“House of Earth and Blood”actually didn’t like this long build up and saw it as a huge flaw but personally I think that it was important for the storyline.Are 500 pages to introduce the characters and the world setting too long? Maybe. But in this book it worked for me. I guess everyone who ever read high fantasy knows that plenty of pages go into the history of the MCs and the world building. (Quite honestly sometimes you’d even get pages of descriptions of the surroundings. I’m looking at you LOTR!!! *lol*) Every info I got in HOEAB was interesting and important for the plot though so I’m definitely not complaining. ;-)Even the least important characters and side-characters had history and I was living and breathing for it. Sure, there are some characters like Tharion, Aidas and Queen Hypaxia I’d love to hear more about (and I’m sure I will in the next book) but considering the many different groups and the complexity of the world Sarah actually did a great job. This said the last 300 pages just about killed me and I couldn’t have stopped reading even if my life would have depended on it. *lol* Yes, it was THAT suspenseful. Quite honestly I have no idea how Sarah wants to top this book!!?? I mean this was book one in a series and my expectations for book two are so high they are scratching the sky. XD Before I think about the next book let’s speak about this one first, okay?! ;-PThe characters:Welcome to Crescent City! The city of many possibilities and ALL the spoilers! *lol* So if you don’t want to be spoiled and haven’t read the book yet, I’d recommend to take the next bus out of town because this is going to be a spoiler festival! ;-)Bryce Quinlan:“Do you own any weapons?” The purely male gleam in his eye told her that he assumed she didn’t.“Bother me again,” she said sweetly, just before she shut the window in his face, “and you’ll find out.”I love Bryce so freaking much, I can’t even! This girl is the BEST! I love as good as everything about her and her many flaws only made her even more likable in my eyes! This is a character I could totally relate to and she felt very real! I mean she’s stubborn, clever, resilient, funny, loyal and compassionate. Yes, at times she’s even reckless but it’s all just limited to pushing her boundaries. She never really goes overboard unlike some of Sarah’s other characters and that was really refreshing. Bryce is a very self-confident character and knows exactly what she wants and she’s not only working hard but also has both feet on the ground. The way she dealt with Micah?! OMG!!! That’s a fierce woman right there! *lol* I respect her character and I hope we’ll get to see even more of it in the next book!”It’s easier for me – when people assume the worst about what I am. It lets me see who they really are.”Hunt Athalar:”In the harsh bathroom firstlights, his light brown skin was pallid under the black band of thorns across his brow. The tattoo, he’d learned to live with. But he shrank from the look in his dark eyes. Glazed. Empty. Like staring into Hel.”I kinda liked his nickname. Umbra Mortis definitely has some ring to it. *lol* This said I also think in many ways Hunt was the broken, powerful “alphahole” Sarah J. Maas has written about so often. Just like with Rowan and Rhysand his background story is heavy and quite violent which was no surprise because obviously Sarah likes to write about men with baggage. ;-P Of course I still liked him and rooted for his character he just reminded me a lot of all the other men Sarah wrote about. What I certainly didn’t expect was his betrayal and the fact that he knew about the drugs all along! This came as such a surprise and his involvement totally threw me. XD Then again it probably shouldn’t have surprised me. After all he didn’t regret any of his actions and said so multiple times. I wonder where Sarah will go with his character in future.”By the time Ramuel decided to let me serve as his assassin, it had been nine years since I’d seen sunlight. Since I’d heard the wind or smelled the rain. Since I’d seen grass, or a river, or a mountain. Since I’d flown.””There were some of the Fallen who accepted the halo and slave tattoo, you know. After a few decades, they accepted it. Stopped fighting it.”“Why have you never stopped?”“Because we were right then, and we’re still right now. Shahar was only the spear point. I followed her blindly into a battle we could never have won, but I believed in what she stood for.”Danika Fendry:”It was unheard of, for a shifter to have that sort of power, yet all the standard childhood tests had confirmed it: once Danika Dropped, she’d become a considerable power among the wolves, the likes of which had not been seen since the elder days across the sea.”If I’m completely honest I probably would have married Danika before dating Bryce! *lol* I loved her character so much and I really wish there would have been even more of her. I mean I already knew Danika was going to die, but I wasn’t prepared of how fast I’d grow fond of her and her pack! She was such an amazing person and her death was horrible. >_< At least as horrible as her own mother! I swear, Sabine certainly didn’t make it easy to like her. If there is even the slightest possibility that Danika gets reborn and reappears in the next book I’d be so here for it. XD Is it possible, Sarah? Please! *makes huge puppy eyes*”Her goal was to protect you. Always. Even from yourself.”Sandriel:”She and the commander of her triarii, Pollux, take cruelty and punishment to new levels.” He clenched his jaw, shaking off the blood-soaked memories. “They’re not stories to tell on a busy street.” Or at all.”That angel most definitely was no angel at all and should have burned in Hel. I hated Sandriel with a fierce passion and I really wish she would have died in the rebellion! It’s not right that a cruel person like her was that powerful and even though she got what she deserved I still think that her death was too quick. She should have gone to prison for eternity and not died that quickly. >_< Well, she’s dead now and won’t cause any more trouble. XDTharion, Queen Hypaxia & Aidas:Aidas had nearly vanished into nothing when he added, the words a ghost slithering through the room, “The Oracle did not see. But I did.”Okay, those three were just side characters but each one of them was super intriguing and I would have loved to get more of their background story!!! Like seriously! Just give me more! Aidas the Prince of the Chasm was one hell of an interesting character and Tharion as well as Queen Hypaxia easily won me over as well. I always knew that med witch was suspicious but I didn’t even think about the possibility that she might be Ruhn’s betrothed. *lol* Let’s hope all of them will be a part of the next book! <3“I know the costs of war, Governor.” Bold male, to say that, to look Sandriel dead in the eye.The relationships & ships:Bryce & Hunt:”Only sorrow lay here. And something like understanding. Like she saw him, as he’d seen her in that shooting gallery, marked every broken shard and didn’t mind the jagged bits. Under the table, the toe of her high hell brushed against his boot. A little confirmation that yes – she saw his guilt, the pain, and she wouldn’t shy from it.”What I really loved about their relationship is that it grew steadily. There was no insta-love or some unnecessary drama. They started out as two strangers that both knew about the other’s reputation and didn’t trust each other. The more they got to know each other and the more time they spent together, the more they started to see the true person behind all their bravado though. It was so refreshing to see them develop a really close friendship. Sure, there was attraction but it was just a part of their friendship and didn’t define it. I adored how they started to take pictures of each other to make new memories and how just to be around each other helped them to deal with their problems. They both had a lot on their plate but together they managed to pull through it. I still can’t believe that Hunt was in on the dugs though. That was quite a shocker and I’m kind of worried Sarah will pull a typical Maas and make us dislike Hunt in the next book. So far all her books started out with a love interest the MC would die for and then she ended up with someone completely different. *lol* It would be such a shame if that happened in here too. I guess only time will tell. XD”And she tried not to look too shocked when he laid his head on her thigh, his arm coming across her to rest on the pillow. A child laying his head on his mother’s lap. A friend looking for any sort of reassuring contact to remind him that he was a living being. A good person, no matter what they made him do.””You’re my friend. Who watches trashy TV with me and puts up with my shit. You’re the person I don’t need to explain myself to – not when it matters. You see everything I am, and you don’t run away from it.”He smiled at her, let it convey everything that glowed inside him at her words. “I like that.”Bryce & Ruhn:”He’d wounded her, and it had scared the Hel out of her that he held such power. That she had wanted so many things from him, imagined so many things with her brother – adventures and holidays and ordinary moments – and he had the ability to rip it all away.”Ahhh I absolutely loved this sibling bond! I mean yes, at the beginning of the book Bryce is keeping her distance to Ruhn and doesn’t want to have to do anything with him, but to be honest the reason for that was pretty shady if you ask me. I mean yes, they had a fight, but it’s no reason to avoid your brother for years. XD The explanation why she brushed him off was pretty lame but then again there are siblings in real life that don’t talk with each other for ages because of one silly thing. Believe me I’ve seen it – siblings that didn’t talk to each other for 30 years because of some minor matter and died without reconciling – so I suppose it might be realistic after all. I’m just glad Ruhn and Bryce are talking again and I definitely want to find out more about Ruhn in the next book. He was just a small part in here and I’m very curious about him and his life. Also I really thought Ruhn might be bi or pan but then Queen Hypaxia appeared and I guess that’s it. >_< I’m pretty certain my queer ass won’t see a real LGBTQ+ pairing in this series as well. Which is a shame but then again it’s probably better if Sarah doesn’t write them. I mean not every straight author can pull off a realistic queer rep so I respect her for steering clear of it. It takes guts to say “no” and to know your own limits. ;-)”His blue eyes gleamed in the streetlights, dawn still far off. A breeze off the Istros ruffled his black hair. And it was the tears that filled his eyes, the wonder in them, that had Bryce launching forward. Had her throwing her arms around her brother and holding him tightly.Ruhn didn’t hesitate before his arms came around her. He shook so badly that she knew he was crying.”Bryce & Syrinx & Lehabah:��My friends are with me and I am not afraid.”THOSE THREE BROKE MY FREAKING HEART!!!! AHHHH!! I’m still crying for Lehabah!!! This little precious fire sprite!!! I can’t!!! T_T I loved Lehabah so much! She was so fierce and compassionate and had quite an attitude but ahh that only made her even more likeable! I loved that she always called out Bryce on her coldness and unfriendly behaviour and that she was such a gossip. *lol* I can’t believe she died and the scene when she fought to give Bryce those precious seconds had me in tears. I was SOBBING reading that scene!!! SOBBING! T_T I’m still not over it. I guess I’ll never be. Also Syrinx is such a precious creature! <333 I want a Syrinx as well!Bryce sobbed, “I bought you, and now I set you free, Lehabah.”Lehabah’s smile didn’t falter. “I know,” she said. “I peeked in your drawer.”And despite the monster trying to break loose behind them, Bryce chocked on a laugh before she begged, “You are a free person – you do not have to do this. You are free, Lehabah.”Yet Lehabah remained at the foot of the stairs. “Then let the world know that my first act of freedom was to help my friends.”Bryce & Danika:”Bryce patted Danika’s silken head as she passed. Danika nipped her fingers, teeth flashing.Bryce chuckled, entering the narrow kitchen.”The bond between Danika and Bryce was so amazing!!! <333 I’m such a sucker for close friendships and found family and Danika and Bryce were like the embodiment of this trope! They had a friendship you rarely find and I count myself lucky to have the same kind of closeness with my bestie. The tender gestures, cuddling, hugging, all those physical gestures of affection but also the strong mental bond and spiritual closeness, it was all there with Bryce and Danika, which is the reason why I loved them both so much! <333 Ahh how I wish Danika wouldn’t have had to die. But that moment when Danika answered and told Bryce to “light it up”. OMG!!! She made the drop with her, from the other side she still helped Bryce and helped her to make the Drop!!! I can’t! I just can’t!!! Those two are killing me! <333 *weeps in a corner* I really wish Danika wouldn’t have died. T_TShe whispered. “I’m scared.”Danika grabbed her hand again. “That’s the point of it, Bryce. Of life. To live, to love, knowing that it might all vanish tomorrow. It makes everything that much more precious.” She took Bryce’s face in her hands and pressed their brows together.Conclusion:“House of Earth and Blood” was quite something and I loved to read this book! Sarah tackled so many important and interesting topics and she did it in a very sensitive manner. It might have seemed to be a slow paced book up to the 500 pages mark but I think it was necessary to build up the story like that. I have absolutely no idea how Sarah J. Maas wants to top this book but I’m more than just willing to find out! *lol* Let’s hope the wait for “Crescent City 2” won’t be all too long.

The Queen of Nothing,"1.)The Cruel Prince★★★★★1.5)The Lost Sisters★★★★★2.)The Wicked King★★★★★“By you, I am forever undone.”I can’t believe it’s over. I feel like I’ve been in love with Holly Black’s fae stories my entire life and seeing this series finally close means more to me than I have words for, truly. This series, this world, these characters, have brought me so much unconditional happiness, and I truly am not ready to say goodbye, but I do think this was a very perfect ending.Also, a couple things before I start this actual review: 1.)I vlogged this entire reading experience(and how I wrote this review) and I hope you enjoy! 2.) This review will talk about events that happened inThe Cruel Prince,The Lost Sisters, &The Wicked King, so please use caution while reading! And I will have a spoiler section for QoN later!After the very heartbreaking end ofThe Wicked King, Jude is now exiled from Faerie and a crown that no one knows she wears. Madoc is ready and willing to do anything to put Oak or himself on the throne, regardless of what Oak wants while living in the mortal realm with Vivi. Taryn is now married to Locke, for better or for worse, and regardless of what Jude thinks on the matter.“We have lived in our armor for so long, you and I. And now I am not sure if either of us knows how to remove it.”Everything feels like it is chaos, and at the start of this book we see Jude slowly accept her fate, while also learning the pain of her anger and betrayal. She is taking side-jobs from the fae residing among humans, and she just takes on a job that is about to really test her skills. Especially when she comes out of the job realizing that things might really not be going that great for Cardan in the realm of the fae. But Jude doesn’t care, right? But she gets an opportunity to go to faerie and see for herself, regardless of her exiled status, and the situation is a matter of life and death.It’s hard to say anything else without going into spoiler territory, but I truly loved this book so much. I can’t believe how much Holly Black was able to surprise me, especially with the amount of theorycrafting I truly believed I did. From the cover, to the title, to the sneak peaks we were given; I was truly not ready for the twists and turns of this book and this entire trilogy is just masterfully crafted.“I spent much of my life guarding my heart. I guarded it so well that I could behave as though I didn’t have one at all.”And at the heart of this book, I just really enjoyed the theme and discussion of all the different and complex relationships we will have in our lives. We see Jude constantly battling with herself and her feelings; from her past to her future, from her family to her crown, from her feelings to her heart. There are so many wars in this book, but most of them truly are from within Jude, and Holly Black really expertly talks about the human experience and existence.“But for one final night, he’s the father I remember best, the one in whose shadow I have—for better or worse—become what I am.”Relationships can be so very hard and so very not pretty. Obviously we get to see Jude and Cardan, obviously we get to see Jude and her sisters, but seeing Jude and Madoc? That’s what kept breaking me. How do you love a father who became your father by killing your own? A father that loves you so very much, but loves power more? Jude and Madoc are truly the kings of this book and this chessboard, and their dynamic is truly unlike one I’ve read before. So heartbreakingly beautiful, truly.This next section of my review is going to haveSPOILERS! Please do not read on if you have not readThe Queen of Nothingand all the rest of the books in this series! Also, like always, I’m going to do fangirl breakdowns because it warms my heart.“It feels good to be fighting someone other than myself.”➽Jude Duarte- My actual queen. Seeing Jude realize not only her worth, but that it is okay to hurt and to be angry, yet also that it is worth the risk to let people in sometimes; I don’t even have words, friends. Jude’s pain just resonated so much inside my heart and soul and I truly think she is one of the best literary characters I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading about.“He’s so beautiful, so perfectly, horribly, inhumanly beautiful that I can barely breathe.”➽Cardan Greenbriar- My entire heart. All of Cardan’s lines truly broke and healed me throughout this entire book. Seeing him be the king of his people’s dreams, but also the king of his own dreams? Forever crying. Also, we stan an otp power couple for life. Truly, for life; Jude, please never leave faerie again.➽Nicasia- We love a good redemption arc, wow.➽Grima Mog- Nothing but love and respect for my war general.➽Taryn Duarte- Oh Taryn. Listen, her pregnancy was expected, but her actually killing Locke was not. I will say that I think this was the weakest part of the story, and I truly wish we could have seen more, but maybe Holly Black is going to give us another few novellas or something. Especially with a certain bard boy? But seriously, I need so many more answers.➽Vivi- My 2019 bi-icon. I was rooting for Vivi and Heather so damn hard, and I was so scared at what Vivi was going to do this book, but she was amazing through and through. When she told Madoc to bring his entire army? The biggest flex in all of 2019 literature and I was quaking.➽Oak- Wow, I’m going to love me a good spin-off.➽Madoc- Madoc was the character that probably made me cry the most throughout this entire series. Loving people can be so very hard, and each journey is so very different, but Madoc just really amplifies these statements and it hurts (in the best way possible) to read. The parallels between him and Jude, both truly born in blood, and seeing the different paths they take to fight each other, while always loving each other, it’s really something that I don’t have words for, but it is truly heartbreakingly beautiful.➽Locke- Wow, he actually did die and Taryn actually did kill him. The biggest bamboozle of the entire book, and please call me boo boo the fool from now on while I apply my clown makeup.Okay, let’s talk about some of the big things in this book while we are in this spoiler section, too. Let’s just get the snake out of the bag (end me). You know, with all the buzz about the 2019 YA book snake, I really didn’t expect for Cardan to turn into her. Wow, truly wow. I love a good fairytale twist in my fae stories, and it was truly one worthy of ballads. Seeing Jude realize that she would rather not have Cardan than only being able to have him controlled? I will be forever crying. So beautiful. Also, the sword she did it with? Truly forever crying.I will forever and always be so surprised that Locke was not the big bad of this series and honestly? He deserved a better death and storyline ender. Like, I couldn’t believe Madoc was truly the endgame villain. This book was still so perfect to me, but this was what truly let me down the most. I wanted a satisfying Locke death and a true villain story, but it felt bad that we didn’t get that.“Tell me what I must slay, what I must steal, tell me the riddle I must solve or the hag I must trick. Only tell me the way, and I will do it, no matter the danger, no matter the hardship, no matter the cost.”I also didn’t love how Cardan told everyone that him and Jude got married. I mean, trust me, I screamed and rolled around in my bed like I was thirteen, but I still wanted something more. Also, the exiled scheme he made up? Baby, that’s not it. But whatever, because when he told her that he loved her it was truly the best thing my eyes have ever read for all of 2019 and you won’t hear me complaining. Truly OTP status worthy and the best enemies to lovers I will probably ever read.I’ve had a few people tell me that they thought I’d find the ending a bit cheesy (no, this isn’t a pizza dad joke), and that’s valid, because it is a bit cheesy. But I just love these characters so much and they deserve so much happiness that I just felt really blessed to be able to experience that with them for an epilogue. Also, I have really high hopes for what is to come with Oak, because there is no way that Holly Black set that up to not masterfully tell what is to come for Faerie.I will also be honest and say that this was probably my least favorite in the series. Also, these books are always split up in two parts (or books), and the first half of this was six star worthy. Truly better than anything I’ve read this entire year. It was the last half (and cheesy epilogue) that didn’t quite live up to my expectations. But again, this series just means so much to me and it truly feels once in a lifetime to me.Overall, I just believe this is the series of my heart. Holly Black and her fae stories have truly shaped me into the reader and reviewer I am today. I owe her so much, and this concluding novel just felt like lifeblood to me. No other book has made me as happy reading. No other book has had me spam refreshing my kindle app to make sure it downloads. No other book has ever been more my brand. And I’m not sure if any book series ever will. It is a truly honor to read and review this book, and it’s more of an honor that some people correlate it with me. I know that no amount of words that I string together will ever adequately do justice to how much these books mean to me, but I promise to shout about them forever, and keep them in my heart always. And I hope that every reader has a series that makes them feel the wayThe Folk of the Airhas made me feel.Youtube|Blog|Instagram|Twitter|Tumblr|TwitchContent and Trigger Warnings:death, murder, war themes, gore, blood depiction, talk of cannibalism, and torture.Bonus – Park Jimin, forever and always my Cardan.

The Wicked King,"I hate this book.I hate it so much I can’t stop thinking about it. I hate it enough to wanna make 100 accounts to rate it one star over & over again.But I won’t, not because that’s immoral but becausethere can’t be hate unless there is love.There can’t be loss unless there is need. There can’t be hurt unless there is care.“I hate you,” I say, the words coming out like a caress. I say it again, over and over. A litany. An enchantment. A ward against what I really feel.So really, it’s my own damn fault.I all but handed Holly Black a gilded dagger, turned my back, and begged her toplease please stab me right in the feels, going so far as to give her directions to the place just south of my hopes and slightly north of my dreams.I am Jude and this book is myWicked King.And there is no better way, absolutely none, to convey how it feels to read its every page, every brush of ink, every curve and crease, than to quote the book itself:It has all the sinister pleasure of sneaking out of the house, all the revolting satisfaction of stealing. It reminds me of the moment before I slammed a blade through my hand, amazed at my own capacity for self-betrayal.(Please do excuse me for stealing lines—I do so because I am an inadequate piece of human soul and incapable of competing with the Faerie Queen who wrote this pure trove of gems).“Power is much easier to acquire than it is to hold on to.”I have said it before, and I’ll say it again: People don’t paint this series as it truly is.The Folk of the Airis not a light, romantic fairytale, however addictive; it’s a dark and deadly one—less a page-turner and more a temptress. It’s about tricks and snares, games and intrigue and pain and, above all else, power. Infectious, greedy, alluringpower.And that, all of that, weaves itself through every nook, around every thread of the books. It hugs Jude’s curves and flies from her lips, slides along Cardan’s tail and between his clever clasp. It wraps its hungry grasp around the characters, bathing, entombing, suffocating. And it, quite gloriously, circles the dynamics and bonds, twisting and blurring the lines of love and hate, want and fear, until it is one with its every angle, dip, and chip. I guess it makes sense some would mistake one for the other.Isak Danielson’s songPower(which you can find on mybook playlist) isThe Wicked Kingincarnate and why oh why didn’t I listen when people told me NOT to finish it before an exam and went ahead to do just that? Sigh, I’m a fool, yes, but a fool for Jude and Cardan. And that never ceases to be an honour.“Things are always super dramatic around here,” Vivi tells Heather. “Epic. Everyone acts as though they just stepped out of a murder ballad.”As I called this book apure trove of gems, I will proceed to refer to the treasures as the four most precious gemstones:Black Diamond:Jude Duarte“Once upon a time, there was a human girl stolen away by faeries, and because of that, she swore to destroy them.”I will fight every single person who dares call my Jude annoying or unbearable and anything else in the thesaurus for those adjectives. She is the definition of a brilliant badass queen and I am willing to rip throats to prove it. Metaphorically, of course.InThe Cruel Princeshe evolved from the girl who wanted to impress and fit in and fight for honour, to a ruthless, power-hungry, scheming star, and in this sequel her shine multiplies a thousandfold; so I suggest you all shield your eyes before you go blind from her magnificence.Exploring her hatred of vulnerability, her need for control, and her insistence on relentlessly pushing andpushingherself both physically and mentally to the brink of collapse until she’s achieved perfection and utter independence, made me relate to her on a level that bordered on discomfort, if comfort really had any meaning (at least to me) and I wasn’t such a self-absorbed bastard.The sheerwill. That, right there, is my most adored trait in human or faerie, reality or fiction.“You’re unwinding yourself like a spool. What happens when there’s no more thread?”“Then I spin more.”Anger or fear? Fear or anger?Jude would argue anger (unsurprisingly, that is, her being a furious hurricane and all) and I happen to agree. Both are overwhelming emotions that can drown and paralyse and turn one into a fool, while both can also motivate and embolden and turn one into a champion. However, there is a certain strand of arrogance interwoven with amger that fear happens to lack. And, you all know me, I would pick anger over fear any day.So I can do nothing less than shout my love for her from the rooftops, no mountains, asJude takes the hurt and weakness the Folk carved into her flesh and bone, adds it to the stew of her desire to be magic like them mixed with her obsessive knowledge of their rules and their ways and the music of their strings as they are pulled and plucked, and sprinkles it with a formidable amount of pleasure from the power and the dance and determination to learn and excel, watching it all bubble and burn.She is certainly my favourite cook, because she is better at being worse than them. Never, ever underestimate my little murderer’s strength, her skill at strategy, and her capacity for cruelty.Lastly, I want to raise a glass to the question Holly raises with this book:Is it good, or bad, for a ruler to contain those cutting, cunning impulses?Answer that as you will.Cat’s Eye Emerald:Cardan Greenbriar“Have you never heard that virtue is its own reward?” Cardan says pleasantly. “That’s because there’s no other reward in it.”Ahhhh, I am in love with this wicked king (while wanting to strangle him to death and back, ofc) and I’m not even sorry.I stand by my point in my review ofThe Cruel Princethat his most important difference from most wicked charming boys (or girls) in books, is hisabsolute lack of ambition.Hell, that’s also the main difference between him and Jude.This small (perhaps inconsequential to most fans) detail is so ridiculously highlighted for me because it makes him endearing and unique and helplessly adorable, adding to his irresistible charm as he languishes on life, andwhy am I swooning right now ugh.The Wicked Kingis undoubtedly the best installment in this trilogy and one of the reasons for that is Cardan’s beautiful, heart-stopping growth as a character. He goes from a person commited to, as Jude would put it, “being a layabout who does none of the real work of governance,” to finding himself, his resolve, mettle, fight—whatever you want to call it—because of how his feeling of powerlessness and fear trickle away, drip by drip, as he no longer has someone to inflame (Jude excluded). And, mostly, because of Jude pushing him unwittingly.He learns toownit.“The three of you have one solution to every problem. Murder. No key fits every lock.” Cardan gives us all a stern look, holding up a long-fingered hand with my stolen ruby ring still on one finger. “Someone tries to betray the High King, murder. Someone gives you a harsh look, murder. Someone disrespects you, murder. Someone ruins your laundry, murder.”I could go on for two more paragraphs about why he seems to “have a singular taste for women who threaten” him and why and how a certain type of power dynamic appeals to our dear twisted fearie as it, honestly, does to most of the messed up characters in this series, but I won’t bore you anymore with my psychological talk.I will just go ahead and carve a Cardan-shaped chamber deep in my cold, dark heart to trap this clever, cutting, shameless, straightforward yet playful boy and protect him at all costs.Burmese Ruby:The Jurdan Ship“If you’re the sickness, I suppose you can’t also be the cure.”I mean whoever wasn’t already abroad this ship should be careful because I might kindly push them overboard for being late to the party (let’s ignore the fact that I was also late to the general party shh).If book one was them warming up for the match, book two is them sparring at full swingand I am here for it.And “what is sparring but a game of strategy, played at speed?” So just as he is wary of her, bracing for her next blow while enjoying the game and trusting her completely, he is also going to land blows. Really, it’s only fair.“I have heard that for mortals, the feeling of falling in love is very like the feeling of fear. Your heart beats fast. Your senses are heightened. You grow light-headed, maybe even dizzy.”I think my second favourite aspect of their relationship (after the games and sparring match) is howtheir need and attraction and glimpse of a kindred spirit morphs into denial and fury and fiery hatred as they run away from the feeling they despise lacing through their love, all while being helpless to do so.Running at full speed on the tilted ground drenched with a rain of pain and desire, Cardan has already slipped. It’s Jude’s turn to do so.“Kiss me again,” he says, drunk and foolish. “Kiss me until I am sick of it.”Now, I’m going to make a confession. I was as stupefyingly petrified of their dynamic shifting as Jude was. Every step he took beyond her control, every claim he made to his own self, every fistful of power he dug up, I found myself screamingno nojust as much as I cheered his growth. Because I understand her fear of being out of control and powerless, and do not want him to hold more power than Jude. And that fear is idiotic and unfair, because the fact that one’s power should come out of another’s powerlessness needs to give everyone pause.He has capered while she schemed, it’s time for them to learn to be equals, with mutual trust even in their game of chess, having faith in the fact that their opponent and partner willnever land a killing blow.“For a moment,” he says, “I wondered if it wasn’t you shooting bolts at me.”I make a face at him. “And what made you decide it wasn’t?”He grins up at me. “They missed.”Violet Sapphire:Rest of the Rabble“Like the ant in the fable who labors in the dirt while the grasshopper sings the summer away.”“And has nothing left for winter,” I say.“I need for nothing,” he says, shaking his head, mock-mournful. “I am the Corn King, after all, to be sacrificed so little Oak can take my place in the spring.”✧Storytelling:I might’ve read only one trilogy byHolly Black, but I can safely say she is one true Weaver; taking the tale by the throat, dunking it in an ocean of vocabulary and punctuations, and threading the water and words into whorls of magic and enchantment. Thank you, Holly, for weaving waves of wailing tales for us.✧Worldbuilding:No words can capture and frame my love for this mystical, fairytaleish land of exotic, quiet allure, so I’m not even gonna try.“I’m still your father.”“You’re my father’s murderer,” I blurt out.“I can be both,” Madoc says, smiling, showing those teeth.✧Madoc:I could not tear my gaze away from this messed up father-daughter relationship. He, the monster who took everything from Jude, also gave her a new life, pushed her to her fullest potential (even while underestimating her), encouraged her fire (even while beating her down), was all is she had. And I lived for how thoroughly this facet of this dark tapestry, this theme of moving past and beyond the power of the person who raised you, burns throughout the book.P.S.Pain makes you strong? Sith much?“Your ridiculous family might be surprised to find that not everything is solved by murder,” Locke calls after me.“Wewouldbe surprised to find that,” I call back.✧Taryn the Betrayer:I argued in my review ofThe Lost Sistersthat Taryn likes the games and adventure and power play and is fierce enough to claim her own tale (while being hypocritical enough to deny it). And she does. But doesn’t mean she is not weak, because she is that, too. She escapes confrontation and discomfort like a sunflower constantly turning towards the sun to flee the darkness—and I’ve never much liked sunflowers. This adaptability is exactly what fascinates Locke, and this weakness is just what takes apart the trust between these two lost sisters.✧Locke the F***ing Fox:I know everyone hates and wants to kill this guy, but I can’t resist bringing him back to life after choking him for more of his playful, dangerous-but-fun fox games of backstabbing delight. *sheepish smile*“Revenge is sweet, but ice cream is sweeter.”✧Vivi the Humanlover:A moment’s appreciation for mt defiant yet chill, loving yet selfish knight-at-heart.✧Fala the Fool:Putting him here because NO ONE SEEMS TO CARE FOR THIS GEM WHY.

The Cruel Prince,"Once upon a time, a wicked girl with a cold, cold heart traipsed through a forest so light and stark. Trees of clean bark. Branches dangling with folk art.And it was thus she came upon a hole so, so dark.Our restless little devil looked through the hole and glimpsed trees of bark covered in blood, branches twisted and falling with a thud, screams coming out of the mud that had seen much brutal flood.So the girl backed up, and ran, and jumped.I fell into theHolly Blackhole for fun so dark.And now, it seems, I am stuck.Oops.“Nice things don’t happen in storybooks,” Taryn says. “Or when they do happen, something bad happens next. Because otherwise the story would be boring, and no one would read it.”Before picking upThe Cruel PrinceI, of course, had expectations. No, scratch that, I didn’t have expectations, I never do, never dare hope—I usually try to not expect much of a book so I wouldn't be disappointed—what I had was simply assumptions about how it was gonna be. And I was completely and utterly wrong.People make this seem like a romance-oriented book; it is not.This book is less about the romance (which only starts to show itself a little by the end) and more about games, intrigue and, most importantly, the characters. It’s about anger. Betrayal. Revenge. Secrets and, above all, power. This is the dangerous tale of a human girl who grew up in faerieland and has endured much cruelty and pain, is bullied at school, because of being mortal and weak.She will show you she is not.Let no one call Jude Duarteweak.That’s what comes of hungering for something: You forget to check if it’s rotten before you gobble it down.She will be the human who looks at all that faeries have, acknowledges that she, as a human, is unworthy of those things, still wants them anyways, and thus takes them. Faeries might always be better than her, but she can be much, much worse. It should not surprise you that I adore her, then.The Cruel Princeis a cruel, enchanting tale of a cruel, enchanting people in a cruel, enchanting world. And all that I said are the reasons why I will love it forever. With you, to the ends of time.As always, you can check out my chosen soundtrack for the series at the end of the review—I went slightly wild there and made a mash up of the three books’ covers to create one for my playlist.The odd thing about ambition is this: You can acquire it like a fever, but it is not so easy to shed.CW➾ abuse, bullying, drugging, speciesism (faeries over humans rather than humans over animals), self harm✧ Storyline ✧One ordinary night a not so ordinary man drops from the sky into an ordinary human neighborhood riding a not so ordinary horse. He dismounts and walks up to one of the many ordinary houses and, raising his not so ordinary fist, he knocks.The night is no longer ordinary.For inside the house, three little girls watch TV and eat fish sticks with ketchup. For one bears half-faerie blood, while the pair of full human twins do not. For an scared woman comes running from the kitchen and the man calls her wife and traitor. For he kills her and takes the three little girls to faerieland. For in Faerie, there are no fish sticks, no ketchup, and no television.“Because you’re like a story that hasn’t happened yet. Because I want to see what you will do. I want to be part of the unfolding of the tale.”What there is in Fearie is a court ruled by the High King, presiding over the three factions of the Seelie Court, the Unseelie court, and the wild fey. And that king has a general—a faerie whose wife left him pregnant with his heir, a faerie who slaughtered a family one not so ordinary night and took three human girls.Jude is the youngest of the three, the younger twin, and she wants nothing more than to belong, craves nothing more than being knighted and a permanent part of the court. Even if most of the faeries hate humans; even if she is bullied at school by the youngest prince and his gang; even if she is belittled and bloodied and nearly killed.So it should come as a surprise to no one that she would lie and spy and become a vengeful murderess who changes the game. It does anyways.“I am tired of caring,” I say. “Why should I?”“Because they could kill you!”“They better,” I say to her. “Because anything less than that isn’t going to work.”✧ Storytelling ✧Shame on you, Mary, for waiting so long to pick up a masterpiece ofHolly Black’s.A tale so well told. A twisted fairytale so mesmerising. An atmosphere so immersive and pulsing. An eye for detail and consideration and clever themes and additions. A hand wielding words and metaphors as a master swordsman would a sword.I read my first Black book and did not look back.“I’ve seen many impossible things. I have seen the acorn before the oak. I have seen the spark before the flame. But never have I seen such as this: A dead woman living. A child born from nothing.”✧ Characters ✧★Jude:Call her a wrecking ball if you want, call her an annoying bitch if you dare, I would only say you don’t comprehend the joy of jumping into the canyon of anger, the peace in throwing rules and caution into the wind, the freedom in crossing the line and embracing the glorious beauty of revenge. “It’s the thrill of leaping without being able to see the ground below you, right before you realize that’s called falling.” I would say that you’ve never known the colours. I would say you are blind.She is a prideful, unyielding fighter who hates being vulnerable, being controlled. She is a vengeful, violent liar who adores power, adores attention.She is angry and dark and probably needs to see a therapist but, if you told her so, would most likely tell you to go eff yo self and that she can manage herself quite nicely thank you very much.And if you think she’s starting to sound like me...then whatever do you mean *smiles sweetly*“If you hurt me, I wouldn’t cry. I would hurt you back.”I’d heardcriticism of Jude’s reaction to the trauma of her childhoodand agreed with it for the beginning chapters, but then I realised that it’s merely that she handles the trauma differently.What Jude does is escape thinking about what happened, flee her feelings and fear; and it naturally results in her becoming out of touch with her emotions. She endures and pushes it into the back of her brain due to not knowing another way to cope and that’s the way that comes naturally to her. She is always afraid, always on alert, so she’s grown numb and used to it, so she’s turned tired and angry, so she lashes out.In fact, her mental state is captured accurately, because our personality shapes our response to trauma the same way trauma shapes our personality.She doesn’t have nightmares not because her trauma has been ignored, but because she can’t calm her nerves enough to even sleep.Before, I never knew how far I would go. Now I believe I have the answer. I will go as far as there is to go. I will go way too far.And if you put that kind of personality under pressure, it acts much like an elastic object: springing upon release, going wild and hitting everything at close range. She was raised in a house of butchery by a man who delights in war and death and conflict. And because such a man was her father and such a man killed her father, this is the birth of a murderer. Her composed smiles coming unraveled, coming undone.“I thought I was supposed to be good and follow the rules. But I am done with being weak. I am done with being good. I think I am going to be something else.”★Cardan:A few months ago a friend of mine forced me to watch the kdramaBoys Over Flowersin exchange for me asking her to watch the BBCSherlock; the deal was that we’d each watch 6 episodes of our respective shows and stop after that if we’re no longer interested. I, ofc, stopped after 6 because I just can’t connect with kdaramas. But I’m glad I watched those episodes, because I can now write this:Cardan Greenbriar is literally and thoroughly Gu Jun-pyo fromBoys Over Flowers.But where I only found Jun-pyo entertaining, IloveCardan, probably because of Jude’s difference from the female lead of the show. With Jun-pyo it was just a petulant boyo lashing out and being angry and bullying and abusing a powerless girl (who still got back at him impressively but still, their personalities where the opposites) while with Cardanit’s a sparring match.I called him “a simple old-school bully” the very first time we were introduced, and I was both right and wrong. Right because he is an old-school bully, yet wrong because he is not simply so but playfully; Cardan is a clever cruel prince, an angry spoiled/abused child, and a charming adorable coward. Too young, too weak, too mean, too precious! But not ambitious, not like Jude.I blame you guys for being disappointed at first; it was unfair to feel annoyed that he couldn’t fill the shoes I’d thought Holly Black was intending for him when shewasn’tintending those shoes for him. He has his own shiny shoes to stand in and THANK GOD.“There’s safety in being awful.”✯Locke:First character who intrigued me with his bored, manipulative ways. I spent a long time just repeatingwhat’s his game what’s his gamein my notes, I swear, and I find it rather perfect that his game is just that—a game. This drama-loving fox is one I simultaneously want to kiss and kill and absolutely cannot get enough of.✯Taryn:Jude’s twin sister is much like her while still being the opposite. She, too, wants to belong and would do anything to achieve it; she, too, can be cold and manipulative as the faeries and craves their exotic danger, growing used to recognising bad things as good; and she, too, has had to become something else to survive, something not so human. But where Jude is wildfire, she is ice; one is raging, the other composed. Both burn you in the end.“Desire is an odd thing. As soon as it’s sated, it transmutes. If we receive golden thread, we desire the golden needle.”☆ Those aren’t the only ones that made an impact:Madocwith his anger issues and twisted love,Viviwith her raging selfish heart that encourages the same trait in others,Orianawho is way more than she seems. All layered, none all-evil, being a mix of cruel and gentle. I heard someone say this book has an all-Slytherin cast, and I’m inclined to agree—no wonder I enjoy them all so much.✧ Relationships ✧“Like taking a dare to run over knives, like an adrenaline strike of lightning, like the moment when you’ve swum too far out in the sea and there is no going back, only cold black water closing over your head.❥Romance:Can I just say Chapter 25 & 26? BECAUSE CHAPTER 25 & 26! To be frank with you, I wasn’t sure at first about these two as I had my doubts regarding Cardan being someone who could possibly match Jude in strength, but I now adore them because I realised the nature of dynamic is a game wheresheis the one with the power (while being terrified of him ever having any power) and he is drawn to that. He likes to challenge her, question her,tryto best her, while actually delighting in her holding a dagger at his throat.They spar; they fight; they have (more or less) the same personality, liars and deceivers and and power-oriented people.Their only difference is that he’s a pleasure-seeking coward where she’s a purposeful warrior, and that somehow makes them an even better match.“He’s flint, you’re tinder.”❥Familial Bonds:I’ve already talked too much so I’ll just say that the sisterhood, brother-sister bond, father-daughter relationship...all are written tangibly, conveying the complicated and contradictory feelings that come with being a family (and one so messed up as this) quite perfectly. It was a gem to read.✧ Worldbuilding ✧Faerie might be beautiful, but its beauty is like a golden stag’s carcass, crawling with maggots beneath his hide, ready to burst.This land of beautiful nightmares, these creatures of twilight and glamours, these clawed hands bearing nevermore and faerie fruit with their superstitious-like practices (e.g. having a necklace of dried rowan berries or wearing your stockings inside out) that are not simply superstitions, all serve to exceptionally bring this world into life and prove that world building is, indeed, Holly Black’s ultimate strength.In the end, readingThe Cruel Princewith its mythical magic and all the cruelties, deceptions, and (hypocritical) prejudice of its people, feels like wandering through a fairytale that chose the path on its left somewhere down the road, refusing to go right. And you bet I always choose the path on my left as well.✧ Companions ✧Book series playlist:Spotify URLBooks in series:➳ The Cruel Prince (The Folk of the Air, #1) ★★★★★➳The Lost Sisters(The Folk of the Air, #1.5) ★★★★☆➳The Wicked King(The Folk of the Air, #2) ★★★★★➳The Queen of Nothing(The Folk of the Air, #3) ★★★★☆➳How the King of Elfhame Learned to Hate Stories(The Folk of the Air, #3.5) ☆☆☆☆☆",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26032825-the-cruel-prince,The Cruel Prince.txt
Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children,"My grandfather had described it a hundred times, but in his stories the house was always a bright, happy place—big and rambling, yes, but full of light and laughter. What stood before me now was no refuge from monsters, but a monster itself, staring down from its perch on the hill with vacant hunger. Trees burst forth from broken windows and skins of scabrous vine gnawed at the walls like antibodies attacking a virus—as if nature itself had waged war against it—but the house seemed unkillable, resolutely upright despite the wrongness of its angles and the jagged teeth of sky visible through sections of collapsed roof.Jacob Porter (I leave out his middle name, which you can enjoy discovering on your own) had been enthralled by his grandfather Abe’s magical, if frightening, tales of his past, horrifying monsters in pursuit and a safe haven of a special school in Wales for those fortunate enough to escape. When being the brunt of derision at school was too much, Jacob cast aside his faith in his grandfather’s stories, and assumed the consensus view that Gramps had been speaking metaphorically, about having been chased out of Poland by the Nazis. But when Jacob is a teen, and his grandfather is brutally murdered, he has cause to reconsider.Ransom Riggs- from The Columbus DispatchThere is something both appealing and frightening about old photographs. In our apartment when I was a kid we had a book with photos from the Civil War. The pages were in less than pristine shape, but there were occasional pages that were well preserved, and on which the images were clear. It seemed impossible that people who had lived almost a hundred years before could seem so real, even in black and white, as if they might step out of the pages into our living room. It was similar in seeing photographs of my parents and their seldom, if ever, seen relations. I only knew my parents as middle-aged or elderly. Photos of them as young seemed, somehow, unreal. Nah, they never looked likethat. I often wondered who the imposter was in a photo that was supposed to be my father, in full work gear, in front of a locomotive, sans moustache. Was he really my father, and if he was, who was that guy falling asleep in the recliner in the living room?Emma Bloomfrom The Peculiar Children WikiaThe offbeat collection of fascinating photographs included in the book is one of the things that makes this book stand out. Ransom Riggs, the author ofMiss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children, has a peculiar affinity for old photographs. He had originally intended to collect them into a picture book, but was encouraged to expand on what he had and make a novel out of them. He did, amassing quite the collection, trolling estate and yard sales broadening his scope and finding unexpected notions and plot direction from the new collections. He particularly enjoyed spotting photos that were odd. One appears to show a girl floating above the ground, another an invisible person in a suit, another a young man covered in bees. The book contains about fifty of these images. They lend both a sense of antiquity and strangeness. Many are downright creepy. And that is a good, sometimes a wonderful thing, particularly when the images relate to the darker elements in the story. Riggs selected a lineup of these oddities and from them constructed a tale, an explanation for what the photos purport to show. The result is magical, a triumph of imagination, and a rip-roaring read.It was just a casual hobby, nothing serious, but I noticed that among the photos I found, the strangest and most intriguing ones were always of children. I began to wonder who some of these strange-looking children had been—what their stories were—but the photos were old and anonymous and there was no way to know. So I thought: If I can’t know their real stories, I’ll make them up…Sometimes I’d find a new photo that just demanded to be included in the story, and I’d find a way to work it in; other times I’d look for a certain type of photo to fit a story idea.When he begins to dig into the meaning behind a letter his grandfather had left him, Jacob begins on the road to discovery. He must figure out what the words in grandfather’s letter mean. His quest leads him, accompanied by his amateur ornithologist father, to an island off the coast of Wales. I am not giving anything away by letting you know that on this island he finds a very special place and some very special people.Miss Peregrinefrom The Peculiar Children WikiaI had inconsistent reactions to the book. At first, I was smitten. What a great idea! How beautifully realized! It offered the same sort of tingle I had when reading the first Harry Potter. Later, I felt that the story-telling relied on too many tropes. Oddities-thrown-together-to-cope-in-a-hostile-world, for example. It is no stretch to see close links to, say, X-men, or The Harry Potter series, or even, in a more adult realm, the sideshow performers ofGeek Love. There is the portal to another place. Think the wardrobe of Narnia fame or John Carter finding a magical route toBarsoom. Stargates and wormholes are rampant in sci-fi, as are parallel dimension tales, (The Matrixseries pops to mind) and there is always the familiar story of oneDorothy Galeto show the way as well. So, a well-worn path.On the other hand, writers use tropes because they serve a story-telling purpose. What matters more is whether they use well the familiar tools at hand. And they are handled pretty well here. Jacob is a sympathetic lead. Peregrine is a familiar person in charge, the type who is courageous and caring, despite what can seem a severe façade. The crew of peculiars is perfectly fine. And Riggs has come up with a particularly nifty explanation and form for hisotherworld.What Jacob findsStepping from one world into another, particularly for teens, is usually about leaving the nest and seeing the real world for the first time, whether this is about sexuality, fairness, conflict, truth, or all of the above. Growing up,coming of age. Jacob’s hormones are stretched a bit here, so we can check that box. Also he gets to see some of the reality of what his life pre-Peregrine featured. What were the adults in his life really like when seen through his newly acquired perspective? Can our character grow sufficiently to take on adult responsibilities, make adult decisions? You betcha.InA Conversation with Ransom Riggs, an extra section at the back of myPeregrinevolume, Riggs saysOne of the themes ofMiss Peregrine, and I think of any novel that involves the discovery of a secret world, is awakening—the protagonist’s awakening to an awesome and wonderful and, in some ways, terrible reality he scarcely could have imagined before, but that was right under his nose all along. At the end ofMiss Peregrine, Jacob writes that his life was never ordinary, but he “had simply failed to notice how extraordinary it was.” Noticing the extraordinariness of the world is one of Emerson’s major themes. Again, from Nature: “If the stars should appear one night in a thousand years, how would men believe and adore, and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of God which had been shown.Emerson (Ralph Waldo, notKeith) is referenced several times here. In fact Emerson was much more in the book in earlier versions, according to the afterward in the volume I read. Riggs saysEmerson often speaks of the possibility of fantastic things that exist just out of view, and many of his most famous quotes almost seem to refer directly to the peculiar children.He offers a mystery, and the clues that Jacob and the reader are challenged to interpret in order to figure out what is going on. And there is magic. The powers of the peculiar children are certainly fun, but not spectacular, overall. A bit of fire control, levitation, super strength, invisibility. A few stand out. One boy has a close relationship with the apian world. Another has a gift for animating the inanimate. A girl can make plants grow very, very fast. One girl has an unexpected way of eating. And, of course, Peregrine has a few nifty tricks up her wing.The underlying conflict, mirroring the war in the world when the school was founded, (WW II) offers some pretty scary baddies,wightsandhollowgasts, the origin story of which called to mind Tolkien’s Gollum. The ongoing fear, chase, and battle loop is fun, generating the needed tension and keeping things moving along.Peculiars- from the filmI did not like that dad was portrayed as a dimwit. Not that he needed to be heroic, but he seemed far too lacking in strength and perception for my taste. And then, there are the changes made for the film. This review was posted before the film was released, so I can refer only to what I have read, and not to what I have actually seen. I reserve the right to modify once I have seen the movie. I am not thrilled that the film conflates two girls into one. I do understand that changes are typically made when translating a book to the medium of film. My objection is a small one. And while I expect to quite enjoy the otherworldly looking and compelling Eva Green as Peregrine, I imagined an older bird in the role. Getting Tim Burton as director is an amazing coup. Whatever changes have been made, I expect the film to be enchanting and wonderfully entertaining.The author writes that this book, like the first Harry Potter, is meant to introduce his characters and his world to readers. It is in the second book in the series,Hollow City, that we can expect to enter that world and experience it more fully. I cannot speak to that one, as I have not yet read it. But I very much want to be kept in the loop for how this series unfolds.Peculiarmay not have quite the rich dazzle of the Harry Potter books, but that is a pretty high bar by which to measure any YA series. It is enough that the first one is a particularly fun hook, and a very enjoyable read, with engaging characters, a good bit of action, some mystery, some surprises and a lot of human, and maybe not-so-human, connection. I suppose the only thing that would really be peculiar would be if anyone was not interested in checking this out.Review first posted - 9/30/16Publication date – 6/7/11=============================EXTRA STUFFLinks to the author’spersonal,Twitter,Instagram, andFBpagesRiggs made the trailer for this, his first novel, after traveling to Belgium and Luxembourglooking for the ruined house of his imagination.

The Raven Boys,"”He felt raw: the chronicle of his fiercest desire stripped from him by force.”After finishing “The Raven Boys” I have about a thousand of questions, the most pressing one however is the following:Why did I wait so long to read this freaking awesome book???I mean seriously!!?? What’s wrong with me!?How could I survive without knowing about “The Raven Cycle”?!I loved this book! It was so magical and mysterious and all the characters were so unique and well developed! What I loved the most was the way they interacted though! Those four boys have such a deep friendship it’s almost unbelievable! They care so much for each other, yet they all have their own troubles and worries that constantly seem to get in their way! Each and every single one of them is somehow broken, but together they are whole! Gosh!! I can’t even describe how wonderful they are but suffice it to say that this book is going to turn your world upside down! ;-) Well, that and your emotions! Jeez! This was such a roller coaster my hair is still messy and tangled from the ride! *lol*I guess to know what I’m talking about you just have to read the book and make this experience for yourself. I’m pretty certain the majority of you won’t regret it and I can almost guarantee that sooner or later you will realise that you’ve grown fond of“The Raven Boys”as well! ;-P They just have a way to sneak into your heart and once you’ve opened up there is no going back! XDThe plot:”More than anything, the journal wanted. It wanted more than it could hold, more than words could describe, more than diagrams could illustrate. Longing burst from the pages, in every frantic line and every hectic sketch and every dark-printed definition. There was something pained and melancholy about it.”Blue Sargent is the daughter of a psychic and has grown up in a family that knows and sees things others don’t. Every member of her family has a special talent and so does Blue! She’s some sort of supernatural amplifier and is able to strengthen the abilities of others, yet she can’t use her gift to see ghosts as well. Well, at least not until the night of St. Marks Eve when she meets the ghost of a boy named Gansey. Apparently the only reason she’s able to see him is because he’s her true love and before she even knows it, Blue is already smack in the middle of a magical quest that drives her straight into the arms of a group of four Aglionby Boys. There are only two problems: First, Blue swore herself never to get involved with any of the Aglionby Boys and secondly, there’s a rather dark prophecy that claims that she’s going to cause the death of her true love…The characters:”But Gansey was already grabbing the car keys to the Pig and stepping around his miniature Henrietta. Even though Ronan was snarling and Noah was sighing and Adam was hesitating, he didn’t turn to verify that they were coming. He knew they were. In three different ways, he’d earned them all days or weeks or months before, and when it came to it, they’d all follow him anywhere.”This is the moment where I tell you that you’ll be hopelessly spoiled if you continue to read my review! So consider yourself warned and proceed at your own risk! ;-PGansey:”As always there was an all-American war hero look to him, coded in his tousled brown hair, his summer-narrowed hazel eyes, the straight nose that ancient Anglo-Saxons had graciously passed on to him. Everything about him suggested valor and power and a firm handshake.”Gansey is so precious!! He is some sort of mother hen and cares for all of his boys and I just couldn’t help but had to love him for it! Alone the way he expressed himself, how he spoke, what he thought and his journal, gosh how much I adored him for writing his journal!!! This boy is pure poetry and whenever I read his POV I was so intrigued that I just wanted to read even more! XD I loved how he worried about Adam, Ronan and Noah, how he knew that he appeared to be arrogant but still couldn’t seem to be able to change it. Oh, how he broke my heart! And then his story about the hornets’ nest!? Gosh it gave me the creeps!! I’m allergic to bees and wasps as well and when I was about eight years old I made a rather similar experience. *shudders* THIS hit way too close to home and I actually had to stop to read when he told his story! ARGH! I’m getting goose bumps just thinking about it! *lol* I really don’t know how he’s going to deal with Adam’s betrayal and I can’t wait to find out in the next book! I just hope their relationship isn’t broken because of it!!”Adam was struck, as he occasionally was, by Gansey’s agelessness: an old man in a young body, or a young man in an old man’s life.””In the end, he was nobody to Adam, he was nobody to Ronan. Adam spit his words back at him and Ronan squandered however many second chances he gave him. Gansey was just a guy with a lot of stuff and a hole inside him that chewed away more of his heart every year.""”My words are unerring tools of destruction, and I’ve come unequipped with the ability to disarm them. Can you believe I’m only alive because Noah died? What a fine sacrifice that was, what a fine contribution to the world I am.”Blue:I really liked Blue! She was so nice and kind and even though everyone told her to stay away from the boy’s she was just too curious to actually go through with it! *lol* I loved that she always tried to see the good in those four boys, especially Ronan! ;-P And it was sooo damn sweet how she interacted with Noah!!! =))) Those two were amazing! *lol* Whenever Noah patted her head I was like: Awww!I think I kind of low-key ship them even though I know that this is never going to happen! Haha! I’m really curious how Blue’s character is going to develop and I can’t wait to get to know her even better!Adam:”Unlike Ronan, Adam’s Aglionby sweater was secondhand, but he’d taken great care to be certain it was impeccable. He was slim and tall, with dusty hair unevenly cropped above a fineboned, tanned face. He was a sepia photograph.Oh, Adam!!! He’s such a precious cinnamon roll!!! I love this boy and I’m so sorry that he had to endure the abuse of his father!! How could he dare to hurt my precious boy so much??!! I could understand why Adam wanted to be independent and didn’t want to rely on Gansey! He wanted to do things his way and I respect that! Still, sometimes he was a little bit too stubborn for his own good and I really wish he would have accepted Gansey’s offer to live with him! I can’t bear the thought that he’ll never be able to hear on his left ear again and gosh I’m so glad Ronan came to his rescue and intervened!!! XD I think of all the characters in this book, Adam actually went through the biggest character development and I really hope that he’s going to be okay in the next book! I know why he woke the lay line but I’m worried about the price he’ll have to pay! >_<”The ripped knees of Adam’s camo cargo pants appeared first, then his faded Coca-Cola T-shirt, then, finally, his face. A bruise spread over his cheekbone, red and swelling as a galaxy. A darker one snaked over the bridge of his nose.Gansey said immediately, “You’re leaving with me.””It means I never get to be my own person. If I let you cover for me, then I’m yours. I’m his now, and then I’ll be yours.””Where do you live?”Adam’s mouth was very set. “A place made for leaving.”“That’s not really an answer.”“It’s not really a place.”Ronan:”Gansey had once told Adam that he was afraid most people didn’t know how to handle Ronan. What he meant by this was that he was worried that one day someone would fall on Ronan and cut themselves.”Well if that quote doesn’t describe Ronan perfectly then I really don’t know! XD Oh, man! That boy was so awesome! XD I loved his grumpiness and his attitude! Despite his rather mean and very honest statements he seemed to have a pretty soft side and even though it was hidden so well, there were still some moments when you could see it! =) I wish we would have gotten his POV as well, but I guess Maggie had her reasons to hold it back! Hopefully we’ll get Ronan’s POV in the second book though and if “yes”, you’ll certainly read it in my updates. *LOL* I’m curious to find out more about his background and I really want to know why he and his brother are at odds! AND what happened to his father?!! This question is still playing on my mind and I can’t help but wonder what happened when he found him!”Ronan kept staring at Whelk. He was good at staring. There was something about his stare that took something from the other person.””You look like a super villain with your familiar,” Adam said.Ronan’s smile cut his face, but he looked kinder than Blue had ever seen him, like the raven in his hand was his heart, finally laid bare.Noah:”Noah, unlike his pristine room, always seemed a little grubby. There was something out of place about his clothing, his mostly combed-back fair hair. His unkempt uniform always made Adam feel a little less like he stuck out.”I’m so sorry that he’s a ghost! I already anticipated it because I picked up on the clues, but I really wish my perceptive mind would have been wrong! *sighs* I never liked Whelk and I can’t understand how he could kill such a nice and cute boy!! I mean he was his friend!!! Poor Noah! To be betrayed like that! Still, I’m glad they managed to get his bones to the church and I hope he’s going to be a permanent part of the next three books! =)”I’ve been dead for seven years,” Noah said. “That’s as warm as they get.””Can we go home? This place is so creepy.”The ships:Gansey & Blue:He paused, his smile wide and benevolent. “This is all down to you. Putting us on the line, finally. I could kiss you.”Though he was obviously joking, Blue skittered to the side.I loved those two right from the beginning! They have such a nice chemistry and I can’t wait to see how they’ll fall in love! Right now it doesn’t seem to be likely, but we all read about Blue’s vision in the tree and I have no doubt that they’ll actually end up together! I guess I’ll just have to wait and see what Maggie Stiefvater has up her sleeve! *lol* ;-PRonan & Adam:Adam and Blue Who? *looks innocent*Ronan said, “I’m always straight.”Adam replied, “Oh, man, that’s the biggest lie you’ve ever told.”I know this is no official shipBUTI WILL GO DOWN WITH THIS SHIP!!!! I swear there were so many moments between Adam and Ronan and if they don’t get together in one of those four books I’m going to cry a freaking ocean!! I mean it!!! I’ll die if Maggie Stiefvater doesn’t work her magic with those two!!! THEY JUST HAVE TO BECOME CANON!!! Period!!! Enough said! XD *faints*”As Adam stared at his lap, penitent, he mused that there was something musical about Ronan when he swore, a careful and loving precision to the way he fit the words together, a black-painted poetry.””He stroked Chainsaw’s head with a single finger and she tilted her beak up in response. It was a strange moment in a strange evening, and if it had happened the day before, it would’ve struck Adam that he rarely saw such thoughtless kindness from Ronan.”Artist credit: ranoki @ tumblrThe bottom line:I LOVED THIS BOOK!!! I loved it with all my heart and all my being!!!Maggie Stiefvater is a genius and I can’t wait to dig my claws into the next book!! XD“The Dream Thieves” I’m coming!!!P.S: Before I forget: This was a buddy read with the amazing Katherine and I’m so glad we could experience this together!!! You were the perfect buddy to read this book! ;-)",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17675462-the-raven-boys,The Raven Boys.txt
"The Hobbit, or There and Back Again","“In a city, in an English university town, there lived a don. Not a sprawling, grimy slum of a city, full of the stench of neglect and despair, nor yet a soulless prosperous city, fueled by commercial enterprise: it was an Oxford professor's hometown, and that means intellectual satisfaction.”If this rather feeble skit is instantly recognisable to you, just pause for a moment, to marvel at how much impact the original opening lines ofThe Hobbithave had. They have been incredibly successful at seeping their way into the general consciousness. In fact it could be said that this simple children's novel is responsible for triggering an entire canon of modern English Fantasy - quite an accomplishment for a quiet professor of Anglo-Saxon.Without Tolkien'sThe Hobbit, we would not have such well-formed and specific ideas of elves, dwarves, goblins, wizards, dragons and trolls. Plus, of course, his invented orcs (goblins), hobbits and wargs, and also the wonderful prehistoric era of Middle-earth (a Middle English name) which he invented for our world, would simply not exist. And even this is not the whole of it. Tolkien was responsible not only for our current ideas of many creatures of fantasy, and a whole other world. He created more than a hundred drawings to support the story. In addition he created a new ""Elvish"" language with an invented script, and also made a few changes to our own. Tolkien felt that ""dwarfs"", the plural of dwarf (a plural which had formerly been drummed into every English schoolchild of the last century) was not logical. He insisted on using an incorrect form,""dwarves"", rather than treating it as an irregular plural. His persistence succeeded. Nowadays it is common to find the plural written Tolkien's way.For the last few decades one of the highest accolades given to a new fantasy novel has been that it is Tolkien-esque. Scores of novels apparently have born comparison with the master, even more so if they are trilogies, and about a quest. Potential readers routinely used to look in the front ""to see if it had a map in it"". It could be said that this one novel kick-started, defined and inspired an entire tradition of modern fantasy. Yet it is a simple children's adventure story - isn't it?J.R.R. Tolkien was not an average children's writer. Nor was he given to writing blockbusters. On the contrary, he was a shy academic, who lived quietly with his wife and four children in North Oxford. He had an impressive record of scholarly achievements, and was a Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford University. He specialised in Old and Middle English, teaching undergraduates. The only indication of Tolkien's story-telling abilities was that he told them bedtime stories, and more unusually, he wrote illustrated letters to them ""from Santa Claus"" every Christmas. (These were later published in 1976 as""The Father Christmas Letters"", along with other early children's books he wrote specifically for his own children.)Tolkien had long been fascinated by both language and mythology. His first job had been as a lexicographer, in the course of which he helped to draft the Oxford English Dictionary. During this time he began to invent languages based on Finnish and Welsh, which he imagined might have been spoken by elves. He also began writing stories which incorporated this ""Elvish"" language, inventing a whole new mythology. He called his stories""Lost Tales"".The other part of the jigsaw comes in the form of Tolkien's social life. He became a founding member of a group of Oxford friends who had similar interests. They called themselves,""The Inklings"", a name which suggesting writing, and sounded vaguely Anglo-Saxon.""The Inklings""met for conversation and drinks, discussing religion and reading to each other from their works in progress. Tolkien was a devout Catholic, and he felt that mythology had an important role in conveying both moral and spiritual values. Incidentally, C. S. Lewis was another prominent member. He was one of Tolkien's closest friends, and an agnostic at the time. He argued against this idea, dismissing myths and fairy tales. The scene was set.By Tolkien's own account, he was routinely marking his students' exam papers, his mind possibly wandering elsewhere, and he came across a page of an answer-book which one student had left blank. In a frivolous moment, bored and feeling whimsical, he wrote,""In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.""Tolkien then became intrigued by his own daydream of an idea, deciding that he needed to find out what a hobbit was, and what sort of a hole it might live in, and so on. He began to write a story which he told to his younger children, and began to pass around his friends at""The Inklings""gatherings. It eventually found its way to a publishing house,""George Allen and Unwin"", and was pronounced as a good read by the Chairman's 10 year old son, who wrote a report about it for his father. It was then published in 1937, was immediately successful, and has been popular ever since.Not surprisingly, the publishers asked Tolkien if he had anything similar to publish. Tolkien offered them what we now know as""The Silmarillion"", but of course this was not at all similar, and the publishers' readers decided that it would not be a commercial success. The publishers therefore declined the material, but asked Tolkien if he could write a sequel. And the rest, as they say, is history, for the ""sequel"" was the magnificent trilogy,""The Lord of the Rings"". The course of the next few years - the development of a mammoth opus inspired by ancient European myths, with its own maps, mythology, languages and lore - was neither easy not straightforward. Tolkien often interrupted the writing of his story to iron out a linguistic problem or an historical inconsistency. However, eventually,""The Lord of the Rings""was published in three parts,""The Fellowship of the Ring""during 1954 and""The Two Towers""and""The Return of the King""in 1955. The story follows on fromThe Hobbit, including many of the original characters such as Gandalf the Wizard, but also inventing and introducing dozens of new ones, and a new ""hero"" hobbit, a distant younger cousin (and heir) of Bilbo's, Frodo. Its tone is also very different. Although it is said that Tolkien protested thatThe Hobbitwas not meant to be a children's book, it has the light jokey feel of one, whereas""The Lord of the Rings""is darker throughout.So what is it exactly in a simple children's story which so captured the public's imagination, leading to the phenomenon we know as""The Lord of the Rings""? FirstThe Hobbitis a story of a quest, one of the most ancient traditional stories in history. It is a story of a journey involving travel, in which the hero returns home with the object of his quest. The theme would have been a well-loved one to Tolkien, who was steeped in Old and Middle English poetry, and in Greek and Norse myth. Shortly before writingThe Hobbithe had published a scholarly essay on the Old English epic poem,""Beowulf"". In 1925 he had edited the Middle English poem""Sir Gawain and the Green Knight"", the Arthurian legend of the Holy Grail. And of course readers ofThe Hobbitwill rememberthat it is a cup which Bilbo steals from the dragon Smaug's hoard.Bilbo the hobbit's journey is through lands strange to him, and very distant from The Shire, through Mirkwood and the Misty Mountains to the Lonely Mountain. It is a perilous journey, with plenty of suspense and threat. He forms close friendships with the dwarves, and all of them suffer along the way, and risk deathin the culminating Battle of the Five Armies on the Lonely Mountain.Of course such a quest is a test of character and inner strength, and so this one proves to be. Bilbo grows both in courage and - by using his brain - in his personal integrity. We see that for much of the journey, he regrets his decision to join the dwarves, daydreaming about the comforts of his own home,“It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort”He misses his solitary pleasures, such as his traditional breakfast of bacon and eggs, and he misses his pipe full of tobacco. The dramatic adventures they are all having are not at all attractive to him. As he had said to Gandalf earlier,“We are plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures. Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner!”and,“We don't want any adventures here! You might try over the Hill or Across the Water.”In this way the quest is a metaphor for the fulfilment of both Bilbo's personal growth and his destiny. Each episode and encounter allow him different ways of responding; they serve as trials and lessons to him, in his own journey through life. As the story develops, Bilbo learns to use his intelligence, imagination, resourcefulness and courage. He increases in confidence, wisdom and power, developing personal authority. For instancehe kills the spiders, and rescues the dwarves from the dungeon of the Elvenking. Later, on his own initiative, he makes the bold and risky decision to take the Arkenstone to Bard, in an attempt to prevent a war over the treasure which the dragon Smaug is holding. The reader of any age likes to identify with the hero, an ordinary character in an extraordinary situation. Bilbo is keen to do good, for instance when he does not kill Gollum, even though he could easily use the advantage of his invisibility, and his sword, to help him.And it has to be said that the Bilbo of the novels is very childlike, in the way he is viewed, both by the other characters and by the reader. We have an impression of a short, small, young (for a hobbit) only partly developed character. One whose behaviour has many similarities with a child's. At any rate, a child would have no difficulty about empathising with Bilbo, yet at the same time appreciating that he is a funny sort of old-fashioned, eccentric and pompous personage,“Already he was a very different hobbit from the one that had run out without a pocket-handkerchief from Bag-End long ago. He had not had a pocket-handkerchief for ages.”Bilbo has a strong sense of right and wrong. He is indignant that the dwarves have had their gold stolen, and saddened that the town of Dale is in ruins. The novel describes many stretches of bleak landscape on the way to the Lonely Mountain; desolate places where nothing can grow. Part of Bilbo's quest is to somehow put this right.His enemies are Smaug and to a lesser extent Gollum, although he sees that Gollum is also to be pitied. Both of them would rather kill than share what they are in possession of. There are echoes throughoutThe Hobbitof this disapproval of acquisitiveness; a clear message that overconcern for material wealth is corrupting. The Master of Lake-town will not use his wealth to rebuild the town devastated by Smaug, so eventually he loses power to be replaced by the fairer man, Bard, who earlier had killed Smaug. The dwarves seem at their weakest and least clear-thinking when they are greedy for gold. Even Thorin's death could be understood in a sense to be a consequence of him being the most prone to the""dragon-sickness""or in other words, the lust for gold, in starting off the revenge journey in the first place.By the end of the novel Bilbo has changed, because of what he has experienced and whom he has encountered. As we expect from a children's tale, though, it has not been a truly life-changing experience for him. He has merely discovered a new and individual side to his character, in that he is more like his adventurous Took relatives on his mother's side, than the rather staid Baggins side whom he resembled at the start of the novel,“The Bagginses had lived in the neighbourhood of The Hill for time out of mind, and people considered them very respectable, not only because most of them were rich, but also because they never had any adventures or did anything unexpected: you could tell what a Baggins would say on any question without the bother of asking him.”The reader can see that a humorous attitude such as this, from near the beginning of the novel,“The washing-up was so dismally real that Bilbo was forced to believe the party of the night before had not been part of his bad dreams, as he had rather hoped”could equally well be held by the Bilbo of the end of the novel.The Hobbitis an extraordinary creation. Tolkien combined the ancient heroic Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian epics he knew so well, with the middle-class rural England in which he lived. He himself admitted that Bilbo Baggins was based on the rural Englishmen of his own time. To transpose a rural Englishman of the 1930's into an heroic setting, describing the ensuing adventures with gentle comedy and whimsical charm, made for an immediate success. The way it is told is, strangely, even now not particularly dated. Tolkien gives us a lot of information about the lifestyle of hobbits, the ancient history of dwarves and elves, and even about runes. It is clear that the narrator knows everything, knows what will happen in the future of the story. The narrator frequently hints at - or even refers to - other episodes in the story, and what will happen to the characters. But all this information is imparted in an entertaining rather than a boring instructive way. The novel’s playful jocular tone and imagery continues to appeal both to children and adults. Tolkien uses a chatty voice throughout inThe Hobbit, sounding as if he is sitting next to you telling you the story personally. For instance when he states Bilbo's greeting,“I am just about to take tea; pray come and have some with me”he then goes on to comment on it chattily,“A little stiff perhaps, but he meant it kindly. And what would you do, if an uninvited dwarf came and hung his things up in your hall without a word of explanation?”Later on in identifying the wood-elves, he comments that“of course”that is what they are. He talks directly to the reader, using the word“you”in the manner of much earlier novelists. He also treads a very fine line between what might be regarded as “twee” or cosy, and what comes across as merely comic and amusing. The dwarves are clearly figures of fun,“there was a very old-looking dwarf on the step with a white beard and a scarlet hood; and he too hopped inside as soon as the door was open, just as if he had been invited. “I see they have begun to arrive already,” he said when he caught sight of Dwalin’s green hood hanging up. He hung his red one next to it, and “Balin at your service!” he said with his hand on his breast.”Yet oddly the reader can believe totally in their strength, loyalty and courage. Not only do elves, dwarves, goblins and trolls differ from one another in their physical and psychological attributes, but Tolkien represents all these different types of fantasy characters as each having an inherent morality. For instance, all the elves are good, and all the goblins are bad. The good fantasy creatures are portrayed as being in harmony with nature, while the evil ones are depicted as being at odds with it. So the eagles decide to side with the elves, who are on the side of nature, and help them to defeat the evil goblins or orcs.Tolkien reveals many of his own personal attitudes and opinions inThe Hobbit, and one example is clearly indicatedin Thorin's final words. One might expect an heroic or pompous statement, as Thorin throughout has been depicted as one who has a rather pompous and self-important streak in him.Yet his final words to Bilbo are not heroic or grand. They are wise, but not epic. They are not ancient, but modern. They echo the simplicity of the hobbits' own values,“If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.”J.R.R. Tolkien has never been fully accepted by the English Literary establishment, some of whom have condemned both his books and all the following influenced fiction. But Tolkien remains loved by millions of readers worldwide. His books are global best sellers, and adaptations abound. Fans form Tolkien clubs, learning his fictional languages, and indulging in all thing Tolkienian.Perhaps it is necessary, as a final word, to say a little about the recent famous adaptation ofThe Hobbitinto a trio of films by the director Peter Jackson. They too are astounding achievements, clearly a loving tribute by a talented admirer of Tolkien's works. Many people may now come to the novel after seeing these films. Out all the adaptations I know, they stand alone. I went to see the first part, for instance, five times in the cinema, despite not usually watching any film there more than once. But ...All three films are really only loosely based onThe Hobbit. Much of the dialogue is there, but also there are many discrepancies. Jackson's humour is not Tolkien's. His vision of the characters - especially the comic dwarves - differs. He takes liberties with the plot, changing both histories and current events. He adds characters. He amplifies both from other parts of Tolkien's works and also from his own imagination. My personal opinion is that the films are excellent, but different. And if you have such a respect for Tolkien's vision that you cannot bear for it to be altered in any way, then you may not enjoy them.The original novel however, is in a class of its own. It is unique and groundbreaking. And still remains a lot of fun to read.In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.“I suppose hobbits need some description nowadays, since they have become rare and shy of the Big People, as they call us. They are (or were) a little people, about half our height, and smaller than the bearded dwarves. Hobbit have no beards. There is little or no magic about them, except the ordinary everyday sort which helps them to disappear quickly when large stupid folk like you and me come blundering along, making a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile off. They are inclined to be fat in the stomach; they dress in bright colours (chiefly green and yellow) wear no shoes because their feet grow natural leathery soles and thick warm brown hair like the stuff on their heads (which is curly); have long clever brown fingers, good-natured faces, and laugh deep fruity laughs (especially after dinner, which they have twice a day when they can get it.)”",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5907.The_Hobbit_or_There_and_Back_Again,"The Hobbit, or There and Back Again.txt"
Shadow and Bone,"”I’ve been waiting for you a long time, Alina,” he said. “You and I are going to change the world.”Leigh’s cooking receipt for“Shadow and Bone”:1 naïve and rather plain looking heroine1 handsome childhood friend1 dark, mysterious and irresistible villain1 close friend that’s kind of an outsider as wellA pinch of magicA hint of insecurityA handful of unexpected eventsAnd half a teaspoon of scheming and betrayalTo get the full effect you have to mix up all the ingredients and let the dough rise for at least half an hour. Well and then you just mix it all again! *lol*Et voila! Now you have a book with all the typical young adult tropes that somehow managed to take a different kind of turn than you initially expected. ;-PI swear some of the things Leigh wrote were even a surprise for such a long-established Young Adult fan like myself. Haha! She’s a clever woman, I have to give her that! XDThe characters:The Darkling is known for his swoon-worthy Darkness, I’m known for my spoilery characters section! Guess we all have our talents. ;-P Anyway, if you don’t want to read any spoilers you better click that nice exit button now. ;-P Otherwise you’ll enter the Fold and no matter if you’ve read the book or not, it’s usually a place of no return. XDAlina:”I guess you only look like a mouse,” he whispered in my ear, and then beckoned to one of his personal guard.”I liked Alina, but she didn’t sweep me off my feet. I mean she’s basically your typical Young Adult heroine: orphan, plain looking, stubborn, kind, powerful and very, very naïve. *lol* So yeah, she was as likable as they come, but I didn’t really have hearty-eyes when I read about her. I’m pretty sure she’s going to be on guard after the events of book one and I can’t help but wonder what’s going to happen in the next book. There are definitely a lot of possibilities and I’m looking forward to read about her character development. Because , yes, there will be a lot of character development ahead of her and I hope it’s going to make her interesting. I mean, no YA heroine ever started out with a fully developed character so I guess we’ll have to see what Leigh has in store for us! ;-)The Darkling:”He had a sharp, beautiful face, a shock of thick black hair, and clear gray eyes that glimmered like quartz.”I finally met the infamous Darkling!!!YESH!!! *runs around hyper*And he’s as amazing as I thought he’d be!!! I love this dark, mysterious, broody, intriguing and sexy guy! XD And I sooo wasn’t surprised that he’s the villain. I mean come on, Alina!!! He’s named“The Darkling”for a reason!!! I can’t believe she was so naïve. *lol* Well anyway, where were we? Yes, the Darkling! XD I love him to bits and pieces. He’s everything I need a villain to be: cruel, cunning, calculating, ambitious, ruthless and misguided. XD Not to mention so swoon-worthy that I had a hard time to concentrate whenever I read one of his scenes. *lol* So yeah, I’m a fan of the Darkling now and I’m not ashamed!!! <333 Can’t wait to find out what he’s going to do in the next two books! =))”I’m not used to people trying to kill me.”“Really? I hardly notice anymore.””I hope you don’t expect fairness from me, Alina. It isn’t one of my specialities.””He sounded so sincere, so reasonable, less a creature of relentless ambition than a man who believed he was doing the right thing for his people. Despite all he’d done and all he intended, I did almost believe him. Almost.”Mal:”I’ve risked my life for you. I’ve walked half the length of Ravka for you, and I’d do it again and again and again just to be with you, just to starve with you and freeze with you and hear you complain about hard cheese every day. So don’t tell me we don’t belong together,” he said fiercely. He was very close now, and my heart was suddenly hammering in my chest. “I’m sorry it took me so long to see you, Alina. But I see you now.”I don’t get why so many people hate Mal. I mean he’s actually kinda cute! I didn’t like Kilorn in “Red Queen” and I usually tend to dislike the “handsome childhood friends” in YA books but I really ended up liking Mal. He’s nice and caring and he’s a loyal friend of Alina. Plus he’s not as annoying as they usually are! Mal was a nice counterweight to Alina, he always thought ahead was reasonable, knew his limits and seemed to be a rather laid-back guy. So why all the hate?! Is he doing something bad in the next two books?! I don’t understand all the annoyed updates I read about him, because I think he’s a decent love interest and I really like him. XDGenya:”You should be used to being gawked at by now.”“And yet I’m not.”“Well, if it gets too bad, give me a signal, and I’ll get up on the banquet table, toss my skirt over my head, and do a little dance. That way no one will be looking at you.”Aww I loved Genya so damn much!! <333 She’s such an amazing woman and I really hope that she’ll end up on Alina’s side in the next book. I know why she had to support the Darkling and why she didn’t dare to act against his wishes and I feel really sorry for her. I wish there would have been more scenes with my precious girl but since she was only a side character in the first book her appearances were rather limited. Still, she swept me off my feet and I hope to see her again! There’s still so much I don’t know about her and I really want to meet her again! Hopefully under better circumstances this second time around. =)Nikolai:”What about the other one?” I asked I knew the King and Queen had a younger son, but I’d never actually seen him.“Sobachka?”“You can’t call a royal prince ‘puppy,’ “ I laughed.Soo, can anyone explain why Nikolai is called “Sobachka”? *lol* I thought I’d get to know him in this book but all I got were a few little hints that only made me even more curious. Guess he’s going to make his entrance in the next book?! I’m soo damn curious you have no idea!!! XDBaghra:”It isn’t an animal that shies away from you or chooses whether or not to come when you call it. Do you ask your heart to beat or your lungs to breathe? Your power serves you because that is its purpose, because it cannot help but serve you.”Ohh Baghra certainly was an interesting character. For one thing she wasn’t just Alina’s cruel and relentless instructor but also the Darkling’s mother! Yes, you read right! His freaking mother!!! *LOL* Leigh, you did something amazing there!!! I mean how many YA and fantasy books did I read?! Too many to count, but the villain never ever had a mom! XD Well, in this trilogy he has one and she’s not happy with her son! Haha! I just loved this!!! Thank you Leigh, this was truly amazing! <333The Ships:Alina & The Darkling:”The problem with wanting,” he whispered, his mouth trailing along my jaw until it hovered over my lips, “is that it makes us weak.”They had some sizzling chemistry that’s for sure!! I loved it when the Darkling did his best to seduce Alina and in all honesty I definitely wouldn’t have been as restrained as her. *lol* I really don’t know how she even managed to contain herself. I got weak knees just reading about him and I admire Alina for not throwing herself at him. Haha! I doubt I’d have had that strength. I guess their ship sunk and ended up being shipwrecked in the end though. Pity, I certainly would have loved to read more of those intense and hot scenes. ;-P”So you do make mistakes,” I said without thinking.He paused in the act of pulling on his gloves, and I pressed my lips together nervously. “I didn’t mean –““Of course I make mistakes,” he said. His mouth curved into a half smile. “Just not often.”Alina & Mal:”Look at me.” I willed myself to raise my eyes to his. “I know you’re scared. I am, too. But we’re going to do this, and we’re going to be fine. We always are. Okay?”I loved their strong friendship and I lived for their easy banter. They knew each other inside out and it was refreshing to see that the “handsome childhood bestie” trope worked out nicely for once. In all the other YA books the childhood friend always ends up being scorned, not in this one! Leigh actually managed to pull it off to give them a good and solid basis for a strong relationship. =) Which is a first! I never read a YA book in which the best friend actually ended up being the main love interest. So, Queen Leigh, you have all my respect!! *bows* I’m not sure if it will stay that way and if they’ll still be together at the end of the last book, but I have hope for them and this is more than I had for other YA bestie couples. XDHe swallowed, and I could see him struggle with the knowledge, but all he said was, “All right.”I let out a sound that was half laugh, half sob. “Only you could contemplate imminent death and just say ‘all right.’ “He smiled at me and pushed the hair back from my tear-stained face. “How about ‘oh no’?”Conclusion:I really enjoyed“Shadow and Bone”and I was so curious how it would continue that I already started with the second book. I usually don’t start with the next book until I wrote a proper review for the first one so that should tell you enough about how desperately I wanted to read on. *lol*So yeah, if you’re a sucker for YA tropes and want to see how they can be written in unexpected ways, I highly recommend you to read this book! You won’t be disappointed! Queen Leigh knows her stuff! ;-P",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37834723-shadow-and-bone,Shadow and Bone.txt
Six of Crows,"How to begin this review?How to put into words how much I loved these characters and this book?How am I supposed to write down all those many feels?And most importantly,How can I live with this ache in my chest?I have no answer to all of those questions, but I know that I have to write this review!So here I go!Let’s hope my voice doesn’t falter and pray that my words don’t fail.“The heart is an arrow. It demands aim to land true.”When I first read about“Six of Crows”I thought that it would be a fun read. You know one of those books that are easy to read and make you laugh. I expected to read a story that was able to enthral me. A story I would enjoy and classify as intriguing.“Six of Crows” was all of that and yet it was so much more!!!I was not prepared to fall in love with all of those beautiful characters and I certainly didn’t expect to be so affected by their lives and background stories. Every single one of those six individuals touched my heart and I know that “Six of Crows” actually is supposed to be a story about a dangerous heist and an adventure. To me it was so much more than that though. It was a story about life and hate and the choices that we make. It was a tale about the people and experiences that shape us. But most of all it actually was a secret and subtle homage to love.I can’t even put into words how much Leigh Bardugo’s book moved me, but I can tell you that “Six of Crows” is brilliantly written and left me longing for more!Now that I got this off my chest I’m finally able to write the actual review and since you all know me you also know what to expect. ;-)The plot:Kaz Brekker is the right-hand man of the leader of the Dregs, one of the many gangs that live in the Barrel territory of Ketterdam and try their best to get by. One day a merchant named Van Eck offers him an obscene amount of money he can’t refuse and this is exactly the moment when everything gets into motion. To get this job done Kaz has to hire the best crew the Barrel has to offer and since they aren’t only supposed to break into the Ice Court but also aim to save a hostage, they actually got a lot of trouble ahead of them.This is the moment where I take the liberty to inform you that the characters section is going to be full of spoilers. So yeah, tread carefully and don’t say I didn’t warn you. ;-PThe characters:And yet they hesitated. The knowledge that they might never see each other again, that some of them – maybe all of them – might not survive this night hung heavy in the air. A gambler, a convict, a wayward son, a lost Grisha, a Suli girl who had become a killer, a boy from the Barrel who had become something worse.Kaz:Kaz shook his head, dark hair glinting in the lamplight. He was a collection of hard lines and tailored edges – sharp jaw, lean build, wool coat snug across his shoulders.”He is the brilliant leader of the crew and also known as “Dirtyhands” or “The bastard of the Barrel”! After reading the second chapter I was already in love with his sharp and intriguing mind and damn me but that boy’s intelligence is hot as hell!!! XD Alone his scheming face! *lol* I love characters that are driven and have some inner strength and Kaz definitely didn’t disappoint me. He’s so strong but vulnerable at the same time and I swear when I read about his past and saw how much he struggled my heart actually ached for him. It was so hard to watch him while he tried to keep his composure and whenever I read his POV it felt like his anxiety choked me. There is so much more to Kaz than initially meets the eye and I can’t believe that no one of his crew ever bothered to see past his disguise. Not even Inej…. *sigh*”Sure of yourself, aren’t you, Brekker?”“Myself and nothing else.””You might say I’m a lockpick.”“You must be a very gifted one.”“I am indeed.” Kaz leaned back slightly. “You see, every man is a safe, a vault of secrets and longings. Now, there are those who take the brute’s way, but I prefer a gentler approach – the right pressure applied at the right moment, in the right place. It’s a delicate thing.””It was because she was listening so closely that she knew the exact moment when Kaz Brekker, Dirtyhands, the bastard of the Barrel and the deadliest boy in Ketterdam, fainted.”Inej:”Her eyes were so brown they were almost black, and for once her hair was down. She always wore it tied back in a ruthlessly tight coil. Even the idea of being this near someone should have set his skin crawling. Instad he thought, What happens if I move closer?”Oh how much I liked this brave and calm girl. The “Wraith” was awesome and considering her past I really couldn’t help but had to admire her strength. Just like Kaz she also had secrets she didn’t want to share and whenever she came across Tante Heleen I was literally able to taste her fear. It was so painful to read what she’d gone through and what had happened to her but at the same time her courage kind of threw me. I mean there is this fragile little girl that was once one of Tante Heleen’s many subjects and even though she’s so young and small, she’s still a lethal weapon who’s able to kill even the strongest man. Inej is kick-ass and I loved her for it!!! XD”Inej – “ said Kaz.“Nina and I can get inside,” she continued. Her back was straight, her tone steady. She looked like someone facing the firing squad and saying damn the blindfolds. “We enter with the Menagerie.”Matthias:”It’s not natural for women to fight.”“It’s not natural for someone to be as stupid as he is tall, and yet there you stand.”Haha oh man, Matthias! What to say about him? He’s a huge and stupid brute but I still love him! *lol* I could understand why he was so angry at Nina and what bound him to his people but sometimes I just wanted to shake him for his stupidity! At the beginning of the book he was so ignorant and oblivious to his faults but the more I got to know him the more I could see why Nina fell for him. He’s one of those men that have a hard shell and a soft core and even though he has his flaws, he still always tried to do the right thing. I think his main problem was that he’d been indoctrinated to hate Grisha from a very young age and to me his struggle to overcome his prejudices was visible in every single sentence and line.”It had started with a storm, and in a way, that storm had never ended. Nina had blown into his life with the wind and rain and set his world spinning. He’d been off balance ever since.”Matthias pressed his forehead once, briefly, against Brum’s. He knew his mentor could not hear him, but he spoke the words anyway. “The life you live, the hate you feel – it’s poison. I can drink it no longer.”Nina:You’re heavier than it says on this paper, I’ll wager.”She shrugged artfully, the scales of her neckline slipping lower. “I like to eat when I’m in the mood,” she said, puckering her lips shamelessly. “And I’m always in the mood.”God that woman is so fierce and has the heart of a lion!!! Nina is so compassionate and lovely and I immediately loved her for it! She’s never afraid to say what she’s thinking and she’s loyal to a fault. I just adored her for being so passionate and I was so sad when Matthias rejected her at the beginning. Not that this would have had any visible impact on her, after all she still had a sharp tongue and made sure to use it. *lol* ;-P Judging by what I read about this world to be one of the Grisha isn’t easy, but Nina nevertheless always somehow managed to stand her ground!“Do not bend,"" Nina snapped. ""Do not leap. Do not move abruptly. If you don't promise to take it easy, I'll slow your heart and keep you in a coma until I can be sure you've recovered fully.""""Nina Zenik, as soon as I figure out where you've put my knifes, we're going to have words.""""The first ones had better be 'Thank you, oh great Nina, for dedicating every waking moment of this miserable journey to saving my sorry life'.""Jesper:“Now it was risk filling up his nose and mouth, making him feel giddy and invincible. He loved it, and he hated himself for loving it.He’s the cocky smartass of the group and his comments always made me laugh. I loved the way he tried to ease the tension and how he worked as a buffer between all those different characters. I’m pretty sure if the crew wouldn’t have had the sharpshooter they might have been at each other’s throats in an instant and I’m really thankful Bardugo added him to the crew. I didn’t expect him to be a Grisha though and when I found out I was genuinely surprised. I think one day his countless vices will get him in deep trouble and I really hope that we’ll get to know him even better in the next book.”You guys are going to make this really fun, aren’t you?” asked Jesper. “Usually people don’t start hating each other until a week into the job, but you two have a head start.”They cast him twin glares, and Jesper beamed back at them, but Kaz’s attention was focused on the plans.Wylan:”They hadn’t even left Ketterdam, and Wylan already seemed completely out of his depth. He wasn’t much younger than Kaz, but somehow looked like a child – smooth-skinned, wide-eyed, like a silk-eared puppy in a room full of fighting dogs.”This boy was the cutest thing ever! He’s such an adorable and innocent cinnamon roll!!! I instantly fell in love with Wylan and I’m already afraid to find out more about his past. The relationship with his father was more than just tense and I’m convinced there happened something bad that caused him to move out of his father’s house. It broke my heart when I found out that he seems to be illiterate and that his mean idiot of a father mocked him with it. =( And *lol* for someone who’s as innocent as Wylan to keep up with the crew actually was a hell of an accomplishment! Let’s take a second and appreciate this awesome, clever, courageous and smart boy!!! =)))”I’m good at demo.”“You’re passable at demo. You’re excellent at hostage.”We’re not going in through the embassy,” said Kaz. “Always hit where the mark isn’t looking.”“Who’s Mark?” asked Wylan.The ships:Nina & Matthias:”A good time needn’t involve wine and … and flesh,” Matthias sputtered.Nina batted her glossy lashes at him. “You wouldn’t know a good time if it sidled up to you and stuck a lollipop in your mouth.Those two gave me a serious headache!!! I knew they both loved each other but Matthias vehemently refused to acknowledge his feelings for Nina and it almost drove me insane! *lol* There were moments when I was tempted to throw the book against a wall and swore that I would hate Matthias forever, but then there were also those secret admissions to his true feelings and they kind of outweighed everything else. I have to admit that I also loved the way how Nina and Matthias pushed each other and them playing cat and mouse was just so much fun to hold it against them. XD But oh my god that scene at the end when Matthias took Nina’s hand? Gosh it made me cry and smile at the same time…”And what did you do, Matthias? What did you do to me in your dreams?”The ship listed gently. The laterns swayed. His eyes were blue fire. “Everything,” he said, as he turned to go. “Everything.”He took her hand and kissed her knuckles genly. She winced, but when he tried to pull away, she clutched him tighter.“Stay,” she panted. Tears leaked from her eyes. “Stay till the end.”“And after,” he said. “And always.”“I want to feel safe again. I want to go home to Ravka.”“Then I’ll take you there. We’ll set fire to raisins or whatever you heathens do for fun.”“Zealot,” she said weakly.“Witch.”“Barbarian.”“Nina,” he whispered, “little red bird. Don’t go.”Kaz & Inej:”Keep talking, Wraith. Don’t slip away from me.”“But it’s what I do best.”They killed me! Their love was so bittersweet that it sometimes even caused me to stop breathing. Their emotions were so intense and gentle and yet their circumstances made it impossible to be together. I know everyone is blaming Kaz for holding back and turning Inej down but I can’t bring myself to be angry at him. Not after I saw his struggle and know what he’s been through. To touch other people is pure torture for him, yet he still let Inej reach out to him. It cost him so much just to stand there and let her caress his cheek, but he did it because he actually truly loves her!!! Gosh! Kaz and his fear to be touched killed me and the knowledge Inej didn’t understand his inner conflict actually shattered my heart! I can’t …. Argh I just can’t seem to be able to put into words how much this destroyed me!!! It put my heart through the meat grinder and shredded it into thousand tiny pieces…. It caused me to swallow, it made me gasp for air, it simply wrenched my breath away… It caused me to feel a pang in the center of my chest and my heart is still bleeding… Especially now that they took Inej!!!”Kaz tumbled through the dark. He was colder than he’d ever been. He thought of Inej’s hand on his cheek. His mind had gone jagged at the sensation, a riot of confusion. It had been terror and disgust and – in all of that clamour - desire, a wish that lingered still, the hope that she would touch him again.””She’d laughed, and if he could have bottled the sound and got drunk on it every night, he would have. It terrified him.””I can hear the change in Kaz’s breathing when he looks at you.”“You … you can?”“It catches every time, like he’s never seen you before.”He took a deep breath. “I want you to stay. I want you to … I want you.”“You want me.” She turned the words over. Gently, she squeezed his hand. “And how will you have me, Kaz?”He looked at her then, eyes fierce, mouth set. It was the face he wore when he was fighting.“How will you have me?” she repeated. “Fully clothed, gloves on, your head turned away so our lips can never touch?”He released her hand, his shoulders bunching, his gaze angry and ashamed as he turned his face to the sea.Maybe it was because his back was to her that she could finally speak the words. “I will have you without armour, Kaz Brekker. Or I will not have you at all.”Jesper & Wylan:”Close your eyes!”“You can’t kiss me from down there, Wylan.”I loved the slow development of their relationship. Jesper never missed a chance to tease Wylan and even though Wylan was so innocent and shy he still somehow managed to hit back at him! *lol* There were so many meaningful and short moments between those two boys and I really wanted to see that ship sail!!! Unfortunately their love story was just in the background and pretty one-sided because we never actually got a chance to read Wylan’s point of view! *lol* So yeah I hope there are some Wylan chapters in the next book and please, please, please let Wylan get back his beautiful and “stupid face”!! Haha I know it’s petty but Jesper wasn’t the only one that liked his face! *lol*“Pull your shirt up over your mouth,” he told Wylan.“What?”“Stop being dense. You’re cuter when you’re smart.”Wylan’s cheeks went pink. He scowled and pulled his collar up.”If only you could talk to girls in equations.”There was a long silence, and then, eyes trained on the notch they’d created in the link, Wylan said, “Just girls?”Jesper restrained a grin.”No. Not just girls.”All things considered this book was amazing and beautifully written! It’s a piece of art that kept me captivated from the beginning to the very end and I think throughout this journey I actually became a part of the crew!So to all of my fellow Dregs, this is the way my review finally ends:”No mourners, no funerals.” ;-)",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23437156-six-of-crows,Six of Crows.txt
Any Which Wall,"When you develop a team of siblings whose job it will be to solve a mystery, survive an adventure, or deal with magic, you have three choices. You can establish verisimilitude by making them sniping, squabbling siblings who insult each other and barely endure each other's company, like the Grace family in Tony DiTerlizzi's Spiderwick stories; you can make them react believably to danger and uncertainty by banding tightly together, viz the Baudelaire siblings, who are as supportive and encouraging of each other as the events surrounding them are unfortunate.Or you can take the middle path. Think Aldens. Or Cassons. Heck, think of the March girls. They don't always agree, and sometimes a fit is pitched, but as far as I'm concerned, there's your verisimilitude. No hair-pulling required.What I'm saying is: brave, considerate, honest and smart does not equal BORING. Laurel Snyder's Any Which Wall is a Penderwick-y book, a Nesbitty book, an avowedly Eagery book, featuring four children who discover a wall that works magic, and who must figure out how to use it and what it can do. Once they've got that sorted, the next step for each kid is to decide - what to wish for. What's YOUR heart's desire? Hard to say? Try making that decision when you're six.But while each child makes this decision based on his or her own interests (Henry wants pirates, Roy chooses American history, little Emma wants a castle, while big girl Susan just wants to see her best friend again), their adventures give each kid the opportunity to stretch underused muscles: independence, honesty, logic, compassion.The writing is clear and pleasant - Laurel Snyder has a particular gift for describing place, and her dialogue is natural and unaffected. LeUyen Pham I have to guess was just a gift from Laurel's editor. Nobody draws regular kids, with their quirks of gesture and occasional annoyed expression, like Ms. Pham. Between the two of them, they've created four children as real as the kids messing around on my porch at this very minute.",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4628647-any-which-wall,Any Which Wall.txt
The Red Pyramid,"The Red Pyramid (Kane Chronicles #1), Rick RiordanThe Red Pyramid is a 2010 fantasy-adventure novel based on Egyptian mythology written by Rick Riordan. It is the first novel in The Kane Chronicles series. The novel was first published in the United States on May 4, 2010.The novel opens with Carter and his father Julius Kane going to visit Carter's sister Sadie, who has lived with her maternal grandparents since the death of their mother, Ruby Kane. Julius, who is secretly a magician, but posing as a simple Egyptologist, takes the siblings to the British Museum, where he tries to bring Osiris (the Egyptian god of the Underworld) back into the mortal world.His magic also has the unintended side effect of summoning the gods Horus, Isis, Nephthys, and Set, as well as alerting the magicians Zia Rashid and Michel Desjardins to his actions, which are illegal in the magic community.Set, a god of chaos, captures Julius and destroys the museum. Unbeknownst to Carter and Sadie, each of the gods chooses a mortal host from the humans in the room.Carter and Sadie are taken to Brooklyn by their uncle Amos, who tells them they are descended from a long line of magicians, beginning with the Egyptian pharaohs Ramesses the Great and Narmer. He also explains the grave danger Set poses to the world, and goes to find him. While he is away, the mansion is attacked by Set's minions.With help from Sadie's cat Muffin, who is host to the goddess Bast, and Zia Rashid, they escape to Cairo. Once there, Carter and Sadie discover they are hosts to the gods Horus and Isis, respectively.They train in magic until the magicians' leader Iskandar dies and Michel Desjardins orders their deaths for collaborating illegally with the gods. The siblings escape and formulate a plan to defeat Set hoping to rescue their father and clear their names within the magic community.They travel to Set's lair in New Mexico, gathering ingredients for a magic spell and evading hostile monsters and magicians. Bast sacrifices herself while defending Carter and Sadie from Sobek; they encounter Amos and then Zia.The foursome heads to Set's hideout where they learn the final piece of the spell they need from a dying Zia, the unknowing host of Nephthys. Carter, Sadie, Horus, and Isis use the spell to subdue Set, although they stop short of completely destroying him because they realize his actions were dictated by a far worse enemy Apophis, a much more powerful god of chaos. Desjardins reluctantly allows Carter and Sadie to go free after they part with Horus and Isis.After a tearful goodbye with Zia, who turns out to have been a magical copy of the real young magician, Carter and Sadie return to Brooklyn. They visit their father, now in the underworld with their ghostly mother.As a gift, Osiris (hosted by the deceased Julius) helps Bast return to the mortal world. Carter and Sadie describe their plans to recruit other magicians to (illegally) study the path of the gods, while the former also resolves to seek out the real Zia Rashid.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و نهم سپتامبر سال 2016میلادیعنوان: هرم سرخ - کتاب یک - سه گانه خاطرات خاندان کین؛ نویسنده ریک ریوردان؛ مترجم: آیدا کشوری؛ ویراستار فرزام حبیبی اصفهانی؛ تهران، بهنام، سال1391؛ در536ص؛ از مجموعه خاطرات خاندان کین - کتاب اول؛ شابک9789645668936؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 21معنوان: هرم سرخ - کتاب یک - سه گانه وقایع نگاری کین؛ نویسنده: ریک ریوردان؛ مترجم: احمد محمدزاده؛ تهران، ای.بوک: پرشین بکس، سال1391؛ در396ص؛این داستان، در مورد زندگی: «سادی کین»؛ «کارتر کین»؛ و پدرشان است، که هر کدام، قسمت هایی از داستان را، روایت میکنند؛ داستان پس از ناپدید شدن پدر، روی میدهد، و آندو درمییابند، که از اعضای خانواده ای قدیمی، و «مصری» هستند، و مرگ مادرشان نیز، به این موضوع ربط دارد؛نقل از متن: («وقایع نگاری کین، جلد نخست هرم سرخ»؛ اثر «ریک ریوردن»؛ مترجم جناب آقای: «احمد محمدزاده»؛ کارتر؛ فصل اول: مرگ در محل سوزن: ما فقط، چند ساعت فرصت داریم، پس به دقت گوش کنید؛ اگر در حال شنیدن این داستان هستید، پس، از حالا، در خطرید؛ شاید من و «سادی»، تنها شانس شما باشیم؛ به مدرسه بروید؛ قفسه را پیدا کنید؛ نمیگویم، چه مدرسه ای، یا چه قفسه ای، چون اگر شما، همان فرد باشید، پیدایش میکنید؛ رمز قفل 33/32/13 است، وقتی همه ی ماجرا را شنیدید، معنای این شماره ها را، خواهید فهمید؛ فقط، به یاد داشته باشید، داستانی که میخواهیم برایتان بازگو کنیم، هنوز تمام نشده است، و پایان آن، به شما بستگی دارد؛ مهمترین نکته این است، که بعد از باز کردن، و دیدن محتویات آن، بسته را بیشتر از یک هفته، نگه ندارید؛ مطمئنا،ً وسوسه کننده است؛ منظورم این است، که قدرتی تقریباً نامحدود، به شما میدهد؛ اما اگر، برای مدتی طولانی، آن را نگه دارید، شما را، از پا میاندازد؛ رازهایش را کشف، و آنرا برای نفر بعدی، مخفی کنید؛ همانطور که من، و «سادی»، آن را برای شما، مخفی کردیم؛ سپس خودتان را، برای زندگی بسیار جالبی، آماده کنید؛ بسیار خب، «سادی» میگوید سریعتر، سر اصل مطلب بروم؛ خیلی خوب؛ فکر کنم از «لندن» و از شبی که پدرمان، موزه ی «بریتانیا» را، منفجر کرد، شروع شد؛ و ...)؛ پایان نقلتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 12/11/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 02/08/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی",Fantasy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7090447-the-red-pyramid,The Red Pyramid.txt
Where the Sidewalk Ends,"من به یک سری از دلایل، انگیزه های زیادی ندارم برای اینکه بچه ای از خون و ریشه های خودم داشته باشم. بچه ها رو دوست دارم، حتی تربیت کردن بچه هم مشکلی نیست، مشکل از همون پله اول سرچشمه می گیره، اینکه 50 درصد از مسئولیت اومدن یه انسان جدید به این جهان رو بر عهده بگیری و به این نتیجه برسی که قادر به این خواهی بود که این جهان رو اونقدر خوب برای بچه ـت رقم بزنی که اومدنش بهتر از نیومدنش باشهاما از وقتی با کتاب های شل سیلوراستاین آشنا شدم، به جرأت می تونم بگم که علاقه خیلی بیشتری به ایده بچه داشتن پیدا کردم. حین خوندن کتاب هاش، این ایده که که ساعت 11 شب، یه بچه 5 ساله رو ببری توی اتاق خوابش، روشنایی اتاقش رو خاموش کنی، شبخواب ـش رو روشن کنی و براش از شعرهای عمو شلبی بخونی تا خوابش ببره رهام نمی کنه. شعرهای سیلوراستاین به بزرگترین انگیزه ـم از بچه داشتن تبدیل شده و این مبالغه نیستبه این فکر می کنم که بچه ای که این شعرها رو از همون دوران خردسالی براش خونده باشن و این مضامین توی ضمیرش نقش بسته باشه، چقدر می تونه سطح فکری بالاتری از هم سن و سال هاش داشته باشه و چقدر می تونه در آینده برای ""زمین"" مفید باشه. مضامینی که سیلوراستاین بهشون پرداخته انقدر متنوع و زیادن که حتی از تمام چیزهایی که شما به عنوان والدین قراره به بچه یاد بدید هم بیشتره و کامل تره! و جالب این جاست که بعضی هاشون انقدر عمیق هستن که حتی واسه منِ 21 ساله هم آموزنده هستن. یکی از شعرهایی که حس کردم خودم هم می تونم ازش یاد بگیرم این بود:Just ME, Just MeSweet Marie, she loves just me(she also loves Maurice McGhee)No she don't, she loves just me(She also loves Louise Dupree)No she don't, she loves just me(She also loves the willow tree)No she don't, she loves just me(Poor, poor fool, why can't you seeShe can love others and still love thee)من حداقل تا یکی دو سال پیش توی درک و هضم مضمومنی که توی شعر بالا بهش پرداخته شده عاجز بودم و آدمایی رو هم می شناسم که این مشکل رو دارن، بنابراین این نشون میده که شعرهای سیلوراستاین با اینکه در وهله اول برای بچه ها نوشته شدن، ولی مخاطبشون می تونه خیلی خیلی گسترده تر از ""فقط بچه ها"" باشهواقعاً باور دارم که اگه مردم دنیا شعرهای سیلوراستاین رو مثل یه قرارداد نا نوشته از همون بچگی برای بچه هاشون بخونن، مفهوم دنیایی ازصلح و یه حسی مثه نفرت از جنگ و خون ریزی توی ذهن ها بچه ها نقش می بنده و شاید یه دنیای بهتر رو داشته باشیم. این شعر رو بخونید مثلاً:Hug O' WarI will not play at tug o' war,I'd rather play at hug o' war,Where everyone hugsInstead of tugs,Where everyone gigglesand rolls on the rug,Where everyone kisses,And everyone grins,And everyone cuddles,And everyone wins.و هر شعر هم نقاشی خاص خودش رو داره که برای بچه هایی که سواد خوندن کتاب رو ندارن، جذابیت مضاعف ایجاد می کنه و بن مایه شعر رو می تونن از نقاشی مربوط به شعر درک کننمن خودم جزء اون بچه های خوش شانسی بودم که پدر مادرم و عمه عزیزم توی بچگی برام کتاب داستان می گرفتن و می خوندن و با کتاب بزرگ شدم. با این وجود، کتاب داستان هایی که من خوندم این درجه از غنا رو نداشتن. کتاب داستان های اوایل دهه هفتاد بودن که معمولاً حول محور ""حسن کچل"" می چرخیدن و الان تنها چیزی که ازشون یادم مونده اینه:کچل کچل کلاچهروغن کله پاچهکه اینجا شاید نویسنده می خواست این پیام رو بده که نباید کچل ها رو مسخره کرد به خاطر مو نداشتنشون، ولی بر عکس این شعره توی ضمیر ناخودآگاه نقش می بست و هر وقت یه آدم کچل یا بچه ای که موهاش رو زده بودن رو می دیدم، این شعره رو می خوندم!این کتاب رو از یه حراجی پیدا کردم و دلیل اینکه خریدمش هم دو زبانه بودنش (یه طرف متن اصلی، یه طرف متن ترجمه شده) بود. پیشنهادم اینه که هر نوع شعر خارجی رو اگه به زبان اصلی نمی خونید، حتی الامکان به صورت دو زبانه بخونید و فقط به متن فارسی اکتفا نکنید. همه ـمون می دونیم که ترجمه شعر چقدر کار سختیه و چقدر از زیبایی ها و احساسات اصیل شعر در ترجمه از بین میره یا تغییر می کنه. به شخصه قسمت انگلیسی کتاب رو خوندم، ولی ترجمه ها هم خیلی خیلی عالی صورت گرفته بود و حتی یک اشکال ترجمه هم توش پیدا نکردم. نسخه من از نشر ""هوای تازه"" و با ترجمه ""رضی خدادادی"" بود.در پایان، یکی از شعرهای کوتاه و زیبای کتاب رو به عنوان حسن ختام می نویسم:LISTEN TO THE MUSTN'TSListen to the MUST'NTS, child,Listen to the DON'TSListen to the SHOULDN'TSThe IMPOSSIBLES, the WON'TSListen to the NEVER HAVESThen listen close to me_Anything can happen, child,ANYTHING can be",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30119.Where_the_Sidewalk_Ends,Where the Sidewalk Ends.txt
Dien Cai Dau,"This coming Thursday marks the 40th anniversary of the conclusion of the Vietnamese-American War. For me and for other diasporic Vietnamese like me, this date is especially significant, as it stakes out not just a traumatic event in our family histories but also a turning point: April 30, 1975 was the calendar date on which our families were reborn, redefined, translated, transmuted into English speakers, America dwellers, U.S. citizens.On the back of this book, there is a blurb written by the late American poet William Matthews: ""The best writing we've had from the long war in Vietnam has been prose so far. Yusef Komunyakaa'sDien Cai Dauchanges that."" Presumably, this quotation was elicited from Matthews around the time ofDien Cai Dau's first printing, in 1988. Since that time, it's safe to say the genre of Vietnam-War-related poetry has radically changed, growing broader, deeper, and more complex, to the point where Matthews's quote now seems a relic of a different geological age.When I was growing up in the American Midwest in the '80s and '90s, it seemed that the predominant narrative about the Vietnam War in U.S. media and U.S. literature was one that was firmly centered around a U.S. military perspective: in this collective cultural narrative, Vietnamese people were portrayed rather two-dimensionally as inscrutable yellow-skinned foreigners whose subjectivity either did not exist or could not be accessed. Vietnamese women, in particular, were depicted as either simple-minded rustics or unctuous whores. Englishman Graham Greene's 1955 novelThe Quiet Americanadmittedly predates this historical moment, but its introduction of a Vietnamese female character named Phuong -- alluring yet opaque, dim-witted yet unconsciously, tantalizingly sexual, a commodity to be fought over rather than identified with -- was echoed in western writers' portrayals of Vietnamese women for decades to follow. Contrast this erstwhile poverty of imagination with the current state of Vietnam-War-related literature: in both prose and poetry, there is now a wide range of diverse perspectives on the scene, including a whole host of powerful diasporic Vietnamese poetic voices -- voices like Linh Dinh's, Bao Phi's, Cathy Linh Che's, Ocean Vuong's, and Hieu Minh Nguyen's, to name just a few.In the context of this atomically potent, new poetic paradigm, Matthews's quotation is all the more striking. It is striking because it reminds us that, in a way, we have Yusef Komunyakaa to thank for the richness and nuance that now defines the genre of Vietnam War poetry. Komunyakaa'sDien Cai Dauwas the forerunner of it all. It is the beginning that we have to thank for today's robust middle.This slim book follows a taut, carefully constructed arc. It begins with poems about military maneuvers, treks, patrols, long periods in which gruff men lived in the company of other gruff men, watching and waiting for the inevitable to happen. The book then moves on to evocations of the non-masculine lives the war touched, the Vietnamese monks and (especially) the Vietnamese women, how some were burned alive or raped, consigned to the role of a military man's two-timed mistress or his saviour symbol. Then we get snapshots of how the military men spent their precious moments of leisure time: playing volleyball, listening to music, seeking sexual release. Then there are poems about POWs (on both sides), the brutalities they faced. This section segues seamlessly into a suite of poems about the unique struggles confronted by African-Americans in the U.S. military, fighting for a country in which racial inequality and segregation were still a reality. In the bleak prose poem ""The One-Legged Stool,"" the speaker, an African-American POW, tells his North Vietnamese captors: ""I've been through Georgia. Yeah, been through 'Bama, too.... You eye me worse than those rednecks. They used to look at me in my uniform like I didn't belong in it.... All I have to go back to are faces like yours at the door."" Receiving word of Martin Luther King's assassination back home is an additional cause of demoralization in the African-American soldiers Komunyakaa portrays. Finally, the book ends with an elegiac contemplation of the crippled lives the war left in its wake when it ended, forty years ago this week: the boat people, the ostracized mixed-race children, the broken marriages, the bereaved families, the vets grappling with survivors' guilt and PTSD.There is a lamentable typo in the edition of this book that I bought: ""dui boi"" instead of ""bui doi."" Hopefully, this error was corrected in later editions. Overall, though, this is a book with an authoritative narrative voice, informed by intimate firsthand knowledge of Vietnam and of the Vietnam War (Komunyakaa even name-drops the 18th-to-19th-century Vietnamese poet Ho Xuan Huong in his poem ""Saigon Bar Girls, 1975"" -- a demonstration of deep cultural literacy that only the best writers in the field can match). The language is lyrical and imaginative, full of gloriously unexpected yet emotionally and visually precise metaphors: ""Like an angel/pushed up against what hurts/his globe-shaped helmet/follows the gold ring his flashlight/casts into the void."" This week, as the 40th anniversary of the fall of Saigon is commemorated, take a moment to sample the poems in this book. Read""Toys in a Field""; read ""Boat People."" Yes, there is much to mourn here, but there is also a birth, a new beginning, to celebrate.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/978917.Dien_Cai_Dau,Dien Cai Dau.txt

The Diwan of Abu'l-Ala,"Now the book is finished, so far as I shall finish it. There is, my friend, but this one page to write. And, more than probably, this is the page of all the book that I shall never wish to blot. Increasing wisdom or, at any rate, experience will make me frown, I promise you, some time or other at a large proportion of the pages of this volume. But when I look upon your name I hear a troop of memories, and in their singing is my happiness. When you receive this book, presuming that the Russian Censor does not shield you from it, I have some idea what you will do. The string, of course, must not be cut, and you will seriously set about the disentangling of it. One hand assists by holding up, now near the nose now farther off, your glasses; the other hand pecks at the string. After, say, twenty minutes there will enter the admirable Miss Fox—oh! the tea she used to make for us when we were freezing on the mountains of Bulgaria, what time our Chicagoan millionaire was ruffled and Milyukov, the adventurous professor, standing now not far from Russia's helm, would always drive ahead of us and say, with princely gesture, that if we suffered from the dust it was advisable that he should be the one to meet the fury of the local lions. But do not let us lose the scent: Miss Fox, that woman of resource, will cut the string. And later on, while to her you are dictating things political and while your other secretary is discoursing music, mournful Russian music, then with many wrinkles on your brow you will hold the book at arm's length.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19680545-the-diwan-of-abu-l-ala,The Diwan of Abu'l-Ala.txt

Rübab-ı Şikeste,"Tevfik Fikret (Ottoman Turkish: توفیق فكرت) was the pseudonym of Mehmed Tevfik (December 24, 1867 – August 19, 1915), an Ottoman-Turkish educator and poet, who is considered the founder of the modern school of Turkish poetry.He received his education at the prestigious Galatasaray High School and graduated in 1888 as the valedictorian with the highest grades. He later became the school's principal. His sister suffered a tragic early death. In 1890 he married his cousin Nazime, and the couple had a son named Haluk in 1895.

Poems of Nazım Hikmet,"NAZIM HIKMET: WRITING POETRY WITH ONE’S HEARTLiterature is replete with stories of great artists who were hunted and persecuted during their lifetime for their ideologies and convictions. Russian poets Anna Akhmatova and Osip Mandelstam and the Spanish poets Federico Garcia Lorca and Miguel Hernandez are some familiar names that immediately come to my mind. But I doubt whether any poet has suffered so much as Nazim Hikmet (1902-1963), the first modern Turkish poet and one of the most important and influential figures in 20th-century Turkish literature.A Romantic communist, Nazim Hikmet's life is the content of a legend.Hikmet served a thirteen-year jail term in Turkey, imprisoned primarily for speaking out as a communist against the economic situation of Turkey. It took an international campaign by leading artists and a hunger strike by Hikmet himself to obtain his release. Upon release in 1951, he shared Soviet Union’s International Peace Prize with Pablo Neruda. Irritated once again, the Turkish Government banished him forever and revoked his citizenship. This led to spending the rest of his life as an exile in Russia.These hardships and the trials of WWII provided the raw material of adventure and suffering that informed and inspired his poetry. In the perfect oneness of his life and art, Hikmet emerges as a heroic figure. He was a revolution in life and literature, flouting Ottoman literary conventions and introducing free verse and colloquial language.While going through much of his poetry, what struck me most is his deep humanism. He has that uncanny ability to vibe with any reader in any part of the universe. His poetry is imbued with rare sincerity, originality and passion for life. His is an authentic voice imbued with optimism even while sinking in darkness. I hope the poems I try to illustrate here will succeed in fathoming the essence of his poetry.CUCUMBERThe snow is knee-deep in the courtyardand still coming down hard:it hasn't let up all morning.We're in the kitchen.On the table, on the oilcloth, spring —on the table there's a very tender young cucumber,pebbly and fresh as a daisy.We're sitting around the table staring at it.It softly lights up our faces,and the very air smells fresh.We're sitting around the table staring at it,amazedthoughtfuloptimistic.We're as if in a dream.On the table, on the oilcloth, hope —on the table, beautiful days,a cloud seeded with a green sun,an emerald crowd impatient and on its way,loves blooming openly —on the table, there on the oilcloth, a very tender young cucumber,pebbly and fresh as a daisy.The snow is knee-deep in the courtyardand coming down hard.It hasn't let up all morning.The poet beautifully captures a hopeful and dreamy atmosphere in this quiet poem when a family sits around a table and watches a tender cucumber. The admiration of a cucumber because of its smell, its freshness and color leads him to much more tender and rapturous feelings . It evokes a million memories of the salad days of his life. How beautifully the poet ruminates on the emerald cucumber (with its teeming seeds) and hopes it to become the green sun in his life too. How wondrously the poet has used 'repetition' as a way to enhance the poetic message .This poem itself is worth an emerald.As mentioned, Hikmet introduced modern poetic techniques in his poetry combining these with traditional and folk styles. Here is another poem that perfects his mastery of ‘repetition’ as a stylistic device and incidentally the theme of the poem itself is repetition. In utmost simplicity, the poet speaks to his lover about the innumerable repetitions one sees in nature. They are verily joy dancing in nature and without those voiceless, clueless and endless repetitions, our life is monochrome. As the poet affirms at the end, the key is, ‘to repeat without repeating’.BACH’S CONCERTO NO. 1 IN C MINORFall morning in the vineyard:in row after row the repetition of knotty vines,of clusters on the vines,of grapes in the clusters,of light on the grapes.At night, in the big white house,the repetition of windows,each lit up separately.The repetition of all the rain that rainson earth, trees, and the sea,on my hands, face, and eyes,and of the drops crushed on the glass.The repetition of my daysthat are alike,my days that are not alike.The repetition of the thread in the weave,the repetition in the starry sky,and the repetition of “I love” in all languages,and the repetition of the tree in the leaves,and of the pain of living, which ends in an instanton every deathbed.The repetition in the snow -the light snow,the heavy wet snow,the dry snow,the repetition in the snow that whirlsin the blizzard that drives me off the road.The children are running in the courtyard;in the courtyard the children are running.An old woman is passing by on the street;on the street an old woman is passing by;passing by on the street is an old woman.At night, in the big white house,the repetition of windows,each lit up separately.In the clusters, of grapes,on the grapes, of light.To walk toward the good, the just, the true,to fight for the good, the just, the true,to seize the good, the just, the true.Your silent tears and smile, my rose,your sobs and bursts of laughter, my rose,the repetition of your shining white teeth when you laugh.Fall morning in the vineyard:in row after row the repetition of knotty vines,of clusters on the vines,of grapes in the clusters,of light on the grapes,of my heart in the light.My rose, this is the miracle of repetition -to repeat without repeating.(PS: I have strived to maintain the syntax as given in the book. GR borderline format is unsuitable for maintaining syntax)The increasingly breathless pace of his late poems such as in the one below conveys the never-ending agony of man in all corners of this universe and his eagerness and heroic temper to embrace the pain of all humanity. There is sense urgency in many of his poems as if time is accelerating for him and it hooks the reader.ANGINA PECTORISIf half my heart is here, doctor,the other half is in Chinawith the army flowingtoward the Yellow river.And, every morning, doctor,every morning at sunrise my heartis shot in Greece.And every night, doctor,when the prisoners are asleep and the infirmary is deserted,my heart stops at a run-down old housein Istanbul.And then after ten yearsall I have to offer my poor peopleis this apple in my hand, doctor,one red apple:my heart.And that, doctor, that is the reasonfor this angina pectoris-not nicotine, prison, or arteriosclerosis.I look at the night through the bars,and despite the weight on my chestmy heart still beats with the most distant stars.There are poets who, while they love all the bounties and blessings of nature and life, advocate binding bond with their fellow human beings as their pivotal principle and Hikmet was one of them. In his style and humanistic vision, he can be compared with Neruda with whom he shared a deep kinship (Mayakovski could be cited as another people’s poet). In his touching “Last letter to my Son’, he gives the following advice.FromLAST LETTER TO MY SONDon’t live in the world as if you were rentingor here only for the summer,but act as if it was your father’s house. . .Believe in seeds, earth, and the sea,but people above all.Love clouds, machines, and books,but people above all.Grievefor the withering branch,the dying star,and the hurt animal,but feel for people above all.Rejoice in all the earth’s blessings –darkness and light,the four seasons,but people above all.The emotional directness and his fresh, down-to-earth imagery- e.g., ""you must live with great seriousness / like a squirrel"" orone red apple: / my heart""as inAngina Pectoris,night descending like a tired bird on a smoky wet plainorthe evening star / sparkling like a glass of water-are scintillating. No poet I know of today can compare with Nazim when it comes to the scope, range, and quality of his achievement and the freshness of his metaphors and imageries.The Selected poems of Nazim Hikmetsensitively and carefully translated by Randy Blasing and his Turkish wife Mutlu Konuk is a treasure trove for poetry lovers . There are many wonderful long poems in this collection and some of my favourites happen to be the long ones likeLetters from a Man in Solitary, 9-10 P.M. Poems, Since I Was Thrown Inside, On Living, Some Advice to Those Who Will Serve Time in Prison, Straw-Blond, Autobiography, and Things I Didn't Know I Loved.In the poemThings I Didn’t Know I lovedthe poet chronicles everything (earth, rivers, stars, flowers) with fresh eyes and records with awe that he didn’t know he loved them so intensely. The poem contains arresting passages like the one below.FromTHINGS I DIDN’T KNOW I LOVEDI’ve written this somewhere beforewading through a dark muddy street I’m going to the shadow playRamazan nighta paper lantern leading the waymaybe nothing like this ever happenedmaybe I read it somewhere an eight-year-old boygoing to the shadow playRamazan night in Istanbul holding his grandfather’s handhis grandfather has on a fez and is wearing the fur coatwith a sable collar over his robeand there’s a lantern in the servant’s handand I can’t contain myself for joyflowers come to mind for some reasonpoppies cactuses jonquilsin the jonquil garden in Kadikoy Istanbul I kissed Marikafresh almonds on her breathI was seventeenmy heart on a swing touched the skyI didn’t know I loved flowersfriends sent me three red carnations in prisonI just remembered the starsI love them toowhether I’m floored watching them from belowor whether I’m flying at their sideThe most striking ""aspect"" of his life and work is the way he followed his heart wherever it led him, whether in his life or in his work, without regard for how he appeared to others or the world at large. He didn't keep up appearances but acted on his feelings in his life and put his feelings into poetry, no matter how he looked.FromON LIVING""This earth will grow cold,a star among starsand one of the smallest,a gilded mote on blue velvet--I mean this, our great earth.This earth will grow cold one day,not like a block of iceor a dead cloud evenbut like an empty walnut it will roll alongin pitch-black space . .You must grieve for this right now--you have to feel this sorrow now--for the world must be loved this muchif you're going to say ""I lived"". . .|A great poet feels the pulse of everything in this universe, even the cry of an earthworm. These final lines quoted above from the poem in three sections, with the emphatic “You must grieve for this right now” are as forceful as a commandment. Only by embracing mortality “right now”, by understanding and feeling life’s negation, can we live fully. Loving life to the point of grieving for its loss is inseparable from truly living – the half-rhyme of “loved” and “lived” in this translation underscores this.Like Whitman, Hikmet speaks of himself, his country, and the world in the same breath. At once personal and public, his poetry records his life without reducing it to self-consciousness; he affirms reality of facts at the same time that he insists in the validity of his feelings. His human presence - playful, optimistic, and capable of childlike joy- keeps his poems open, public, and committed to social and artistic change. And in the perfect oneness of his life and art, Hikmet emerges as a heroic figure. His early poems proclaim this unity as a faith: art is an event, he maintains, in social as well as literary history, and a poet's bearing in art is inseparable from his bearing in life. The rest of Hikmet's life gave him ample opportunity to act upon this faith and, in fact to deepen it.As Terrence Des Pres observes:Hikmet's exemplary life and special vision - at once historical and timeless, Marxist and mystical - had unique consequences for his art: Simply because in his art and in his person Hikmet opposes the enemies of the human spirit in harmony with itself and the earth, he can speak casually and yet with a seriousness that most modern American poets never dream of attempting.Nazim’s poetry is a celebration of our joys and sorrows. His poems are fresh, intimate, honest, uncompromising, gently humorous, musical, filled with longing and hope and refuse to let despair triumph in spite of outward circumstances. It is with a sense of euphoria that I recommend this marvelous poetry collection to all poetry lovers across the globe.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/220805.Poems_of_Naz_m_Hikmet,Poems of Nazım Hikmet.txt

Bertolt Brecht: Bütün Şiirlerinden Seçmeler,"Eugen Berthold Friedrich Brechtwas a German poet, playwright, and theatre director. A seminal theatre practitioner of the twentieth century, Brecht made equally significant contributions to dramaturgy and theatrical production, the latter particularly through the seismic impact of the tours undertaken by the Berliner Ensemble—the post-war theatre company operated by Brecht and his wife and long-time collaborator, the actress Helene Weigel—with its internationally acclaimed productions.From his late twenties Brecht remained a life-long committed Marxist who, in developing the combined theory and practice of his 'epic theatre', synthesized and extended the experiments of Piscator and Meyerhold to explore the theatre as a forum for political ideas and the creation of a critical aesthetics of dialectical materialism. Brecht's modernist concern with drama-as-a-medium led to his refinement of the 'epic form' of the drama (which constitutes that medium's rendering of 'autonomization' or the 'non-organic work of art'—related in kind to the strategy of divergent chapters in Joyce's novelUlysses, to Eisenstein's evolution of a constructivist 'montage' in the cinema, and to Picasso's introduction of cubist 'collage' in the visual arts). In contrast to many other avant-garde approaches, however, Brecht had no desire to destroy art as an institution; rather, he hoped to 're-function' the apparatus of theatrical production to a new social use. In this regard he was a vital participant in the aesthetic debates of his era—particularly over the 'high art/popular culture' dichotomy—vying with the likes of Adorno, Lukács, Bloch, and developing a close friendship with Benjamin. Brechtian theatre articulated popular themes and forms with avant-garde formal experimentation to create a modernist realism that stood in sharp contrast both to its psychological and socialist varieties. ""Brecht's work is the most important and original in European drama since Ibsen and Strindberg,"" Raymond Williams argues, while Peter Bürger insists that he is ""the most important materialist writer of our time.""As Jameson among others has stressed, ""Brecht is also ‘Brecht’""—collective and collaborative working methods were inherent to his approach. This 'Brecht' was a collective subject that ""certainly seemed to have a distinctive style (the one we now call 'Brechtian') but was no longer personal in the bourgeois or individualistic sense."" During the course of his career, Brecht sustained many long-lasting creative relationships with other writers, composers, scenographers, directors, dramaturgs and actors; the list includes: Elisabeth Hauptmann, Margarete Steffin, Ruth Berlau, Slatan Dudow, Kurt Weill, Hanns Eisler, Paul Dessau, Caspar Neher, Teo Otto, Karl von Appen, Ernst Busch, Lotte Lenya, Peter Lorre, Therese Giehse, Angelika Hurwicz, and Helene Weigel herself. This is ""theatre as collective experiment [...] as something radically different from theatre as expression or as experience.""There are few areas of modern theatrical culture that have not felt the impact or influence of Brecht's ideas and practices; dramatists and directors in whom one may trace a clear Brechtian legacy include: Dario Fo, Augusto Boal, Joan Littlewood, Peter Brook, Peter Weiss, Heiner Müller, Pina Bausch, Tony Kushner and Caryl Churchill. In addition to the theatre, Brechtian theories and techniques have exerted considerable sway over certain strands of film theory and cinematic practice; Brecht's influence may be detected in the films of Joseph Losey, Jean-Luc Godard, Lindsay Anderson, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Nagisa Oshima, Ritwik Ghatak, Lars von Trier, Jan Bucquoy and Hal Hartley.During the war years, Brecht became a prominent writer of the Exilliteratur. He expressed his opposition to the National Socialist and Fascist movements in his most famous plays.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41463312-bertolt-brecht,Bertolt Brecht Bütün Şiirlerinden Seçmeler.txt

ეს მეტაფორული ნათქვამია, რაც ნიშნავს იმას რომ შატილში ჩამყაყებული რწმენა-წარმოდგენებია, და ეს რწმენა-წარმოდგენები ისეთივე მყარია, როგორც კლდე, რომელიც შატილს ცად ახურავს. შინ მომავალ ალუდას თავი არ ეწონება. როგორც ჩანს, ის უკვე ფიქრობს ამ ყველაფერზე. ვაჟა ამ ყველაფრის შემდეგ ალუდასთან ერთად აფიქრებს მკითხველსაც. რას ნიშნავს მკვლელობა, რას ნიშნავს ქავის კარი. ქავის კარი სიკვდილის სიმბოლოა, ის აღბეჭდავს მოკლული ადამიანების რაოდენობას. რას ნიშნავს, როცა სხვას სიცოცხლეს ართმევ?! ნიშნავს თუ არა იმას, რომ მისი სისხლისგან ვერასდროს გათავისუფლდები, მის სისხლში ცხოვრობ და მის სისხლშივე მოკვდები. „შენ რომ სხვა მაჰკალ, შენც მოგკვლენ, მკვლელს არ შაარჩენს გვარია.“ თითქოს ეს ყველაფერი რაღაც წრებრუნვაა, სიკვდილ-სიცოცხლის, შურისძიების, ბერძნულ სამყაროში ალუდა აუცილებლად დაისჯებოდა იმით, რომ მას მოკლავდნენ, იმისთვის, რომ ბალანსი არ დარღვეულიყო, თუმცა ბალანსის შეგრძნება ვაჟასთან თითქოს არ გვაქვს, აქ პირიქით, საბერძნეთში თუ ბალანსებს ღმერთები იცავდნენ, ამ პოემის შემთხვევაში ღმერთი არ ზრუნავს ამ ყველაფერზე, არამედ მხოლოდ ადამიანი, ერთი პირი, რომელზეც ყველაფერია მინდობილი.„��ებერი ჰკითხავს უშიშა ალუდას ამბავს ცდისასა.“ ალუდაც უყვება თუ როგორ დაეწია ქისტებს და სიცოცხლეს გამოასალმა ორივე. თუმცა მუცალს პატივისცემით მოიხსენიებს „მით ვაქებ ვაჟკაცობასა, არ იყიდება ფულადა“. ამის შემდეგ ალუდა უკვე შეცვლილია, ის უკვე ლოგიკურად მიყვება და სხვანაირად აფასებს ადამიანებს. ეს ერთგვარი პარადიგმის ცვლილებაცაა. ალუდამ შეცვალა პარადიგმა, მთლიანი აზროვნების სივრცე. ის უკვე სხვა პარადიგმით აზროვნებს. „ ჩვენ ვიტყვით, კაცნი ჩვენა ვართ, მარტო ჩვენ გვზრდიან დედანი; ჩვენა ვსცხონდებით, ურჯულოთ კუპრში მიელის ქშენანი. ამის თქმით ვწარა-მარაობთ, ღვთიშვილთ უკეთეს იციან. ყველანი მართალს ამბობენ, განა ვინაცა ჰფიციან?!“ ეს სიტყვები პავლე მოციქულს მიემართება, რასაც ის ამბობს ეპისტოლეში როამელთა მიმართ, რომ კანცი არ განირჩევიან რჯულით, არამედ მათი საქმეებით. ვაჟა ფშაველას წაკითხული ჰქონდა პავლე მოციქული და სწორედ ამ აზრის ქომაგად ამბობს ალუდა ამ სიტყვებს. ეს აზრი ძალიან მნიშვნელოვანია, აქ ნათქვამია, ის რომ სხვადასხვა რელიგიის წარმომადგენლები, სხვადასხვა ადათების მქონე ადამიანები არ განირჩევიან მათი რელიგიისა და ადათების მიხედვით. მათაც ისევე ზრდიან დედები როგორც ჩვენ,- ამბობს ალუდა. აქ ხდება ალუდა ამაღლება უფრო მაღალ პრინციპზე გადასვლა „ დაე, დააკლდეს სახელსა, მე გირჩევნივართ მრჩევლადა.“ ანუ მისთვის სახელის პრინციპზე მაღლა დადგა სხვა პრინციპი, რომელიც უფრო მნიშვნელოვანია. ალუდას, რა თქმა უნდა, ვერ გაუგეს, დააბრალეს ლაჩრობა.მინდია საკმაოდ მნიშვნელოვანი ფიგურაა ამ პოემაში, რადგან ის არის ერთადერთი ადამიანი, რომელმაც ასევე უნდა ამოიცნოს ალუდა. (ანაგნორისმოსი) ადამიანი, რომელიც ალუდას შემდეგ დარჩება და იქნება მისი აზროვნების და პარადიგმის გამგრძელებელი.პოემაში ძალიან მნიშვნელოვანია ალუდას სიზმარი. „ალუდას სულიერი მეტამორფოზის სიღრმე და არსი, ის, რომ მისი ძირი იმაშია, რაც მან მუცალთან ორთაბრძოლისას და მუცალის სიკვდილისას განიცადა, ყველაზე მკვეთრად და სრულიად ალუდას სიზმარშია გამჟღავნებული. მუცალი სიზმარში ჩნდება ჭრილობაში ჩაფენილი ბალახით, რაც კიდევ ერთხელ აგრძნობინებს ალუდას, რომ იგი მუცალისთვის სასიკვდილო ტანჯვის მიმყენებელია, მისი სიცოცხლის მომსპობია. ეს გრძნობა რომ აუტანელი სიმძიმით თრგუნავს ალუდას, ამ ხილვაშიც აშკარავდება – მუცალი მას ხელში ხანჯალს უდებს და, როგორც გაწაფული და სისხლმოწყურებული მკვლელისგან, სიკვდილს ითხოვს მისგან.სიზმარში ნანახი მუცალი არსებითად განსხვავდება ნამდვილისგან – რელობაში ,,მუცალს არ სწადის სიკვდილი”, სიცოცხლეს ებღაუჭება და მომაკვდავიც აგრძელებს ბრძოლას, სიზმარში კი იგი თვითონ ეძებს სიკვდილს, რათა სხვებს დაუტოვოს ეს სამყარო – სისხლისღვრის ასპარეზი. ალუდა არამარტო თვითონ განიცდის ზნეობრივ კათარზისს, არამედ მუცალსაც კიდევ უფრო აკეთილშობილებს, ამაღლებს. არ ღირს ისეთ სიცოცხლეზე გამწარებით მოჭიდება, ისეთ სიცოცხლესთან განშორების გამო ტანჯვა, რომლის არსიც კაცისკვლა ანუ არსებითად კაციჭამიობაა – ასეთია მუცალის სიზმრისეული მეტამორფოზის აზრი. მუცალი აქ ალუდას სიღრმისეულ, იდუმალ სათქმელს ამბობს, მისი შინაგანი სამყაროს საუკეთესო საწყისს – სინდისს განასახიერებს.ალუდას სიზმარი დაგვანახებს, რომ ამ ადამინმა თავის თავშივე, თავის არსებაშივე ტანჯვით აღმოაჩინა მცნება ,,არა კაც ჰკლა”. კაცისკვლის საზარელი ცოდვიგან ის ტანჯვით განიწმინდა და კათარზისგამოვლილი განშორდა ამ ცოდვას, თავის ძველ ცხოვრებას.“ ყველასთვის ცხადია, რომ სიზმარი ადამიანის არაცნობიერ სამყაროზე მიგვანიშნებს, იმაზე რასაც ადამიანი ვერ აცნობიერებს და არ იცის. ალუდა ქვეცნობიერადაც წინააღმდეგია მკვლელობის. ადამიანის ძვლიან ხორცს ზიზღით ჭამდა სიზმარში, რაც მიგვანიშნებს იმას, რომ არა მხოლოდ მისი ფიქრები, არამედ მთელი არსება მოიცვა ამ პარადიგმამ და ის მთლიანად დაუპირისიპირდა თემის აზროვნებას. თემი ეკითხება ალუდას რატომ არის ის გაშტერებული. გაშტრება არის შეჩერება, სიმბოლო დაფიქრებისა და განმარტოების.აღსანიშნავია შემდეგი ეპიზოდიც, როცა მინდია მუცალის ხელს მოიტანს, იმის დასტურად რომ ალუდა მართალს ამბობდა. „ - თუ ხელის მაჭრა მდომიყო, გან ვერ მოვსჭრიდი თავადა? ვერ გიქნავ კარგად, მინდიავ, საქმე მოგირთავს ავადა“ ასეთ შეფასებას აძლევს ალუდა მინდიას ქმედებას. „მტერს მოვკლავ, კიდევ არ მოვსჭრი, მარჯვენას მაგათ ჯაბრითა!“ აქ უკვე რადიკალური განხეთქილება იკვეთება, ერთის მხრივ ალუდა, მეორეს მხრივ თემი. მათ შორის „ჯაბრი“ გაჩნდა, გაჩნდა ორი სამყარო, სრულიად სხვა ხედვებითა და წარმოდგენებით. „წესი არ არის მტრის მოკვლა, თუ ხელ არ მასჭერ დანითა, ვაი, ეგეთას სამართალს, მონათლულს ცოდვა-ბრალითა.“ როგორ ხედავს თემი სამართალს? სრულიად განსხვავებულად, თემის აზროვნება უსამართლოა, არაპროგრესული, ისინი არ ფიქრობენ რომ ეს სტერეოტიპები და კლიშეები მათ იმონებს და აბრმავებს, მეტიც, ამ წესის უარყოფა მათ ღალატად მიაჩნიათ.„ეს ვინღა მოდგა ნისლივით, თითბრით ნაზიკის ხმალითა?“ ნისლი აქ იდუმალებას გამოხატავს. თითქოს იდუმალება შემოიპარა ალუდას სახით. ბოლო განხეთქილება თემსა და ალუდას შორის სწორედ ხატობაზე ხდება. როცა ის ბერდიას ეტყვის, რომ კურატს მუცალის სულს სწირავს. „კარგადაც დამიწყალობნე, გამიმეტებაც მისთვინა, როგორც უნდომლად მოკლულის თავის ლამაზის ძმისთვინა.“ როგორც ბატონი ლევან გიგინეიშვილი აღნიშნავს თავის ვიდეო ლექციაში, აქ ალუდა თითქოს მუცალის თვალებიდან უყურებს სამყაროს, ამიტომაც მოიხსენიებს მის ძმას ლამაზად. ალუდა აქაც აწყდება ადათის წინააღმდეგობას. „გაურჯულებულს არჯულებ, შენ ეგ არ შაგიხდებისა“ ეუბნება ბერდია, თუმცა ალუდა მაინც მყარად რჩება საკუთარ არზრზე, მიუხედავად იმისა, რომ ბერდია ახსენებს წარსულს. რამდენჯერ მოუკლავს ქისტი და რამდეჯერ მიუჭედებია მათი ხელები ქავის კარზე. თუმცა ეს აღარ ხდება ალუდასთვის დამაბრკოლებელი ან დამაფიქრებელი იქცევა თუ არა სწორად. მასში ორჭოფობის პროცესი დამთავრებულია, რადგან ყველაფერი სარკვეული აქვს საკუთარ თავთან.„ფერი ედება ბერდიას, ფერი სხვა-რიგის შიშისა.“ სხვა რიგის შიში, ამ შემთხვევაში უფრო კოსმიური შიშია. ალუდას გულწრფელობას მოყვა შუქის ამოხდომა შატილში. ეს მეტაფორული მზე, რომელიც გამოხატავს ნათელი სხივის შემოსვლას შატილში სწორედ ალუდას აზროვნებაა, ალუდას პარადიგმაა, რომლიდანაც მან დაიწყო სამყაროს ყურება. თემი არასდროს აღარ მიიღებს ალუდას, შესაბამისად ვეღარც ალუდა იქნება ისეთივე პატივმოსილი, როგორიც უწინ იყო. თუმცა მას ახლა გააჩნია უმაღლესი პრინციპი, რომელიც ყველაფერზე მაღლა დგას. ესაა თემის გამოღვიძების დასაწყისი.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13423864-three-poems,Three Poems Host and Guest  Aluda Ketelauri  The Snake-Eater.txt

A Little Larger Than the Entire Universe: Selected Poems,"‘What’s the writing of poetry but a confession that life isn’t enough?What’s art but a way to forget that life is just this?’-Álvaro De CamposFernando Pessoa(1888-1935) was a living literary masterpiece. Writing in Portuguese, French, and English, Pessoa turned out a staggering, and seemingly endless collection of poetry, translations, literary criticisms and numerous essays on politics, religion and philosophy, as well as the highly praised and highly ponderousThe Book of Disquiet, all under a vast collection of heteronyms. Coined by Pessoa, Heteronyms are a literary device somewhat like an extension to the concept of a pseudonyms, being fully fleshed-out character, each with their own unique styles, beliefs, and themes as well as a complete biography through which Pessoa wrote as opposed to simply being a false name ¹ Through 81 confirmed heteronyms (the complete list is contained below), Pessoa rocked the literary climate of his native Portugal, being credited as the genius behind the three greatest Portuguese poets of his time: Alberto Caeiro, Álvaro de Campos, Ricardo Reis.Richard Zenith’s introduction to this collection offers an interesting, in-depth look into the life of Pessoa, from his political activism to philosophical musings, and the ideas and inspirations behind the creation of his most famous heteronyms. Pessoa evinced literary greatness very early on in life. writing his first poem at age 7 to his mother:Here I am in PortugalIn the lands where I was born.However much I love themI love you even morespending his early childhood creating fake newspapers for his own enjoyment (written by a fake group of journalists whom he wrote biographies for), and publishing short stories and poems through the heteronym, Charles Robert Anon, at age 16. As Pessoa grew as a writer, he began to create more and more identities to suit his needs. ‘Each of my dreams,’ writes Pessoa as Bernardo Soares inThe Book of Disquiet,as soon as I start dreaming it, is immediately incarnated in another person, who is then the one dreaming it, and not I To create, I’ve destroyed myself…. I’m the empty stage where various actors act out various plays.’ Much like a character actor, Pessoa was able to take on the personality of endless characters, leaving so little trace of himself that people often questioned if it was possible for someone to be able to express one set of opinions and style, yet concurrently write such opposing ideas from another heteronym (although many of the critics debating this or publishing analytical essays on the poets turned out to actually be Pessoa again). Pessoa often experimented with automatic writing to ‘find’ new heteronyms, and after studying heavily into astrology, he began to assign astrological signs to his heteronyms to build their personalities. Zenith collects the ‘best of’ from each of Pessoa’s major poets in this collection to exemplify the diversity and sheer genius of Pessoa.Alberto CaeiroIf they want me to have mysticism, okay, I’ve got it.I’m a mystic, but only in my body,My soul is simple and doesn’t think.My mysticism is not wanting to know.It’s living and not thinking about it.I don’t know what Nature is: I sing her.I live on top of a knollIn a lonely whitewashed house,And that’s my definition.Caeiro, an Aries, was written to be a simple country dweller with no education and a desire to perceive life simply as it is without any thought getting in the way to taint it: ‘to know how to see without thinking, to know how to see when seeing and not think when seeing nor see when thinking’. Born in 1889 and dying in 1915, Caeiro is said by Pessoa to have come to him ‘in a kind of ecstasy’ that allowed him to write the majority of Caeiro’s body of work within a 2 week period.O ship setting out on a distant voyage,Why don't I miss you the way other people doAfter you've vanished from sight?Because, when I don't see you, you cease to exist.And if I feel nostalgia for what doesn't exist,The feeling is in relationship to nothing.It's not the ship but our own selves that we miss.Ricardo ReisI want the flower you are, not the one you give.Why refuse me what I don't ask of you?You'll have time to refuseAfter you've given.Flower, be a flower to me! If, ungenerous, you're pluckedBy the hand of the ill-omened sphinx, you'll wander foreverAs an absurd shadow,Seeking what you never gave.Reis, born in 1887 ², was a physician and immersed in the Greek classics, writing epic, metered odes and sonnets about fate. Reis questions religion (often preferring to believe in the Greek gods than his own Christian faith) mocks man, and seeks only for truth.Whatever ceases is death, and the deathIs ours if it ceases for us. A bushWithers, and with itGoes part of my life.In all I’ve observed, part of me remained.Whatever I’ve seen, when it passes I passed,Memory not distinguishingWhat I’ve seen from what I’ve been.---Let my fate deny me everything exceptto see it, for I, an unstrictStoic, wish to delight in every letterof the sentence engraved by DestinyÁlvaro de CamposI got off the trainAnd said good-bye to the man I’d met.We’d been together for eighteen hoursAnd had a pleasant conversation,Fellowship in the journey,And I was sorry to get off, sorry to leaveThis chance friend whose name I never learned.I felt my eyes water with tears…Every farewell is a death.Yes, every farewell is a deathIn the train that we call lifeWe are all chance events in one another’s lives,And we all feel sorry when it’s time to get off.All that is human moves me, because I am a man.All that is human moves me not because I have an affinityWith human ideas or human doctrinesBut because of my infinite fellowship with humanity itself.The main who hated to go,Crying with nostalgiaFor the house where she’d been mistreated….All of this, inside my heart, is death and the world’s sadness.All of this lives, because it dies, inside my heart.And my heart is a little larger than the entire universe.How amazing is that!?De Campos is my favorite of the heteronyms collected in this book. Born in 1890, De Campos was created to be the antithesis of Pessoa’s true self. Known for writing scathing criticisms, long poems (which later became very short poems in which he expresses sadness for not being able to create the long poems of his youth) and political activism, De Campos has the most personality and public life of the heteronyms. Often Pessoa would show up in character as De Campos to readings or lectures where Pessoa Himself had been scheduled and proceed to bad mouth the Pessoa Himself, which Zenith points out, didn’t always sit well with the public.I’m gonna throw a bomb into destiny.I’m nothing.I’ll never be anything.I can’t wish to be anything.Even so, I have in me all the dreams of the world.Pessoa HimselfThe poet is a fakerWho’s so good at his actHe even fakes the painOf pain he feels in fact.And those who read his wordsWill feel in what he wroteNeither of the pains he hasBut just the one they don’t.And so around its trackThis thing called the heart winds,A little clockwork trainTo entertain our minds.Interestingly enough, Pessoa as himself was the least famous of his major poets. Much of his self poetry is spent discussing the ideas of the ‘self’ and consciousness. He wrote several poems in English, which were only marginally received. As he had taught himself English at a young age by reading his favorite writers, Poe, Shakespeare, Keats, Milton, Arthur Conan Doyle and Dickens among others, his English built itself to have a slightly outdated, stuffy academic feel to it that was noted in many of his English poem reviews. However, it was also mentioned that his Elizabethan style felt extremely authentic.All beauty is a dream, even if it existsfor beauty is always more than it isthe beauty I see in youisn’t here, next to me.What I see in you lives where I dream,Far away from here. If you exist,I only know itBecause I just dreamed it.Beauty is a music which, heardIn dreams, overflowed into life.But it’s not exactly life:It’s the life that dreamed.5/5¹ While most instances of his are simply considered pseudonyms,Søren Kierkegaardhad several heteronyms which he used to distance the opinions in certain books or essays of his from the major body of work.² The idea that Reis continued living after the death of Pessoa is explored in Saramago’s novelThe Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis, in which Lydia, a woman frequently mentioned in Reis poetry, is a significant character.THE LIST OF PESSOA’S HETERONYMS:1.

Yavaş Matematik,"Nazmi Ağıl’dan yeni bir şiir kitabı Yavaş MatematikNazmi Ağıl, kendi şiirini yaratanlardan. Şiir yazma çabası gütmüyor: Şiiri yazıyor. Günlük yaşamdan süzülüp geleni, dibe çöken şiir tortusunu su yüzüne çıkarıveriyor.‘Bundan şiir çıkar mı?’, ‘Böyle şiir mi olur?’ türü kaygıları çoktan geride bırakmış. Sözü, şiirden esirgememeyi öğrenmiş bir kez. Kendi duyarlığı, kendi dili işliyor, yani kendi ipliğiyle örüyor şiirini ama yeri geldikçe gizli-açık selamlar da gönderiyor başka şiirlere.Yeni bir şiirin peşinde değil Nazmi Ağıl, özgün sesinin yankısında... Bir şiir mekiği, kendi durakları arasında durmaksızın işliyor.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26003884-yava-matematik,Yavaş Matematik.txt
Hançer,"____Kitaplardaki alt çizme aracım Stabilo Luminator portakal rengi. Fiyatı 35 tl; sağlam kazık yani. Yöntemim romanlarda satırların altını çizmek ve bu satırların bulunduğu sayfanın üst köşesini kalemle işaretlemek. Çok kısa öykü ve şiirlerde ise beğendiğim şiirin sadece başlangıç sayfasının sağ ya da sol üst köşesini bu forsforlu kalemle boyamak. Kitabı elinize alınca yukardan hangi sayfalar işaretlenmiş hemen anlaşılıyor. Tıraşı kesip bu kitaba gelirsek, ilk önce elime aldım fosforluyu ama her şiiri işaretlemek gerekince anlamını yitirdi. Bu yüzden bıraktım ben de. Tamamen müthiş şiirlerle dolu bir kitap. Anlatmam zor. Ayrıca çevirmen de, o eski meseleyi, şiirin çeviride kaybolmasını en aza indirmeyi başarmış sanırım. Kesinlikle alın okuyun.____Kitabı bitirmeden yazdığım yukarıdaki yorumlara eklemem gereken bir şey var. Kitabın ikinci kısmı sayılacak bir bölümünde iki tane şiir-düzyazı gibi iki manzume var. İkisi de birbirinden dandik ve sıkıcı, cidden çekilmez bir şey. Şiirler iyi ama bu manzuma denen zırvalar berbat. Onları hiç katmıyorum.

Yalnızlık Tanımları,"Egemen Berköz (1941) Karadeniz Ereğli doğumlu. 1959’dan başlayarak dönemin önde gelen dergilerinde şiirleri yayımlanan Berköz, ilk şiir kitabı olan Çin Askeri Ah Devran’ı 1966 yılında yayımladı. Bunu Yalnızlıklar! Yalnızlıklar! (1977) ve Bu Kitapta Sen Nerdesin? (1981) izledi. Özellikle, üçüncü kitabında yer alan “Son Üç Günün Hikâyesi” adlı düzyazı şiir; “hem korkunç bir umuda hem acılı bir öfkeye” açılan “rüzgârlı” içeriği, hüznü ve yalnızlığı imleyen vurgusuyla şairin poetikasının kilit taşı olarak nitelendi. 2016 yılında Behçet Necatigil 100. Yıl Şiir Emek Ödülü’ne, 2017 yılında ise PEN Türkiye Şiir Ödülü’ne değer görülen Berköz’ün Nobel Edebiyat Ödülü sahibi Salvatore Quasimodo’dan yaptığı çevirilerden oluşan Ve Birden Akşam, 2019 yılında Ayrıntı şiir dizisinden yayımlandı. Egemen Berköz, “Unutma!” çağrısını, kırk yıl sonra yayımladığımız yeni kitabı Yalnızlık Tanımları’nda da sürdürüyor. Doğan Hızlan’ın deyişiyle, Berköz’ün “inadına unutmamak” üzerine kurulu zamanı algılama, yaşama ve yazma tavrı, yaşamdan izdüşümler, gün dökümleri ve anımsayışlar olarak kitap bütününde izlenebiliyor. Berköz; 1968’den, bir zamanların Ereğli’sinden kalanları, artık olmayanları, Doğduğu Ev’i, Dönme Melek Hanım Teyze’yi, Gülüç Çayırı’nı konuk ediyor şiirine; lodosla poyrazla savrulup durulmuş bir ömrün hikâyesine gönderiyor bizi.

(რუსთაველი, გვ.34)მიუხედავად იმისა, რომ მხოლოდ მეფემ და ავთანდილმა ნახეს უცხო მოყმე, ამ ამბით ძალიან სერიოზულად არის დაინტერესებული თინათინი. ჩემი აზრით, სწორედ ესაა ფილოსოფიური ინტერესი, შემეცნების სურვილი. შემეცნების სურვილში ყოფნა ძალიან აზარტულია, რომ არა თინათინის ეს ვნება, ეს მუხტი ავთანდილს საერთოდაც არ ექნებოდა და ვხედავთ, რომ ამ დავალების მიღების შემდეგაც არ უჩნდება. ძალიან ნათლად ჩანს, რომ ეს მუხტი ავთანდილს არ აქვს და ეს არც არის გასაკვირი. ის ჯარების მთავარსარდალია, თუმცა შემეცნების ინტერესი ზოგადად ყველანაირ პროფესიასა და საქმიანობის საზღვარს სცდება (ნუ უნდა სცდებოდეს მაინც).რასაც თინათინი აკეთებს, ესაა სრული თავმიძღვნა ფილოსოფიისადმი, რადგან ის ამ ყველაფრისთვის სიყვარულს რისკავს. სასწორზე დებს ორ მნიშვნელოვან რამეს: მიჯნურობასა და ფილოსოფიას. სწორედ თინათინია მაპროვოცირებელი შემდგომ განვითარებული მოვლენებისა. ავთანდილი იღებს ამ გამოწვევას იმის გამო, რომ ის მიჯნურია, მას თინათინი უყვარს და სწორედ ამიტომ მიდის უცხო მოყმის მოსაძებნად და არა იმიტომ, რომ ის თინათინის ფილოსოფიურ ინტერესს იზიარებს. ავთანდილი წავიდა უცხო მოყმის მოსაძებნად. აქ ავტორი ამბობს:“გამოემართა ავთანდილ მოყმე მხნე, ლაღად მავალი.ოც დღე იარა, ღამეცა დღეს ზედა წართო მრავალიიგია ლხინი სოფლისა, იგია ნივთი და ვალი.არ მისცილდების თინათინ მისი მას, ვისგან სწვავ ალი.” (გვ.36)აქედან გამომდინარე შემეცნების გზაზე პირველ ფაზად ანუ ყველაფრის საწყისად ავთანდილისთვის შეიძლება ჩაითვალოს პოტენცია. ავთანდილმა მიიღო გამოწვევა და მას საკუთარი თავი ჰყავს როგორც პოტენცია. ახლა რა გამოიძერწება და რა გამოვა ამ პოტენციიდან თავად მასზეა დამოკიდებული.შესაძლოა ითქვას, რომ ავთანდილი ძალით წავიდა, ამიტომაც ამბობს, ჩემი აზრით, ავტორი: “ვარდი მის მზისა გაყრილი უფრო და უფრო ჭნებოდა”. შესაძლებლობა იმისა, რომ ის ამაღლდეს ინტერესის ტელოსამდე უფრო შეამცირა უიმედოდ ძებნამ, ის ფიქრობს, საკუთარ თავს ესაუბრება, მიმართავს ღმერთს, გმობს წუთისოფლის სიმუხთლეს. ავთანდილი ძებნას წყვეტს და საკუთარ თავთან მოლაპარაკების შემდეგ გადაწყვეტს, რომ უკან დაბრუნდეს. თუმცა სინამდვილეში საკუთარ თავთან დიალოგი სწორედ ის ვიწრო და რთული ბილიკია, რომელიც შეიძლება ადამიანს რაღაც ძალიან მნიშვნელოვანისკენ გაუძღვეს. სწორედ რაციონალური მონოლოგისთვის ჯილდოვდება ავთანდილი, როდესაც მას სამი ძმა შეხვდება. ის უცხო მოყმის ამბავს შეიტყობს და აქ კიდევ ერთხელ ჩნდება იმედი “ვითა მე მივხვდი წადილსა, ჩემი გულისა ნებასა”. ავთანდილი მალევე დაეწევა უცხო მოყმეს თან გზაში საკუთარ თავს ესაუბრება. მან იქამდე სდია უცხო მოყმეს, სანამ ის გამოქვაბულს არ მიადგა. ავთანდილი ამჯობინებს, რომ მოშორებით დაიცადოს, ვიდრე ასმათი მარტო არ დარჩება. აქ ძალიან საინტერესო რამ ხდება. გავიხსენოთ რას ეუბნება თინათინი ავთანდილს, მას არ უთქვამს უცხო მოყმის ამბავი და ვინაობა გაეგო რატომ ტიროდა ან როსტევანის სამეფოში რა უნდოდა... თინათინმა უთხრა, რომ მას ეპოვნა უცხო მოყმე იმისთვის, რომ შეეტყო ნამდვილად არსებობდა თუ არა ის.ავთანდილმა პირწმინდად შეასრულა დაკისრებული მოვალეობა, მან იპოვნა უცხო მოყმე და რეალურად სწორედ აქ უნდა დასრულებულიყო ეს მისია, დაბრუნებულიყო თინათინთან, ეცნობებინა უცხო მოყმის არსებობის ამბავი და ეცხოვრათ მშვიდად და ბედნიერად. თუმცა აქ სხვა რამ ხდება, სწორედ ისეთი რამ, რაც მაფიქრებინებს, რომ ავთანდილი ფილოსოფიურ ინტერესს კიდევ მეტად მიუახლოვდა და ახლა სულ სხვა მოტივით მოქმედებს, სწორედ ამ ინტერესით. ავთანდილი აზარტშია, უკვე გაუჩნდა საკუთრი სურვილი და აღარ მოქმედებს თინათინის ვალის მოტივით. უკვე თავად აინტერესებს გაიგოს ვინ არის ეს კაცი, რომელიც ამდენ ადამიანს ხოცავს, თან ტირის, თან სადღაც გამოქვაბულში ცხოვრობს. მას უკვირს ის სურათიც, რისი მომსწრეც გახდა. “ავთანდილ სჭვრეტს გაკვირვებით მათსა ეგრე ქცევა-ზმასა.” (გვ. 47) ქალი და კაცი ერთმანეთს ეხვევიან და თან ტირიან. ამაში კიდევ უფრო მეტად დიდი ინტრიგა დევს ავთანდილისთვის, თუმცა კულმინაცია იმისა, რომ ავთანდილი სრულად ჩავარდა თინათინივით ფილოსოფიურ ინტერესში მაინც სხვაგანაა...ამ ინტერესმა უკვე გადააწყვეტინა, შევიდეს გამოქვაბულში და ქალს უცხო ყმის ამბავი მოაყოლინოს. თუმცა ქალი ჯიუტია, ამბავს არ ყვება და ამბობს, რომ ეს ამბავი ვერც დაიწერება და ვერც მოიყოლება. ეს კიდევ უფრო მეტად აინტრიგებს ავთანდილს, იმდენად, რომ ხან ძალადობის ხერხს მიმართავს, ხან კი-პირიქით, უკიდურესად დამცირებულად წარმოაჩენს თავს, ატირდება მუხლებზე დაიჩოქრებს და ისე ეხვეწება ასმათს ამბის თხრობას. ამ ეპიზოდში ავთანდილი მიჯნურობას ახსენებს, და ერთგვარად იტყუება კიდევაც, რადგან ჩვენ, მკითხველებმა უკვე ვიცით მისი ვალი სად დასრულდა. სწორედ ამ ეპიზოდშიც ჩანს, რომ ეს მისი პირადი ინტერესია და არა თინათინის.გამოდის, რომ თინათინმა ავთანდილი არა საკუთარი ინტერესების დასაკმაყოფილებლად გაგზავნა, არამედ მისი თავისკენ ისროლა, მისი ინტერესებისკენ, ახლის ძიებისკენ, თავგადასავლისკენ, რომელიც ავთანდილს სხვა გამოცდილებას შესძენდა და სხვანაირად დააფორმირებდა. თუმცა უნდა ითქვას, რომ ავთანდილის როლი ამაში დიდი იყო, ის რომ არ ყოფილიყო ამდენად გამტარი, ინტელექტუალური და ღია ახალი გამოწვევებისთვის, ამბის შეტყობისთანავე უკან გაბრუნდებოდა. ჩვენ ვხედავთ, როგორი დადებითი მუხტი და ინერცია შეიძინა ავთანდილმა. ამ დადებითი ინერციის საპასუხოდ და სტრატეგიული განსჯის წყალობით ავთანდილს საქმე გამოუვა.“იმა მოყმისა ამბავი არსადა არ იპოვნების;თვით თუ არ გითხრობს, არ ითქმის, არვისგან დაიჯერების;მოილოდინე, მოვიდეს, რაზომცა დაგეყოვნების,დადუმდი, ვარდსა ნუ აზრობ, ცრემლითა ნუ ითოვნების.” (გვ.53)ამ ეპიზოდიდან ჩანს, რომ ავთანდილი და ასმათი მოკავშირეები გახდნენ. ავთანდილმა კი რაღაც დიდ ცოდნაში უნდა შეაბიჯოს. აქ იწყება მზაობა ამ ამბის შესატყობად და აქ ავთანდილი კიდევ ერთხელ ჭკვიანურად იტყუება. “მიბრძანა: <<მიცან ამბავი მის ყმისა წახდომილისა” (გვ.58) ცრუობს ის. ვითომ თინათინმა უბრძანა უცხო მოყმის ამბის შეტყობა. ეს კიდევ ერთი არგუმენტია იმისა, რომ ის უკვე საკუთარი ინტერესით მოქმედებს. ეს ის ინტერესია, რა ინტერესიც თინათინს ამოძრავებდა.“ამა დღემან დამავიწყა, გული ჩემი ვინ დაბინდა;დამიგდია სამსახური მისი, იქმნას რაცა გინდა;იაგუნდი ეგრეცა სჯობს, ათასჯერცა მინა მინდა,შენ გეახლო სიკვდილამდის, ამის მეტი არა მინდა!”სწორედ აქ ჩანს ყველაზე დიდი ინტერესი და თავდადება, მზაობა მოისმინოს ტარიელის ამბავი.როდესაც ტარიელი მას საკუთარ ამბავს უამბობს, ავთანდილისთვის საკუთარ სამშობლოში დაბრუნების დრო დგება. პირველ ჯერზე დაბრუნებას შერმადინს ახარებს, შემდგომ როსტევან მეფეს და ბოლოს-თინათინს. აქ საინტერესოა ავთანდილისა და თინათინის დიალოგი. მათ საუბარში იგრძნობა, რომ მორალურად და ინტელექტუალურად თინათინი და ავთანდილი ერთ საფეხურზე დგანან, რადგან აქ როლები უკვე გაიცვალა. ავთანდილი ამბობს, რომ ის ტარიელთან უნდა დაბრუნდეს, რათა მოყვარეს დაეხმაროს. ნათელია, რომ ამ ეპიზოდში ინიციატორი უკვე ტარიელია, და არა-თინათინი. ინიციატივა კი ტარიელის დახმარებაა. თინათინ პასუხობს:“შენ არ-გატეხა კარგი გჭირს ზენაარისა, ფიცისა.ხამს გასრულება მოყვრისა სიყვარულისა მტკიცისა,ძებნა წამლისა მისისა და ცოდნა ხამს უიცისა,ჩემი თქვი, რა ვქმნა ბნელ-ქმნილმან, მზე მიმეფაროს მი-, ცისა?” (გვ.140)თინათინი ეთანხმება ავთანდილს, რომ მიცემული ფიცი ავთანდილმა არ უნდა გატეხოს. ეს თანხმობის ეპიზოდი, ძალიან ჰარმონიზებულია, არ არსებობს არც ერთი გაუგებარი კითხვა ან შემჩნევა. თინათინი არ კითხულობს უცხო მოყმის ამბავს, რადგან აქ მთავარი რაც იყო, ის უკვე გამორკვეულია. ჩემი აზრით, მთავარი კულმინაცია, როცა ავთანდილი თინათინივით შემეცნების სიყვარულში გადაეშვა ტარიელის მონათხრობის დასრულების შემდეგ, საკუთარ მიჯნურთან შეყრით და ამ ჰარმონიით დაგვირგვინდა. აქ ავთანდილი წარმოგვიდგება ისეთივე გაზრდილი და ინიციატივის მქონდე, როგორიც თინათინია.აქედან გამომგინარე, მე ვფიქრობ, რომ ამ პოემის მთავარი ეროსი არა მინჯურობა, არამედ შემეცნების სიყვარულია, ანუ ის ფილოსოფიური ინტერესი, რომელსაც თავდაპირველად თინათინი იჩენს, ხოლო შემდეგ ავთანდილიც იმუხტება ამ ინტერესით. სწორედ ეს ინტერესი გასდევს მთელ პოემას მამოძრავებელ ძალად, თითქოს ეს არის ძრავი, რომლის ენერგიითაც ყველა შემდეგი ამბავი “მუშაობს” და იმუხტება. რა თქმა უნდა, ამ პოემას სხვა ბევრი სათქმელიც აქვს, თუმცა მგონია, რომ ეს ერთ-ერთი ყველაზე მნიშვნელოვანი სათქმელთაგანია, რადგან შემეცნების სიყვარულმა და ძიებამ შესაძლოა ძალიან დიდი ძვრები გამოიწვიოს ადამიანის მორალურ, ზნეობრივ და სხვა

Sovyet Şairleri Antolojisi,"Sovyet şiiri, Attilâ Tokatlı'nın da belirttiği üzere, 20. yüzyıl dünya edebiyatının en orijinal ve zengin unsurlarından biridir ve 20. yüzyıl dünya edebiyatına etkisi, Fransız şiirinden aşağı değildir. Ancak Mayakovski, Puşkin, Yevtuşenko gibi birkaç şair haricinde ülkemizde Sovyet şiirinin pek de fazla bilindiğini iddia edemeyiz. 70'e yakın şairin, biyografileri ve şiirlerinden örneklerle yer aldığı antolojinin, bu açığı kapatmakta önemli bir rol üstleneceğini düşünüyoruz. Bir Puşkin şiirinin Nazım Hikmet çevirisi ile yer alması, Sovyet Türkoloğu Lel Starostov'un iki çevirisi gibi kimi sürprizler de var kitapta okurları bekleyen.Şiirseverler, Sovyet şiirini daha iyi tanımak isteyenler için bu antoloji temel bir başvuru kaynağı niteliğindedir.Antoloji 'de Yer Alan Şairler:Aleksandr PuşkinVladimir Solovievİnnokenti AnnenskiFedor SologubViaçeslav İvanovKonstantin Balmonİvan BuninValeri BriussovMaksimilyen VoloşinAndrey BeliyAleksandr BlokSaşa ÇerniAleksey GastevDemyan BedniVelimir HlebnikovAleksey KruçyonikNikola GumilevSamuel Marşakİgor SeveryaninNikolay KluievAnna AhmatovaVladimir KirillovNikola AsseevStepan ÇipaçovBoris Pasternakİlya EhrenburgOsip MandelştamVera İnberMarina TsvetaevaVladimir MayakovskiSergey YeseninEduar BagritskiPavel AntokolskiNikolay TikonovAleksandr BezimenskiAleksey Surkovİlya SelvinskiMihail İsakovskiİvan İvanoviç DoroninVladimir LugovskoyMihail SvetlovYosif Pavloviç UtkinVasili KazinLeonid MartinovSemyon KirsanovOlga BergoltsAleksandr TvardovskiSergey Mihalkovİsrovlav SmelyakovKonstantin SimonovMargarita AligerPavel KoganBoris SlutskiBoris SmolenskiSemyon GudzenkoVsevolod BagritskiYevgeni VinokurovRober RojdestvenskiYevgeni YevtuşenkoAndrey VoznesenskiViktor SosnoraBella Ahmadulina GussievMustav KerimYuri PankratonOkucava(Tanıtım Bülteninden)",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18250389-sovyet-airleri-antolojisi,Sovyet Şairleri Antolojisi.txt
In hora mortis,"In hora mortisè una collezione di poesie che richiama gliSterbrbuchlein, un trattato dedicato al giusto modo di affrontare l'ora estrema - l'ars moriendi, dove morire è inteso come l'incontro dell'uomo con Dio. Lo scopo di tali opere era di preparare l'uomo alla morte attraverso un processo religioso suddiviso in quattro parti:exortationes,interrogationes,orationeseobservationes. Inin hora mortis, Bernhard riprende la suddivisione in quattro sezioni numerate, contenenti ciascuna brevi segmenti lirici. Nella prima parte prevale il tema della rabbia, dell'agonia dell'esistenza; nella seconda parte coglie un senso di liberazione nella morte; nella terza la invoca e, infine, accetta come un dono nella quarta.Nelle ripetizioni (la parola [Signore] compare cinquantasei volte) e nelle ripetute metafore riecheggia il linguaggio biblico, sfruttato in più occasioni come elemento ritmico. Sorvolando la costante autoesibizione,In hora mortisoffre immagini appartenenti sostanzialmente al mondo contadino, scagliate in una dimensione notturna tutt'altro che rassicurante e affiorano accenni di denuncia sociale e alla violenza della storia.Anche in questa composizione si afferma il primato del materiale fonetico, la poesia interpretata come fraseggio musicale.L'arte del morire è un'arte musicale.Una collezione a mio avviso più complessa diSotto il ferro della lunama che, grazie aL'ARTE DELL'«ARS MORIENDI»a cura di Luigi Reitani (da cui ho più volte preso spunto durante la stesura della recensione), diventa molto più comprensibile e godibile a una seconda o terza lettura.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17127613-in-hora-mortis,In hora mortis.txt
Syllabus: Notes from an Accidental Professor,"I heard about this book when I listened to theCreative Mom podcast. This is not normally my kind of book, but I really enjoyed it. I was also very taken with the profound insights into the creative process and nurturing creativity. The book is taken from a curriculum from one ofLynda Barry's classes and the content still has those qualities. I liked Barry's idea of a curriculum, clear standards for the class that had more to do with production than perfect drawing. My favorite thing about this book is that it conveys the message that I was trying to convey with theCreative Prompt Project:Just draw (or paint or sculpt or dance) and don't worry if it looks imperfect or childish. Experience the act of making something with your hands/body.The book looks like a composition notebook, one of those black and white marbled notebooks seen in massive stacks at stores during the back-to-school season. Barry uses very humble materials. They are not low quality, but humble -- crayons (pg.87), non-photo blue pencil (), Flair felt pen (). The title page and verso are not very obvious at all, which caught me, as a librarian, off guard. There is no table of contents and no index. The text just starts with the question ""Is Creative Concentration Contagious?"" There is a method to the seeming madness, however, and the book includes a story about the class Lynda Barry taught.As I wrote the review, I wanted to go back and read all the pages over again. There is so much to see on the pages, I think it is possible to get something new no matter how many times you look at the pages. One part I cannot get out of my head is something I knew, but could never put into words. I was very glad when Lynda Barry wrote it down for me. ""We know that athletes, musicians, and actors all have to practice, rehearse, repeat things until it gets into the body, the 'muscle memory', but for some reason, writers and visual artists think they have to be inspired before they make something not suspecting the PHYSICAL ACT of writing or drawing is what brings that inspiration about. Worrying about its worth and value before it exists can keep us immobilized forever. Any story we write or picture we made cannot demonstrate its worth until we write it or draw it. The answer can't come to us any other way"" (pg.163)There are a lot of slightly scary (I am not a horror person) and disturbing images in this book; a lot of the images are dark. This books is probably not appropriate for 5 year olds, but is perfectly fine for the tween to adult set. Also, it is a good reminder that not all drawings (or quilts or other artworks) are pretty in a conventional sense. This does not diminish other aspects of the piece (pg.29). The encouragement to just be creative regularly is the point.The book discusses drawing a lot - not theoretical aspects, but the sheer magnitude of work the students are expected to create. Yes, you get better the more you practice, but you also have an ""experience by hand"" (pg.31), which has value. Barry writes ""...what if the way kids draw -- that kind of line that we call 'childish' -- what if that is what a lines looks like when someone is having an experience by hand?"" (pg.31). When I work, there is definitely something I gain by having fabric in my hands. It may be because my paid work is just stuff appearing on a screen while my quiltmaking is more of a whole body experience.There is so much that translates directly to quiltmaking; I almost couldn't take it all in. ""I told them to color had in order to do it right. And go straight to use force -- thinking I was showing them a short-cut -- this took way the way of coloring they would have found on their own. By telling them just how to do it, I took the playing-around away, the gradual figuring out that bring something alive to the activity, makes it worthwhile, and is transferrable [sic] to other activities."" (pg.89) I love this passage. It makes me wonder if there is joy in using quilt patterns. Sure you have a quilt when you finish, but did the making of a design that someone else has already made bring joy to the quiltmaker?There are random and very interesting facts scattered throughout the book. ""Every baby old enough to hold a crayon can already use and understand these 3 languages. Sometimes all at once."" (pg.14). She is talking about the relationship between pictures, music and dancing. This struck me as really amazing. She also talks about the relationship between hands, images and insights referring to using what is at hand to make art. One example is a child in bed interacting with his/her blanket as if it were alive. Another example is a of a homeless man acting out Romeo and Juliet with a cigarette butt and bottle cap as the main characters. (pg.15). This section is too insightful to include quotes, which is why you should read this book. ;-)One good reminder (pg.19) is that even though we don't like a piece of our artwork, it survives. This reminds me of finishing a quilt and being very glad to be done with it. Still, six months later, the quilt is one of my best. It is a good thing to remember that our work survives even if we don't like it. Barry also states ""Liking and not liking can make us blind towhat's there."" (pg.23). I make no secret of not liking brown and having a hard time appreciating Civil War reproduction fabrics. Some years ago, I forced myself to look more carefully at some of these types of quilts in order to appreciate the piecing and the design. while I have a hard time imagining such quilts in brights and dots, I can appreciate intricate and exact piecing.The book is filled with tips, many of which dovetail with what I am trying to do with my blog. One states ""I know if I can just keep them drawing without thinking about it too much, something quite original will appear..."" (pg.21). I think it is very important to keep working, even if you make a lot of crap, because at some point, something great will happen that wouldn't have happened if you hadn't done so much mediocre or okay work. One tip is to use smaller spaces. Lynda has her students fold 8.5""x11"" sheets of paper into 16 squares and use those for their drawings. Friend Julie is making small square quilts as an exercise. Is this something that would jolt my creativity?Words in the book described as tips become profound when I think about them. One such group of words is something that I tried to espouse in theCreative Prompt Project. ""Daily practice with images both written and drawn israreonce we have lost our baby teeth and begin to think of ourselves asgoodat some things andbadat other things. It's not that this isn't TRUE but the side effects are profound once we abandon a certain activity like drawing because we are bad at it. A certain state of mind (what McGilchrist might call 'attention') is also lost. A certain capacity of the mind is shuttered and for most people, it stays that way for life"" (pg.115). This quote, idea hits close to home. I know I do it. It is easier to do things I am good at. I don't do needle-turn applique' because it is hard and I have to work at it. I want the time I spend to mean something more than ravelly edges on a piece of applique'. Still, what am I losing with this attitude?One aspect of the ideas in the text that really struck me was about images. Lynda Barry writes ""I was trying to understand how images travel between people, how they move through time, and if there was a way to use writing and picture making to figure out more about how images work. (pg.49) This idea has been rumbling around in my head, including related to quiltmaking. We know that newspapers used to print patterns. We know that ladies would trade patterns. Now we have digital cameras and record quilt images that way. Still, we see images and they rumble around in our heads, morph and change before they become a quilt. Even when they become a quilt, changes are still possible.The other thing about this book is the author encourages us to notice things. The composition book acts as a life note book. She encourages a small box to record things students did, saw, heard and then there is a space for a daily drawing. ""what goes into your diary are things that you noticed when you became present -- that is to say when the hamster wheel of thoughts and plans and worries stopped long enough for you to notice where you were and what was going on around you -- little things..."" (pg.61). This happens to me when I walk and am not listening to a book. This book makes me think I should do that more often.Partway through the text, Barry writes ""sometimes right before class I'll see students rushing to finish the homework I gave them and I always feel sad. They'll get nothing from the work without the state of mind that comes with it. It's a thing Dan Chaon calls 'Dreaming Awake' - we can use writing and drawing to get to that state, but not by rushing"" (pg.128). I think I get to this state when I am piecing a lot of the same types of pieces. It allows me to accomplish something in the quiltmaking world while my mind wanders off to other places to solve other problems. I don't think we have enough of this type of time. While I like to have a basic plan in place when I start a quilt, often I just want to try something and that ends up as a quilt, like the Swoon did. I think there was an element of this type of working in the IRR as well. Lynda talks about this when she says ""It's a kind of picturing that is formed by our own activity, one line suggesting the next. We have a general direction but can't see where we are until we let ourselves take a step, and then another, and then we move on to the third""(pg.136). There is an element of uncertainty when working this way, but also an element of excitement, because the maker does not know exactly where s/he is going.Fixed places are a concept I cannot completely wrap my head around, but if what I think the author is talking about is true, I can identify at least one group of fixed places relevant to my life. Lynda B writes ""Poets claim that we recapture for a moment the self that we were long ago when we enter some house or garden in which we used to live in our youth. But these are most hazardous pilgrimages, which end as often in disappointment as in success. It is in ourselves that we should rather seek to find thosefixed places, contemporaneous with different years"" (pg.181). I wonder how fixed places affect our lives. The point about failure and success is well taken. You can't go back and we do look back on the past with rose colored glasses and forget the difficult parts.Finally, Ms. Barry talks about journals. Journals, as you know, are near and dear to my heart. I have kept one for years and she gives voice to my thoughts on journals and writing in a journal when she says 'the nature of notetaking by hand. Thinking of one's compbook as aplace. The practice of developing aplacenot athing"" (pg.194). For me, a journal is a place to think. It can be a mess. If you force yourself to make it beautiful it might be less useful. For me, it is less useful if I have to make my daily journal a gorgeous visual journal. I need a place to dump and my daily journal is that place.Towards the end of this 200 page book, Barry tells a story ""He said that during those years, as a child, he used to imagine that he was the son of the emperor of China, and the old, wise advisors of his father set a spell on him: he would have to experience all these terrible events so when he grew up and became the emperor himself, he would not make war.Since, I stopped thinking that art is decoration in life; for me, it is proof that art is essential to our surviving."" (pg.173). Using creativity to survive a terrible situation is so clever that I cannot think how this author thought of it except that he practiced and it was second nature.I guess the thing about this book that I liked best was that it made me think in a different way. Barry's book gives me a lot to think about. It made me wonder if I can to do more to develop my creativity? Practice more? Draw more? Dance more? Walk more without headphones and an audiobook? Allow my mind to wander? There is a lot in what I have written in this review, but there is so much more. Go buy thisbook(shameless plug!!) and read it.

StallingsThis translation begins beautifully, which initially made me keen to read the rest of it.Life-stirring Venus, Mother of Aeneas and of Rome,Pleasure of men and gods, you make all things beneath the domeOf sliding constellations teem, you throng the fruited earthAnd the ship-freighted sea – for every species comes to birthConceived through you, and rises forth and gazes on the light.The winds flee from you, Goddess, your arrival puts to flightThe clouds of heaven. For you, the crafty earth contrives sweet flowers,For you, the oceans laugh, the skies grow peaceful after showers,Awash with light. For soon as morning wears the face of spring,And the West Wind is free and freshens, warm and quickening,The airy tribe of birds, O Holy One, is first to startHeralding your approach, struck with your power through the heart;Then beasts, the wild and tame alike, go romping over the lushPastureland and swim across the rivers’ headlong rush…This may be somewhat misleading if you've never read the poem before - indeed, Richard Jenkyns in the introduction calls the beginning ""the most magnificent and spectacular act of worship in classical Latin literature"". But it's also a great example of how the atheist Epicurean Lucretius thinks it's entirely valid to use the gods in metaphor and artistic imagery whilst also repudiating their existence on a factual level. And how well he writes that imagery (and Stallings too).That metre: ""Fourteeners ... widely used in the sixteenth century by English translators of Latin tragedy and epic, who seem to have considered it the native equivalent of the classical hexameter""(Stallings). I love a historically appropriate choice like this.I hadn't seriously thought of reading Lucretius before this year, but in two different works about Machiavelli - William Landon's Great Courses lecture seriesBooks that Matter: The Prince, and Alexander Lee's big new biography,Machiavelli: His Life & Times(2020), plus a few other papers, it had become clear that Lucretius is now seen as an important influence. (Machiavelli being a topic I was landed with at university twenty years ago, and have always felt I had unfinished business with due to not doing much work on him at the time.) Meanwhile, over 100 years after Machiavelli, Sir Thomas Browne, even more cautious in matters of religion, had advised ""avoid reading too much Lucretius, “there being divers impieties in it, and ’tis no credit to be punctually versed in it”,"" I read this summer in the introduction to the NYRBReligio Medici & Urne Buriall. I looked at two or three of the most popular recent Lucretius translations, and this one in particular seemed lovely.The Nature of Things- an epic poem about atheism and science - is a fantastic idea, and in the historical context, a subversive one. There must be a lot of people out there who would love it, but who've probably never thought of it as something they might read.For me, there were two major obstacles which made it a slog at times. I usually love epic poems, but I overall found this one heavier-going than any I've read. (A friend suggested to me in August that news might put me off starting it: Boris Johnson had publicly talked about Lucretius as his summer reading, but I am - in Epicurean style - currently keeping away from news and politics to the extent that I still don't know anything more about this, which edition(s) he read, what he thought of it etc, and for the moment don't care to.)Firstly, whilst there are quite a few statements I agree with inThe Nature of Things, and arguments that are reasonable, I do have a sense of something missing, and I especially noticed that at times when I'd just been listening to theRig Vedaon audio. It feels to me like ancient poetry and spirituality go together and that it's strange without the latter, an idea I'm sure would have exasperated Lucretius. He does occasionally include god metaphors and lovely descriptions of natural phenomena, from Brownian motion to charismatic megafauna, and adorable images like ""flocks of stars grazing their way across the night sky"". Evidently he is showing that the world can still be wondrous without religious belief and through scientific fact - much as Richard Dawkins would assert two millenia later inUnweaving the Rainbow. ""Here is the deepest reason why Lucretius’ philosophy must be poetry also,"" says Jenkyns. ""You cannot command a person into a feeling"".And then I have never got on very well with old non-fiction. As I think I've said in an earlier review, this was always a secret shame of mine when I was studying history, and likewise later, with psychology I never had any inclination to read a book of Freud cover to cover, although I knew from recent publications how indebted certain areas of modern psychology are to him (including the currently buzzy field of trauma), and that those who still assume all of Freud is 1-star hogwash are misinformed. I love social history, the history of popular culture and customs - and I'm very interested to hear summaries of old theories and beliefs in secondary sources. But ploughing through hundreds of pages of science from hundreds of years ago, at least half of it now superseded, has never been my idea of fun for some reason. The notes in this edition of Lucretius could also have been more helpful in explaining what modern knowledge is on some of his theories, as a lot of its readers, especially in the UK - where education specialises earlier - won't have studied physics beyond the age of 16, if even that far. There were various points on which I knew the correct/modern take, but on several was not sure, especially in the first half, and I won't be alone in that.Yet I'm currently enthralled by the details of everyday late medieval life in a modern version ofPiers Plowman, a text I understand bores a lot of Eng Lit students - and I'm sure there are readers out there who would feel similarly about the Roman science inThe Nature of Things. A lot of it is astoundingly correct and perceptive, especially considering they didn't have microscopes - and other bits are just plain wrong but understandably so (oh, but beasts did ""crawl from briny pools to land"" as part of evolution), or weirdly wrong. (Among the latter: Why, if one has observed that shadows occur because light is blocked, then assume that the darkness of night is because of particles of darkness? If making other correct deductions about how the body worked from injuries to parts of it, injuries that were evidently more often seen by the public in the grisly Roman world than now, how did they not conclude that the head was the seat of the mind?) If you find that sort of primary-source history of science interesting, you should read this - and as it's rather a modern translation and short it'll be easier than ploughing through Newton or similar.Though there are details of Roman life inThe Nature of Thingsin metaphors and analogies. Having read theOdysseyearlier this year, and seen how background details show nature as wilder and closer, and a world of small chiefdoms, it was evident in Lucretius how much more urbanised and technological the Romans were. Different enough that it seemed a little odd to be tagging both as 'Classical antiquity' when I have 'medieval' and 'early modern' separate - but then I've never specialised in the Classical world. There are lions in both - but in Lucretius the lions might be caged, as if for the arena. Yet Romans - at least the readership Lucretius expected - had considerably more knowledge of nature than the average 21st century Westerner; he can refer to wild plants assuming the reader will know their scent:Take anything that breathes forth from its flesh a pungent smell –Heal-all, loathsome wormwood, overpowering lad’s-love, fellCentaury – and then lightly pinch it with your thumb and fingerFor the non-Classicist, it's perhaps easy to forget how lively and lived-in Roman buildings once were. Not after this:Dizzy children think the columns in a peristyleAre going round, and that the entire court is in a spin,Once they themselves stop turning, so that they almost beginTo believe the house threatens to tumble in about their ears.And a reference to ""the overwhelming fumes of charcoal"" reminded me of how medieval people disliked coal and its smoke (there was legislation against burning it in London) before its use became inevitable due to wood shortage and population growth.In contrast with the Roman-ness is some of the poetry: there are some very modern-sounding passages here, sometimes frustratingly unannotated. They jump out. I'd really like to know whether this is Lucretius being surprisingly modern, or if it's Stallings. Though she does at least explain, when using a line from Shelley's 'Ozymandias' that she adopted it - otherwise one might plausibly have wondered (with Shelley being a famous atheist) if Lucretius had inspired the same line in the 19th century poem. At one point a similar Wordsworth reference/borrowing is noted, though an ""untrodden ways"" suggesting one of the Lucy poems, is not. No doubt there were others from poets I know even less of. Meanwhile, some notes quote lines from other, later poets influenced by Lucretius, in a sort of mirror image of the notes often found in comparatively recent classic literature. And not only poets: this passage about the seasons is thought to have inspired Botticelli'sPrimavera:Spring and Venus come, and wingèd Cupid leads the way,And Mother Flora, in Zephyr’s footsteps, scatters a bouquetOf blossoms coloured bright to catch the eye, and smelling sweet,Carpeting the path that stretches out before their feet.Scorching Heat comes next, with Ceres head to toe in dust,Attended by the Northerlies that in the summer gust;Next in the annual procession, we see Autumn traipse,Swaying arm and arm with Dionysus, lord of grapes,Then other seasons follow, and the other winds blow past:Volturnus the sky-thunderer, the South-wind’s lightning blast.And then, with snow and frost in tow, the Solstice of the year,While Winter, his teeth chattering with cold, brings up the rear.The poem's main content and message - about atheism - feels astonishingly contemporary for a Roman work. If you read much content from the New Atheist movement of the 00s, all the usual arguments are here, and at least one which, IIRC, wasn't inThe God DelusionorGod Is Not Great, as I remember working it out for myself, through a fog of illness - a recursive epiphany that I was glad my mind could still muster - in spring 2008 on a miserable holiday with a soon-to-be-ex, not long after reading Dawkins' bestseller. The soul, the self, the personality,isthe nervous system (as the latter two can be changed through damage to the nervous system). Or as Lucretius puts it:For the spirit is so closely bound up with the veins and tissue,Sinews and bones, that even teeth possess a share of sense:One of the key ideas that Lucretius is missing in the poem, and seems to need, to be grasping for, is the nervous system. (The modern idea of body organ systems was centuries away yet.)However, though there is acknowledgement, in the poem that damage to the body can damage the spirit, there isn't consideration of how this fits with something mentioned by Jenkyns: ""Both Stoicism (which does believe in a divine providence) and Epicureanism assert that the mind of the wise man, enlightened by philosophy, is an impregnable citadel.""The historical Jesus almost certainly hadn't been born when Lucretius was writing, so there was no 2000 years of Christianity to draw on for examples. However, in discussing cruelties perpetrated in the name of religion - in tones very much like those of the early 21st century - there's a Greek foundational myth to return to: Agamemnon's sacrifice of Iphigenia.It's surely no coincidence that this translation was published in 2007, when interest in atheist literature had been building for several years. But codified atheism seems to have arrived alongside axial age religion itself. It was even kind of retro: ""Epicurus held that natural science is the route to philosophical understanding, and his system, from one point of view, can be seen as the revival, in a transformed shape, of an older tradition of Greek thought,"" before ""the discovery that science and philosophy are different modes of enquiry … in the later fifth century Socrates made the distinction absolute."" Very similar to a contemporary point of view in which psychology and neuroscience are expected to answer many of the questions of philosophy. (One which I tend to like, but a number of philosophy enthusiasts on GR don't.)Also in here are commonly-heard arguments against reincarnation - though with an unusual conclusion that if one can't remember a previous incarnation, there may as well be simple death; and besides, a form of reincarnation exists through the recycling of matter and particles that make up the body.Like Dawkins' atheist church idea, and various atheist meetups that endeavoured to replicate the structure of religious practice, ""Epicurus … seems to have wanted his followers to form a kind of ‘church’, encouraging them to share their lives together"" - and may, ironically, have influenced Christianity.The abrupt ending to what is surely an unfinished work - an account of the Plague of Athens - would be eerie at the best of times, and is more evocatively so in 2020. But my overriding impression of the poem's message is that the so-called Four Horsemen of New Atheism were really just footnotes to Lucretius.(Sept-Oct 2020)",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/195769.The_Way_Things_Are,The Way Things Are.txt
Life on Mars: Poems,"For 2017 I have set a goal for myself to read a minimum of twenty Pulitzer winners across all platforms. Upon hearing that Tracy K Smith had been named the United States poet laureate for the next year, I decided to read her 2012 Pulitzer winning collection Life on Mars. In poetry that is a mix of free verse, prose, letters, and songs, Smith delivers powerful words in a four part opus.Three poems stood out in this collection. The first, The Speed of Belief, pays homage to Smith's late father. Writing in alternating couplet and paragraph form, Smith's words are so deep that I felt as though I was also mourning a loved one. She writes, ""I didn't want to believe/What we believe in those rooms: That we are blessed, letting go, Letting someone, anyone;/Drag open the drapes and heave us/Back into our blinding, bright lives."" Her words grow increasingly more poignant throughout this poem as Smith balances her grief with letting go of her emotions, ending with a crescendo of the dynamic between father and daughter. I could not help but shed a tear here.Smith's title selection Life on Mars balances a plethora of emotions as she describes love, sexual violence, family dynamics, war, amongst other topics in a nine part epic. She begins with two sisters Tina and Anita as they gossip about being in love. Smith writes their section in paragraph form as she alternates between their points of view. Next she segues to describing a father's jailing of his daughter, highlighting the discrepancy between unconditional love and hatred. The poem moves to scenes in a jail and death at the hands of land mines, describing the blight of the death when people focus on hatred as opposed to love. The words here are exquisite and had me on edge, which for me as a reader does not occur too often when I read poetry; Smith's brilliancy was on full display with her centerpiece poem.Finally, They May Love All That He Has Chosen and Hate All That He Has Rejected pinpoints racial motivated killings during May, 2009. Using couplets alternating with letters, Smith first describes the hate crimes and who killed who. Then, she has the murder victims pen letters to their killers, including a heartfelt plea from a nine year old victim. All describe seeing landmarks for the first time and having unlimited capacity for love now that they are no longer confined to a body. The writing is raw, deep, and an overarching plea to stop the what seems like endless violence in this country. This poem alone merits awards and is near the end of the collection in order to leave readers feeling wowed by this special work.Tracy K Smith is deserving of her place as a poet laureate. From the small body of her work in Life on Mars, a reader only sees the tip of her exceptional work. Prior to her Pulitzer winning publication, Smith had written two other poetry collections. She has since written a memoir and has another poetry collection due out next year. If it is anything as powerful as Life on Mars, it is sure to be some of the best poetry I have written. At 5 shining stars, Tracy K Smith is one of the top authors I have read in 2017.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9639765-life-on-mars,Life on Mars Poems.txt

Loss: Poems to better weather the many waves of grief,"As I have said before when I have reviewed these types of books, I wouldn't say I am a great lover of poetry, in fact I am much nearer the opposite side of the scale. Recently book by book my view has been changing. I can honestly say I truly loved some of the different types of poetry by this author, and in particular the ones in this book. Some are not necessarily poetry as I would imagine it so much but still resonated and felt they belonged in this collection.If you are organising a funeral service some of these are ideal to be read at those. As I said earlier in my review my mum recently died and we chose a poem my daughter remembered from school called Funeral Blues by W.H. Auden. There were many in this book that I could and would have had.THE LOSS OF A MOTHER is a really good one and I took a deep breath expecting to really tear up as my own mum died quite recently but it was THE LOSS OF A FATHER that made me the most emotional, the one that had me nodding in agreement with its words and sentiment, especially with the part where your father has already planted the answers you seek etcGREAT GRIEF is another that I definitely agree with the sentiment & words of 'that great grief is born only of great love' A sentiment recently mentioned in connection to the death of Queen Elizabeth that echoed her words of 'Grief is the price you pay for love' which she said after the death of her own husband.Other poems I absolutely adored/loved wereONCE A DAYTAKE THE LOVEIF I EVER HAVE TO LEAVELAST NIGHTI found I really identified with A MOURNING MOTHER, YOU MAY BE GONE, and THAT MOMENTHaving said that I also really liked FEATHERS, ROOTS, and THERE WILL ALWAYS BE LOSSThere was only one poem I felt negativity towards and it was DEATH IS A THIEF I really strongly disliked the reference to death being like a 'cancer' personally I would substitute 'cancer' with 'monster'Summing up, whether you are a great lover or connoisseur of poetry or a complete novice learning to love poetry you will enjoy this book.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61875729-loss,Loss Poems to better weather the many waves of grief.txt
Blindenschrift,"See also:Cyrillic:Ханс Магнус ЕнценсбергерHans Magnus Enzensberger was a German author, poet, translator and editor. He had also written under the pseudonymAndreas Thalmayr.Enzensberger was regarded as one of the literary founding figures of the Federal Republic of Germany and wrote more than 70 books. He was one of the leading authors in the Group 47, and influenced the 1968 West German student movement. He was awarded the Georg Büchner Prize and the PourLe Mérite, among many others.He wrote in a sarcastic, ironic tone in many of his poems. For example, the poem ""Middle Class Blues"" consists of various typicalities of middle class life, with the phrase ""we can't complain"" repeated several times, and concludes with ""what are we waiting for?"". Many of his poems also feature themes of civil unrest over economic- and class-based issues. Though primarily a poet and essayist, he also ventured into theatre, film, opera, radio drama, reportage and translation. He wrote novels and several books for children (includingThe Number Devil, an exploration of mathematics) and was co-author of a book for German as a foreign language, (Die Suche). He often wrote his poems and letters in lower case.Enzensberger also invented and collaborated in the construction of a machine which automatically composes poems (Landsberger Poesieautomat). This was used during the 2006 Football World Cup to commentate on games.Tumult, written in 2014, is an autobiographical reflection of his 1960s as a left-wing sympathizer in the Soviet Union and Cuba.Enzensberger translated Adam Zagajewski, Lars Gustafsson, Pablo Neruda, W.

Ateş Karalamaları,"His poetry, building on Modernism, Expressionism, and Surrealism, contains powerful imagery concerned with issues of fragmentation and isolation. “He has perfected a particular kind of epiphanic lyric, often in quatrains, in which nature is the active, energizing subject, and the self (if the self is present at all) is the object,” notes critic Katie Peterson in the Boston Review.Critic and poet Tom Sleigh observed, in his Interview with a Ghost (2006), that “Tranströmer’s poems imagine the spaces that the deep then inhabits, like ground water gushing up into a newly dug well.”His honors include the Lifetime Recognition Award from the Griffin Trust for Excellence in Poetry, the Aftonbladets Literary Prize, the Bonnier Award for Poetry, the Neustadt International Prize for Literature, the Oevralids Prize, the Petrarch Prize in Germany, the Swedish Award from International Poetry Forum,the Swedish Academy’s Nordic Prize, and especially the 2011 Nobel Prize in literature.

The Essential Rumi,"""I am filled with you.Skin, blood, bone, brain, and soul.There's no room for lack of trust, or trust.Nothing in this existence but that existence.""I have deliberately taken over 6 years to read this book. I wanted to savor it like fine wine. This book is an anthology of the theologian, jurist and mystic known as ""The Roman"" despite being born in Afghanistan and writing mostly in Persian (though he did live in the former Eastern Roman Empire for much of his life). This book is controversially translated byColeman Barkswho opted for a poetic translation instead of a literal one. This often comes up when translating poetry. I remember seeing this same controversy over english translations ofThe Divine Comedy. With Dante, I elected for a poetic translation and I do so here. Even with Barks' filter, the thesis is still Rumi's. I will not waste too much time feebly trying to describe this book, but I feel obligated to say a few words. This book displays the heights of Sufism in the Middle Ages and the descriptions of sensual, erotic, neo-platonic, and divine love in this collection is staggering. Rumi is not some ancient hippie poet, but he keeps his faith and his interpretaiton of it as the key to fully understanding his poetry. I offer here, for instance, my favorite of the bunch, ""The Question"":""One Dervish to another, What was your vision of God's presence?I haven't seen anything.But for the sake of conversation, I'll tell you a story.God's presence is there in front of me, a fire on the left,a lovely stream on the right.One group walks towards the fire, into the fire, another toward the sweet flowing water.No one knows which are blessed and which not.Whoever walks into the fire appears suddenly in the stream.A head goes under on the water surface, that head pokes out of the fire.Most people guard against going into the fire,and so end up in it.Those who love the water of pleasure and make it their devotion are cheated with this reversal.The trickery goes further.The voice of the fire tells the truth saying, I am not fire.I am fountainhed. Come into me and don't mind the sparks.If you are a friend of God, fire is your water.You should wish to have a hundred thousand sets of mothwings, so you could burn them away, one set a night.The moth sees light and goes into the fire.You should see fire and go toward the light.Fire is what of God is world-consuming.Water, world-protecting.Somehow each gives the appearance of the other. To these eyes you have now, what looks like water burns.What looks like fire is a great relief to be inside.You've seen a magician make a bowl of rice seem a dish full of tiny live worms.Before an assembly with one breath he made a floor swarm with scorpions that weren't there.How much more amazing God's tricks.Generation after generation lies down defeated, they think, but they're like a woman underneath a man,circling him.One molecule-mote-second thinking of God's reversalof comfort and pain is better than attending any ritual.That splinter of intelligence is substance.The fire and water themselves:Accidental, done with mirrors.""This is a small sample of the package that you get with Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad. Though he spent his life mostly as an Islamic jurist and theologian (positions he inherited from his father), it was not until he met a traveling mystic named Shams of Tabriz that his transformation into Sufi devotee and master happened. When Shams was killed by Rumi's jealous students, his career as poet and dervish began and it has been his claim to fame for over 700 years. For Rumi Shams did not die, but became whole. Rumi would spend the rest of his life trying to become whole as well.An Egypt That Doesn't Exist:""I want to say words that flameas I say them, but I keep quietand don't try to make both worldsfit in one mouthful.I keep secret in myselfan Egypt that does not exist.Is that good or bad? I don't know.For years I gave away sexual lovewith my eyes. Now I don't.I am not in any one place.I do not have a name for what I give away.Whatever Shams gave,that you can have from me.""",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/304079.The_Essential_Rumi,The Essential Rumi.txt
Erotica Romana,"The epilogue was shocking. I didn't expect something like that from him:...Nor do the girls take offense when they see me--by no means the matrons.None finds me ugly today, though I am monstrously strong.Half a foot long, as reward, your glorious rod (dear poet)Proudly shall strut from your loins, when but your dearest commands,Nor shall your member grow weary until you've enjoyed the full dozenArtful positions the great poet Philainis describes.The prologue, the epilogue the 3rd and the 7th poem weren't published in the first edition released in 1795, because at the time they were considered obscene. Only in 1914 the full cycle of poems was published, using the version Goethe made for the 1800 edition.Some beautiful erotic scenes:From the 3rd poem:What would you give to me more? --You, Nipotina, what yours?Banquets and game tables, operas, balls, promenades down the Corso?These but deprive my sweet boy of his most opportune times.Finery, haughtiness do not entice me. Does one not lift aGown of the finest brocade just as one lifts common wool?If she's to press in comfort a lover against that soft bosom,Doesn't he want her to be free from all brooches and chains?Must not the jewelry, and then the lace and the bustles and whaleboneAll of it come off entire, if he's to learn how she feels?I encounter no troubles like those. Simple dress of rough homespun,At but a lover's mere touch, tumbles in folds to the floor.Quickly he carries the girl as she's clad in chemise of coarse linen--Just as a nursemaid might, playfully up to her bed.Drapings of satin are absent; the mattress is quite unembroidered.Large is this room where the bed offers its comfort for two.Jupiter's welcome to more from his Juno if he can get it;Let any mortal find rest, softer, wherever he can.We are content with Cupid's delights, authentic and naked--And with the exquisite creak /crack of the bed as it rocks.From the 7th poem:Do then I not become wise when I trace with my eye her sweet bosom'sForm, and the line of her hips stroke with my hand? I acquire,As I reflect and compare, my first understanding of marble,See with an eye that feels, feel with a hand that sees.While my beloved, I grant it, deprives me of moments of daylight,She in the nighttime hours gives compensation in full.And we do more than just kiss; we prosecute reasoned discussions(Should she succumb to sleep, that gives me time for my thoughts).In her embrace--it's by no means unusual--I've composed poemsAnd the hexameter's beat gently tapped out on her back,Fingertips counting in time with the sweet rhythmic breath of her slumber.Air from deep in her breast penetrates mine and there burns.Cupid, while stirring the flame in our lamp, no doubt thinks of those days whenFor the triumvirs he similar service performed.From the 23rd poem:Mine is a secret more pleasant, but even more difficult keeping:Out of abundance of heart eagerly speaketh my mouth.None of my ladyfriends dare I confide in, for they would but chide me;Nor any gentleman friend, lest he be rival to me.Rapture proclaim to the grove, to the echoing cliffs perorate it?One can do that if one's young, or if one's lonely enough.I to hexameters tell, in pentameters I will confide it:During the day she was joy, happiness all the night long.Courted by so many suitors, avoided the snares that were set herNow by one bolder than I, now by another in guile,Cleverly, daintily, always slipped past them, and sure of the byways,Comes to her lover's embrace, where he so eagerly waits.Luna! Don't rise yet. She's coming, and must not be seen by the neighbor!Breezes, rustle the leaves: muffle the sound of her feet.And as for you, little poems, o grow and flower, your blossomsCradling themselves in the air, tepid and soft with love's breath.Wafting, betray to Quirites, as Midas' reeds did with cheap gossip,One happy couple in love, and their sweet secret, at last.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10090150-erotica-romana,Erotica Romana.txt

Gökyokuş,"Can Yücel, en önemli ve popüler modern Türk şairlerinden biridir. Kullandığı kaba ama samimi diliyle okuduğu Türk şiirinde farklı bir tarz yaratmıştır. 7 yıl süre ile Millî Eğitim Bakanlığını yapan Hasan Âli Yücel’in oğludur. Ankara ve Cambridge üniversitelerinde Latince ve Yunanca okudu. Çeşitli elçiliklerde çevirmenlik, Londra’da BBC’nin Türkçe bölümünde spikerlik yaptı. Askerliğini Kore’de yaptı. 1958’de Türkiye’ye döndükten sonra bir süre Bodrum ve Marmaris'te turist rehberi olarak çalıştı. Ardından bağımsız çevirmen ve şair olarak yaşamını İstanbul’da sürdürdü. 1956 yılında Güler Yücel ile evlendi. Bu evlilikten iki kızı (Güzel ve Su) ve bir oğlu (Hasan) oldu.Son yıllarında Eski Datça’ya yerleşti ve her hafta Leman, her ay Öküz dergilerinde yazıları ve şiirleri yayımlandı. 1996 yılında kurulan Emek Partisi'nin kurucu üyeleri arasında yer aldı. ""Hava döndü"" şiiri EMEP'in parti marşı olarak kullanıldı. Cumhurbaşkanı Süleyman Demirel`e hakaretten de yargılanan Yücel, 18 Nisan 1999 seçimlerinde Özgürlük ve Dayanışma Partisi`nin İzmir 1. sıra milletvekili adayı oldu.Can Yücel, 1945-1965 yılları arasında `Yenilikler`, `Beraber`, `Seçilmiş Hikayeler`, `Dost`, `Sosyal Adalet`, `Şiir Sanatı`, `Dönem`,`Ant`, `İmece` ve `Papirüs` adlı dergilerde yazdı. Daha sonraları `Yeni Dergi`, ‘Birikim`, `Sanat Emeği`, `Yazko Edebiyat` ve `Yeni Düşün` dergilerinde yayımladığı şiir, yazı ve çeviri şiirleri ile tanınan Yücel, 1965`ten sonra siyasal konularda da ürün verdi. 12 Mart 1971 döneminde Che Guevara ve Mao'dan çeviriler yaptığı gerekçesiyle 15 yıl hapse mahkûm oldu. 1974’de çıkarılan genel afla dışarı çıktı. Dışarı çıkışının ardından hapiste yazdığı Bir Siyasinin Şiirleri adlı kitabını yayımladı. 12 Eylül 1980 sonrasında müstehcen olduğu iddiasıyla ""Rengahenk"" adlı kitabı toplatıldı.1962'de İngiltere'deyken, 1709 yılından kalma, Latin harfleriyle taş baskısı olarak basılmış bir Türkçe dilbilgisi kitabı bulması geniş yankı uyandırdı.Şiirlerinde argo ve müstehcen sözlere çok sık yer veren, bu nedenle zaman zaman dikkatleri üzerine çekip koğuşturmaya uğrayan Yücel, ilk şiirlerini 1950 yılında `Yazma` adlı kitapta toplamıştır.Can Yücel, taşlama ve toplumsal duyarlılığın ağır bastığı şiirlerinde, yalın dili ve buluşları ile dikkati çekti. Can Yücel'in ilham kaynakları ve şiirlerinin konuları; doğa, insanlar, olaylar, kavramlar, heyecanlar, duyumlar ve duygulardır. Şiirlerinin çoğunda sevdiği insanlar vardır. 'Maaile' şairin kitaplarından birine koyduğu bir ad. Can Yücel için ailesi çok önemlidir: eşi, çocukları torunları, babası.. Bu insanlarla olan sevgi dolu yaşamı şiirlerine yansımıştır. 'Küçük Kızım Su'ya', 'Güzel'e', 'Yeni Hasan'a Yolluk', 'Hayatta Ben En çok Babamı Sevdim' bu sevgi şiirlerinden bazılarıdır.Can Yücel ayrıca Lorca, Shakespeare, Brecht gibi önemli yazarların oyunlarından çeviriler yaptı. Shakespeare çevirileri (Hamlet, Fırtına ve Bir Yaz Gecesi Rüyası) aslına bağlı kalmayan, eserleri topluma aktarma amacıyla yaptığı çevirilerdir. Shakespeare'in ünlü 'to be or not to be' sözünü 'bir ihtimal daha var, o da ölmek mi dersin' şeklinde Türkçeleştirmiştir. 1959'da ilk baskısı yayımlanan 'Her Boydan' adlı kitabında dünya şairlerinin şiirlerini serbest ama çok başarılı bir biçimde Türkçeye çevirmiştir.12 Ağustos 1999 gecesi ölen şair, çok sevdiği günebakan çiçekleriyle uğurlanarak Datça'ya defnedildi.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13294181-g-kyoku,Gökyokuş.txt

İlginç bir şekilde tam anlamıyla beğendiğim tek bir şiirine rastlayamadım. Bazıları hoşuma gider gibi oldu ancak bir yerden sonra yine etkisini kaybetmiş gibi hissettirdi. Çoğu şiirinde benzer bir havaya rastladım, güzeldi ama bana bir anlam ifade etmiyordu daha doğrusu anlamını bana aktarmayı başaramıyordu. Dediğim gibi edebiyat fazlasıyla şahsi ve şiir bunun da ötesinde bir yapıya sahip. Belki yanlış bir zamanda okudum belki de ne zaman okursam okuyayım aynı düşüncelerle okuyacağım. Herkesin şiir zevki bambaşka o yüzden merak edenler yine de bakabilir. Normalde ne zaman bir şiir kitabı okusam içerisinde sevdiğim bir şiiri alıntı olarak koyarım.

The Gift,"Spiritual and Poetic ChicaneryThe most important point is that this book is NOT a book of translations of Hafez. Instead, it is a book of original poetry by Daniel Ladinsky, ""inspired by"" Hafez. Other reviewers have pointed this out, but obviously, this book's high rating and continued commercial success show that this is not well enough known. I purchased this for a poetry book discussion group, and now I feel ripped off. No one else there knew of this when I told them at the meeting (I only found out the day before, unfortunately), and were quite shocked. And these are people who have devoted their whole lives to poetry, including one who has done translation herself, so they're no rank amateurs. The person who suggested the book does not have Internet access, so I guess she didn't have a chance to do the research.Ladinsky has tried to justify pawning off his own work as that of Hafiz, including his own review here, in a pathetic attempt to use a loose definition of translation and that, if it gets to a lot of people and makes people happy, what's the problem? Well, heroin and cocaine can be loosely reinterpreted as medicine (in fact people used to think it had medicinal properties), and some could say that once they become available, they become widespread and make people happy. But that don't make shooting up and snorting good things.Ladinsky, as well Penguin (who, as far as I know, has been silent on the matter), should take responsibility for their deceitful action. And for those who try to say that Ladinsky doesn't claim to actually translate, or that Penguin went against his wishes (as he himself half-heartedly indicates): let's be clear. It says right on the cover ""Translated by Daniel Ladinsky,"" and he has done other books saying the same thing. If it happened once, it shouldn't have happened again. Also, though he hm-haws about wanting to originally call the poems ""versions,"" he doesn't disavow the end result, express regret or vow to work with a publisher who will be more honest in the future. No, he tries to justify his deceit by saying it is for our own good. Just like a cult leader.If you have any doubt about this, compare Ladinsky's work with other translations of Hafez into English. You will quickly see the difference. The translations vary quite a bit stylistically--eg, Gertrude Bell's biblical-sounding 18th-century translation, Elizabeth T. Gray's more formal translation, and Thomas Rain Crowe's more colloquial translation. But the most loose translation is still very different from this.Hafez is most known for his mastery of the ghazal, a poetic form which consists of five or more couplets, with a word or phrase from the second line of the first stanza repeated in the second line of each successive stanza. While some translators have forgone the formal structure of this form in order to attempt a more organic rhythm (such as Robert Bly and Leonard Lewisohn), the vestiges remain, creating the sense of an unfolding pattern, of insights unraveled. Not so with Ladinsky's verse, whose formal arrangement is quite abysmal, making frequent use of one or two word lines (which feels arbitrary rather than powerful), and line breaks that seem to have little rhyme or reason. The language is also usually simplistic, the use of metaphor awkward and often not interesting, so that from an aesthetic point of view, these could not be considered very good poems.If there is any value here, it would have to be from a spiritual point of view. People claim, even after knowing that Ladinsky didn't actually translate these poems, that they still find the poems uplifting. Although couched in New Age style ideas, which seem rather ""precious"" and saccharine at times, I can see this; there is something joyous in reading poem after poem that encourages love and happiness so forcefully, and some of the verses do have a rather surprising and playful sense of humor (eg, ""A Hard Decree,"" in which God posts a warning that those who can't find joy in life will feel the jaws of the world bite their sweet a--). The value of all this becomes problematic, pretty much ruined actually, by the knowledge that Ladinsky pretty much used Hafiz as a selling point. If these had been sold under his own name, or if it was marketed as ""Inspired by"" rather than ""Translations of"" that would be different.It's not as though I imagine Ladinsky is completely unfamiliar with Hafez--some of the imagery and techniques in the book imply otherwise. But it is only a vague similarity; the celebration of drunkenness, the use of erotic or earthly love as a longing for God, being self-referential--these all appear in Hafez, but not quite in the ways Ladinsky renders them. Ladinsky is a bit over-the-top in his irreverence to the point of his tone actually seeming like a parody of Hafez, rather than a respectful tribute. Others have noted that the spirituality in here bears more resemblance to Zen Buddhism than Sufism, which I think has some relevance--the use of absurdity (like in ""Two Giant Fat People""), the celebration of silence, seeing God in everything (""Courteous to the Ant""). Ladinsky mentions Allah (once, I think), and Muhammad a few times, but even those don't really say anything particularly interesting about Islam or Sufism, and as far as I know there aren't any references to the Quran--very different from the playful allusion to the Quran and Islamic and Zoroastrian (not referred to at all by Ladinsky) culture in the actual Hafez. So if you are looking to gleam something of Sufism from the ""Sufi Master,"" you won't find it here.Ladinsky talks about spending time with Meher Baba. If you look up info about Meher Baba, you will perhaps get a better idea of Ladinsky's background and influences. Meher Baba had more of a Hindu-type spirituality. I'm sorry, but the guy claimed to be an incarnation of God, and that makes me very suspicious. I only know a little of Sufism, but it seems to me even the most radical Sufi, if coming from a proper tradition, would find that to be utter blasphemy.In conclusion, Ladinsky and Penguin should be ashamed of themselves for using the name of a greatly respected poet to sell books fraudulently. If Ladinsky were to take responsibility and try to work for a more honest output in the future, maybe he could be respected by some as a spiritual writer. But as it is, he does a disservice to himself as well as Hafez. And I am sad to think that people will not look for actual translations of Hafez, relying solely on Ladinsky's inventions, which are more accessible but not the same at all. Hafez' work deserves attention, and even the worst translation is better than no access at all--or worse yet, a fraud.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/72910.The_Gift,The Gift.txt

İbrahim'in Beni Terketmesi,"Reading Bejan Matur made me reread Murat Nemet-Nejat's essay on Godless Sufism and Eda in his anthology by the same name, and I debated these ideas again and again. While Eda seems part and parcel of any poetic voice, the idea of a godless Sufism, while brilliant, seems somewhat misleading.Bejan Matur's poetry gives us a way to understand this idea much better. Whereas a Sunni thinker like the philosopher and mystic Al Ghazali is very careful to provide a transcendent space between God above and his manifestations below, Nemet-Nejat rightly points to the animistic features of both pre-Islamic Turkish society and its later heterodox forms that expressed the animistic in the transcendence and the transcendent in the animistic, thus leaving such practitioners open to accusations of heresy.But I would suggest that there is nothing godless in all this, just perhaps too much immanent godly presence for the orthodox. The basis of this tradition, found in the ilahi poetry of sheik-poets and the troubadour songs of the Anatolian ozans, has been transmuted into the gold of the modernist Turkish poetry of the 20th and 21st century. Though other forms of Western poetry, such as the Beats and L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry influence some Turkish poets, many refer back to these deeply Turkish traditions in their writing.Such is the case with Bejan Matur. As I have been translating some of her work of late, I love that How Abraham Abandoned me was bilingual; I could read the Turkish, look over at the English, try to analyze how it was translated and why. This was a great if time-consuming pleasure I will gladly do it again if the opportunity presents itself.More importantly, I saw how Matur's poems are deeply rooted in the rural setting of her family home, the Alevi tradition of her ancestors, her Kurdish background, and a sacred relationship to both the animate and inanimate aspects of the world. Though often couched in relatively indirect language when compared to the way English language poets write, the emotional depth of her work also runs deep in the more direct passages expressing a mother's love for her daughter.Needless to say, I highly recommend Matur to all. A mystical depth permeates her language. So many of the poems I read in the United States are committed to the rational and empirical. If the poet takes the opposite approach, the work is often unmoored from physical life in the attempt to achieve oneiric clarity. Matur refuses to sacrifice one for the other, walking the narrow road at a relaxed, reassuring pace, discovering many incredible things to exalt along the way.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9397167-i-brahim-in-beni-terketmesi,İbrahim'in Beni Terketmesi.txt

The Raven,"The Raven, Edgar Allan PoeThe Raven is a narrative poem by American writer Edgar Allan Poe. First published in January 1845, the poem is often noted for its musicality, stylized language, and supernatural atmosphere.It tells of a talking raven's mysterious visit to a distraught lover, tracing the man's slow fall into madness. The lover, often identified as being a student, is lamenting the loss of his love, Lenore.Sitting on a bust of Pallas, the raven seems to further instigate his distress with its constant repetition of the word ""Nevermore"".The poem makes use of a number of folk, mythological, religious, and classical references.Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.“Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—Only this and nothing more.”Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrowFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—Nameless here for evermore.And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtainThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—This it is and nothing more.”Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—Darkness there and nothing more.Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—Merely this and nothing more.Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—’Tis the wind and nothing more!”Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—Perched, and sat, and nothing more.Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;For we cannot help agreeing that no living human beingEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,With such name as “Nevermore.”But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke onlyThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”Then the bird said “Nevermore.”Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and storeCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful DisasterFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden boreOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linkingFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yoreMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressingTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease recliningOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,She shall press, ah, nevermore!Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censerSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent theeRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sittingOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floorShall be lifted—nevermore!تاریخ نخستین خوانش روز نخست ماه آوریل سال 2006میلادیعنوان: کلاغ؛

Where the Sidewalk Ends,"من به یک سری از دلایل، انگیزه های زیادی ندارم برای اینکه بچه ای از خون و ریشه های خودم داشته باشم. بچه ها رو دوست دارم، حتی تربیت کردن بچه هم مشکلی نیست، مشکل از همون پله اول سرچشمه می گیره، اینکه 50 درصد از مسئولیت اومدن یه انسان جدید به این جهان رو بر عهده بگیری و به این نتیجه برسی که قادر به این خواهی بود که این جهان رو اونقدر خوب برای بچه ـت رقم بزنی که اومدنش بهتر از نیومدنش باشهاما از وقتی با کتاب های شل سیلوراستاین آشنا شدم، به جرأت می تونم بگم که علاقه خیلی بیشتری به ایده بچه داشتن پیدا کردم. حین خوندن کتاب هاش، این ایده که که ساعت 11 شب، یه بچه 5 ساله رو ببری توی اتاق خوابش، روشنایی اتاقش رو خاموش کنی، شبخواب ـش رو روشن کنی و براش از شعرهای عمو شلبی بخونی تا خوابش ببره رهام نمی کنه. شعرهای سیلوراستاین به بزرگترین انگیزه ـم از بچه داشتن تبدیل شده و این مبالغه نیستبه این فکر می کنم که بچه ای که این شعرها رو از همون دوران خردسالی براش خونده باشن و این مضامین توی ضمیرش نقش بسته باشه، چقدر می تونه سطح فکری بالاتری از هم سن و سال هاش داشته باشه و چقدر می تونه در آینده برای ""زمین"" مفید باشه. مضامینی که سیلوراستاین بهشون پرداخته انقدر متنوع و زیادن که حتی از تمام چیزهایی که شما به عنوان والدین قراره به بچه یاد بدید هم بیشتره و کامل تره! و جالب این جاست که بعضی هاشون انقدر عمیق هستن که حتی واسه منِ 21 ساله هم آموزنده هستن. یکی از شعرهایی که حس کردم خودم هم می تونم ازش یاد بگیرم این بود:Just ME, Just MeSweet Marie, she loves just me(she also loves Maurice McGhee)No she don't, she loves just me(She also loves Louise Dupree)No she don't, she loves just me(She also loves the willow tree)No she don't, she loves just me(Poor, poor fool, why can't you seeShe can love others and still love thee)من حداقل تا یکی دو سال پیش توی درک و هضم مضمومنی که توی شعر بالا بهش پرداخته شده عاجز بودم و آدمایی رو هم می شناسم که این مشکل رو دارن، بنابراین این نشون میده که شعرهای سیلوراستاین با اینکه در وهله اول برای بچه ها نوشته شدن، ولی مخاطبشون می تونه خیلی خیلی گسترده تر از ""فقط بچه ها"" باشهواقعاً باور دارم که اگه مردم دنیا شعرهای سیلوراستاین رو مثل یه قرارداد نا نوشته از همون بچگی برای بچه هاشون بخونن، مفهوم دنیایی ازصلح و یه حسی مثه نفرت از جنگ و خون ریزی توی ذهن ها بچه ها نقش می بنده و شاید یه دنیای بهتر رو داشته باشیم. این شعر رو بخونید مثلاً:Hug O' WarI will not play at tug o' war,I'd rather play at hug o' war,Where everyone hugsInstead of tugs,Where everyone gigglesand rolls on the rug,Where everyone kisses,And everyone grins,And everyone cuddles,And everyone wins.و هر شعر هم نقاشی خاص خودش رو داره که برای بچه هایی که سواد خوندن کتاب رو ندارن، جذابیت مضاعف ایجاد می کنه و بن مایه شعر رو می تونن از نقاشی مربوط به شعر درک کننمن خودم جزء اون بچه های خوش شانسی بودم که پدر مادرم و عمه عزیزم توی بچگی برام کتاب داستان می گرفتن و می خوندن و با کتاب بزرگ شدم. با این وجود، کتاب داستان هایی که من خوندم این درجه از غنا رو نداشتن. کتاب داستان های اوایل دهه هفتاد بودن که معمولاً حول محور ""حسن کچل"" می چرخیدن و الان تنها چیزی که ازشون یادم مونده اینه:کچل کچل کلاچهروغن کله پاچهکه اینجا شاید نویسنده می خواست این پیام رو بده که نباید کچل ها رو مسخره کرد به خاطر مو نداشتنشون، ولی بر عکس این شعره توی ضمیر ناخودآگاه نقش می بست و هر وقت یه آدم کچل یا بچه ای که موهاش رو زده بودن رو می دیدم، این شعره رو می خوندم!این کتاب رو از یه حراجی پیدا کردم و دلیل اینکه خریدمش هم دو زبانه بودنش (یه طرف متن اصلی، یه طرف متن ترجمه شده) بود. پیشنهادم اینه که هر نوع شعر خارجی رو اگه به زبان اصلی نمی خونید، حتی الامکان به صورت دو زبانه بخونید و فقط به متن فارسی اکتفا نکنید. همه ـمون می دونیم که ترجمه شعر چقدر کار سختیه و چقدر از زیبایی ها و احساسات اصیل شعر در ترجمه از بین میره یا تغییر می کنه. به شخصه قسمت انگلیسی کتاب رو خوندم، ولی ترجمه ها هم خیلی خیلی عالی صورت گرفته بود و حتی یک اشکال ترجمه هم توش پیدا نکردم. نسخه من از نشر ""هوای تازه"" و با ترجمه ""رضی خدادادی"" بود.در پایان، یکی از شعرهای کوتاه و زیبای کتاب رو به عنوان حسن ختام می نویسم:LISTEN TO THE MUSTN'TSListen to the MUST'NTS, child,Listen to the DON'TSListen to the SHOULDN'TSThe IMPOSSIBLES, the WON'TSListen to the NEVER HAVESThen listen close to me_Anything can happen, child,ANYTHING can be",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30119.Where_the_Sidewalk_Ends,Where the Sidewalk Ends.txt
Leaves of Grass,"WhenLeaves of Grasswas first published, critics applauded Whitman ""only that he did not burn"" the ""mass of stupid filth"" immediately upon completion. They primarily objected to its sensual and occasionally (rather overtly) homoerotic content. Nowadays, of course, it seems entirely too mild to raise an objection on those grounds, but man, oh man, I understand the impulse to want to turn this book into kindling.It's less like THIS......and more like THIS.This weighty poetic tome has all the weaknesses inherent to self-publication: unjustified overlong length, tedious repetition of images and ideas, wildly uneven quality from one poem to the next, irritating authorial tics, and a pervasive self-important focus.""As I look at stuff,I think about stuff.O stuff! O synonym for stuff!O six-page list of things that aresimilar yet different!""It's really impossible to document the amazing repetitions inLeaves of Grassshort of simply handing you the book itself. It is repetitive in syntax, in word choice, in tone, in content, in message, in perspective. And the collection is inexcusably padded past any hope of delivering the forceful emotional impact that poems are so uniquely capable of.And man, what gives with the crappy words!? English's strongest selling point as a language is its vast, incredibly nuanced vocabulary. It's not a particularly beautiful or intuitive dictionary, but the thesaurus is stellar--we have an endless supply of synonyms at our disposal. There's really no excuse for a native English-speaking poet to resort to such dull, texture-less language. Take this brief ditty,After the Sea-Ship:After the sea-ship, after the whistling winds,After the white-gray sails taut to their spars and ropes,Below, a myriad myriad waves hastening, lifting up their necks,Tending in ceaseless flow toward the track of the ship,Waves of the ocean bubbling and gurgling, blithely prying,Waves, undulating waves, liquid, uneven, emulous waves,Toward that whirling current, laughing and buoyant, with curves,Where the great vessel sailing and tacking displaced the surface,Larger and smaller waves in the spread of the ocean yearnfully flowing,The wake of the sea-ship after she passes, flashing and frolicsome under the sun,A motley procession with many a fleck of foam and many fragments,Following the stately and rapid ship, in the wake following.Guys, did you know that winds whistle? Or that ship sails are white-gray? Or that the ocean has both ""larger and smaller waves?"" Are you kidding me? (And yes, that's the whole poem, by the way, I didn't pull him off the stage with a cane right before he got to the good part.)Am I being too unfair? Let's compare with another short, nautically-themed poem from a contemporary from the same transcendental school. Here is Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's sonnetThe Sound of the Sea.The sea awoke at midnight from its sleep,And round the pebbly beaches far and wideI heard the first wave of the rising tideRush onward with uninterrupted sweep;A voice out of the silence of the deep,A sound mysteriously multipliedAs of a cataract from the mountain's side,Or roar of winds upon a wooded steep.So comes to us at times, from the unknownAnd inaccessible solitudes of being,The rushing of the sea-tides of the soul;And inspirations, that we deem our own,Are some divine foreshadowing and foreseeingOf things beyond our reason or control.Even given the additional constraints of rhyming meter, Wadsworth (whom I'm honestly not that excited about in general) manages to deliver a concise, impactful message with an interesting scope and vocabulary. Also,The Sound of the Seawas not padded with flabby rephrasings of the same idea in an overlong collection. The point is, Whitman was mediocre, at best, even in his own time.Less THIS......more THIS.I know I'm being a bit vicious, but from six hundred pages of poetry, I gathered fewer insights than from a collection of half-a-dozen from a better poet. I have already started reading a new poetry collection, and I'm compelled to read and reread, discovering new depths, awestruck at the emotional viscera. ReadingLeaves of Grasswas, in comparison, watching a slightly interesting shade of paint dry.The wide-eyed transcendental awe that Whitman is famous for grates under the relentless single-minded repetition. Whitman's spirit may have been remarkable, but his language is uninspired, hobbled by a limited vocabulary and overburdened by his didactic approach to inspiration. He tries too hard to educate and persuade, and sounds like a salesmen hustling flora and fauna door-to-door. The man's never met a thing he wasn't ready to romanticize: toiling farmers, shackled slaves, dying soldiers--they are noble savages, one and all.Less THIS......more THIS.His relentless optimism at the splendor of America (politically, geographically, socially--every part of it is super-duper splendid, according to Walt) displays a total unwillingness to look critically at the world he lives in, which is a tremendous failure for a poet. Page after page documents the unending beauty of the territories he'd never visited, but there are only a handful of passing acknowledgements that Americans were actively slaughtering one another over the right to own other living humans. Whitman is not being naive here, but rather deliberately myopic.An extremely tedious ""classic"" that is really nothing more than rambling sermons from an inept poet. I can see someone being charmed by his incessant enthusiasm for life, but for a pragmatist like myself, I can't stomach the lack of emotional maturity. The world has all kinds of grace and majesty and stars and perfection, but it also has human beings killing other human beings for no clear reason. A robust poet can make sense of this dilemma--Whitman is no robust poet, so he merely turns away from it.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27494.Leaves_of_Grass,Leaves of Grass.txt
Sir Gawain and the Green Knight: A New Verse Translation,"It’s always puzzling to know what to do with a book subtitled “A New Verse Translation.” It’s all very well for the moment, of course, but what about in a few years? When the translation is no longer new, will it need a new title? I have similar reservations about terms like “postmodern.” What comes after it? Post-postmodern? And is modernism now called pre-postmodernism?All of which doesn’t seem strictly relevant, except that I can’t help feeling that there’s something slightly self-conscious about Simon Armitage’s new verse translation of the Middle English masterpiece Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, which is somehow symbolized by the subtitle.The other thing about the subtitle is that it is exactly the same as Seamus Heaney’s new verse translation of Beowulf, which, since it was published in 1999, isn’t really new any more. On the front cover of Armitage’s translation is a glowing review from Heaney, and in the Acknowledgements section, Armitage acknowledges Heaney himself and his translation as one of his inspirations. Inside the jacket-flap, another reviewer, this one anonymous (like both the Beowulf- and Gawain-poets, ironically) but writing for the Sunday Telegraph, enthuses about how both Armitage and, earlier, Heaney, have helped “to liberate Gawain [or, presumably, Beowulf:] from academia.” Like Heaney’s Beowulf, Armitage’s Gawain has a facing-page original text and translation; like Heaney’s Beowulf, Armitage’s Gawain has a black cover with a stylish armoured figure on it; like Heaney’s Beowulf, Armitage’s Gawain has ragged pages along the vertical edge, making is I suppose equally difficult to turn the page.Heaney’s Beowulf was well known, among other things, for bringing the ancient poem right up-to-date—the new date, that is, not the eighth-century date at which the poem was composed. Thus, Heaney translated the poem’s famous opening word, “Hwæt!” as “So.” Further down the page, the Old English “þæt wæs god cyning!” became “That was one good king.” Such translations as these made many academics wonder about the advisability of providing “new verse translations” of medieval poems. But since, as the Sunday Telegraph’s reviewer enthusiastically proclaimed, the aim of both translations was to liberate the poems from academics, what they thought really didn’t matter. It didn’t matter that Faber and Faber in Britain, and W. W. Norton in America were turning not to translators with a knowledge of the Middle Ages for these translations, but to poets who had to learn the language as they went.I’ll give you some examples from Armitage’s Gawain. Early in the poem, when the feast in Camelot, the Gawain-poet writes that the canopy over the royal dais “were enbrawded and beten wyth the best gemmes / That myght be preved of prys wyth penyes to bye / in daye” (78-80). This can be literally translated as “were embroidered and beaded with the best gems that could be proved of value to buy in that day.” The translation is rough and unpleasant, but it’s literal. Armitage translates that the tapestry was “studded with stones and stunning gems. / Pearls beyond pocket. Pearls beyond purchase.” Here’s it’s not specifically the translation that’s at issue. Armitage has translated into a style that is hip for the moment—the use of parallelism and fragment—but which, for one, gives undue emphasis to a rather unimportant feature of the description and, for another, uses a poetic trick that pulls the reader out of the world of the poem and into the modern world. That was one good canopy.Here’s another example. When Gawain arms to face the Green Knight at the end of the poem, the poet describes his armour as “The gayest into Grece” (2023). Acknowledging that “into” might better be translated as “unto,” we can see that the line is supposed to imply that Gawain’s armour is the most splendid in Europe—in the known world, in fact. in the medieval imagination, Greece was the edge of the civilized world. It included Byzantium, the seat of the eastern Roman Empire, known for its stylized art, gold and blue, richness and wealth. The description places Gawain’s armour in that oriental world, giving audiences a mental image of splendour, brightness, colour, vividness. Armitage writes that “no man shone more, it seemed / from here to ancient Greece.” Armitage specifically limits the reader to thinking not of Byzantine art, but of the Greece of mythology. The original line held both implications. The translation directs us exclusively to one.In all fairness, Armitage defends this practice in his introduction and, as we might expect, his argument is airtight. So would an argument be from the opposite perspective. That’s the nature of argument. But I can’t help wondering if there’s something wrong with entrusting the translation of a masterpiece of medieval literature to someone whose expertise is modern poetry—Ted Hughes and the like. It’s like entrusting brain surgery to a heart specialist. Sure, he knows enough anatomy to get away with it. But I’m not sure that “getting away with it” is really enough. I’d like to be imaginatively transported to the world of medieval romance, not of new verse translations.It’s also only fair to add that this is a highly readable translation. You speed through these pages, and time flies away from you. You’ve just met Arthur at Camelot, and before you know it, you’re reading the concluding lines. Some lines are particularly beautiful, particularly the famous passage of the seasons, and one passage actually made me think about the poem in a different way. (It was the section detailing Camelot’s craven assertion that it would be “Cleverer to have acted with caution and care” [line 677:]; that puts their eventual glib and joyous acceptance of Gawain’s error into a wholly different perspective, for me.)Ultimately, I think, we have to see a book like this not so much as a translation of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, but as Simon Armitage’s poem inspired by it. As such, it’s a beautiful achievement—certainly as beautiful as Heaney’s Beowulf—and will hopefully lure many readers to its source, the Middle English poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5206073-sir-gawain-and-the-green-knight,Sir Gawain and the Green Knight A New Verse Translation.txt
Inferno,"Before I start talking about the book proper, I have a confession to make: I wasn't sure I really wanted to read philosophical poetry written seven centuries ago. I had doubts about style, quality of translation and my own lack of literary background in decyphering the numerous Christian and mythological references, not to mention political and cultural trivia from Dante's Florence. Thanks to my Goodreads friends, I took the plunge and I can report back that it was well worth the effort. Even better, it wasn't an effort, but a joyride, thanks primarily to my lucky pick of the Ciardi translation for my first foray into the phantastical world of Dante. So my answer to the questions: can we still read Dante for pleasure and not for academic study is a resounding yes. Another big Yes is the answer to the relevance of the Commedia for the modern reader. The fundamental soul searching questions about the relationship between spiritual and material life, morality and political power, religious and secular governance, reason and faith remain unchanged over centuries and must still be answered by each of us after our own fashion. Dante is as great a choice as the lightbearer showing the way to redemption, as Virgil was to the poet on his descent into Hell.Nell mezzo del camin di nostra vitami ritrovai per una selva oscurache la diritta via era smarrita.""Right from the start it is evident that the poet's major talent is to say so much with such economy of words and with such elegance. Page after page of commentary has been written about these famous opening lines. The key to deciphering the poem is here: an allegorical journey of self discovery and liberation from doubts, uncertainty and fear. Dante is the hero of his own epic poem, and he starts with a confession of how he almost lost his faith in his search for the ultimate truth through the books of ancient philosophers and the myths and legends that have been passed on from antiquity. But Human Reason on its own is not enough, and salvation for Dante can come only by way of Divine intercession. Somebody up there loves him (Beatrice, the love of his life, symbol of purity and innocence, taken away to Heaven in her early youth). She sends a guide to help Dante on his perilous journey: the Roman poet Virgil, the mentor and personal hero of our narrator. Together they must pass through the underground halls of the damned, there to witness the justice administered by a stern God upon sinners of every variety. Only after renouncing and condemning sin, can the upward journey begin.Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrateAnother famous quote that has entered into the world's cultural heritage marks the gate to the depths of eternal torment and despair. I have no intention of enumerating every level of the arhitecture of Hell and every lost soul that Dante and Virgil encounters. What impressed me most though was the rigid organization and the careful planning of each punishment, designed to reflect the gravity of the crime and to correctly assign the torment most appropriate for each category of sinner. For example, thieves must steal from one another the very shapes in which they appear. Nothing is left to chance, and accurate maps can and have been drawn of the allegorical geography of Hell, its nine concentric and descending level, its dark rivers and fiery pits. Instead of chaos and anarchy I discovered an inflexible and merciless order, with Minos as the judge who weights each soul's guilt and then sends them to their correct circle and niche, like with like, crime and punishment linked together for eternity.There is no place for pity here. Who is more arrogantwithin his soul, who is more impiousthan one who dares to sorrow at God's judgment.The escalation of dread and horror is well served by the poet's imagination, who starts the journey with sights and dialogues still anchored and related to the world above, but grows more grim and grotesque as the deeper levels are reached. Monsters and tortures grow more elaborate, more frightening, more inventive with each circle, until the senses are overwhelmed and humbled. The main lesson in Hell is to be aware of the wages of sin:O endless wrath of God: how utterlythou shouldst become a terror to all menwho read the frightful truths revealed to me!And an example of a gargoyle riding a centaur, an image worthy of the brush of Brueghel:Upon his shoulders, just behind his heada snorting dragon whose hot breath set fireto all it touched, lay with its wings outspred.Coming back to the sinners Dante meets in his downward journey, it should be noticed that he is not above paying back some personal political woes, by placing his contemporaries and adversaries inside particularly gruesome torture chambers. These human foibles, coupled with the apparent vanity and pride of the poet conscious of his worth as an equal of the ancient masters, are a source of humour and gentle irony at his own fallible nature, a more enchanting and entertaining portrait than his pious and hollier than thou alter ego. As a literary device, Dante uses prophecy to warn about the risks of the future of his beloved Florence, from which he was exiled by conspiracies within his own party, aided and abetted by the papal legate:Two are honest, but none will head them. There,pride, avarice, and envy are the tonguesmen know and heed, a Babel of despair.I should also mention the major political aspect of the poem, on one hand denouncing the corrupt and venal warring families of Tuscany, and on the other launching impassioned attacks on the degradation of the church in its power games and search for material governance. These ideas will be later developed into a pamphlet (De Monarchia) that was quickly put on the list of forbidden books by the papacy. Dante argues in favor of a secular government coupled with a church that renounces wealth and power and takes care only of the spiritual needs of its flock. He is well ahead of his time in this humanist plea for separation of powers and in his references to the ancient philosophers.Another major appeal of the journey for me was the recognition of many of the mythological characters residing in Hell. The most often referenced sources are Ovid with his metamorphoses and Virgil with his Aeneid, but the erudition and the variety of Dante's interests (history, cosmology, art, etc) are reason enough to name him among the greatest personalities of a nascent Renaissance movement.Much has also been said and praised about his liberation of the Italian language from the restrictions and limitations of Church latin, putting his vision into the live and colourful 'vulgata' dialect of the people. John Ciardi has this to say about the style of the poem, and he should know best, as a poet himself and a native speaker of Italian :I do not imply that Dante's is the language of common speech. It is a much better thing than that: it is what common speech would be if it were made perfect.Like Cervantes and Shakespeare centuries later, Dante stands as a national idol that defines a culture and makes it universal. I did try to read some of his verses in the original Italian and I was struck by the musicality and the rhythm that is so difficult to translate in another language. Ciardi did an excellent job in keeping the faith with this singsong quality of the poem, even if he is said to have taken liberties with the actual content. Not being a scholar or a purist, I was well satisfied with the result, especially as he kept the introductions and the end of canto notes to a minimum, allowing me to get immersed in the story instead of chasing endless commentaries and interpretations.The Ciardi translation is also the reason I am reviewing separately the three books that comprise the Commedia (The Divine was apparently an appelation added by later commentators) , as I have them published individually. I should warn though that The Inferno is not a standalone book. In the big concept of Dante's allegory, it is only the first step towards salvation, and the next two books are just as important in the final judgement. I had several more notes and quotes saved, but I'll stop for now, hoping I've managed to convince some of my friends to put Dante on their reading lists. In the words of Arnie:""I'll be back!""

The Divine Comedy: Inferno - Purgatorio - Paradiso,"""Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch’intrate.""""Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.""Dante Alighieri’s The Divine Comedy isn’t just a poem—it’s an eternal nightmare carved into literature. a journey through Hell’s horrors, Purgatory’s trials, and Heaven’s eternal glow. Sinners burn, the repentant climb, and the blessed shine—all under the weight of divine justice. Virgil guides, Beatrice saves, and Dante walks the path of every soul—lost, seeking, and finally found.This first part of The Divine Comedy is a journey through the nine circles of Hell, a twisted, poetic, and deeply personal exploration of sin, punishment, and divine justice. The first part of The Divine Comedy takes Dante (yes, the poet wrote himself as the main character—bold move) on a terrifying journey through the nine circles of Hell, with his personal guide, Virgil, leading the way.With the legendary Virgil as his guide, Dante descends deeper and deeper into a realm of fire, ice, and eternal despair, where sinners are tormented in grotesque yet eerily poetic ways. And yes—Dante literally put his real-life enemies in Hell, proving that petty is eternal.Dante’s The Divine Comedy is a journey of the soul—through fire, repentance, and divine glory. A tale of justice, faith, and love, this epic masterpiece is not just a story—it is a reckoning, a reflection, and a path from darkness to eternal light~The Journey Begins📌-Inferno – The Descent into Darkness”THROUGH ME THE WAY INTO THE SUFFERING CITY,THROUGH ME THE WAY TO THE ETERNAL PAIN,THROUGH ME THE WAY THAT RUNS AMONG THE LOST.JUSTICE URGED ON MY HIGH ARTIFICER;MY MAKER WAS DIVINE AUTHORITY,THE HIGHEST WISDOM, AND THE PRIMAL LOVE.BEFORE ME NOTHING BUT ETERNAL THINGSWERE MADE, AND I ENDURE ETERNALLY.ABANDON EVERY HOPE, WHO ENTER HERE.”*Lost in a dark forest (a metaphor for his spiritual crisis), Dante is confronted by three beasts:-A lion (Pride)-A leopard (Lust)-A she-wolf (Greed)Just as he’s about to lose all hope, Virgil appears and offers to lead him through Hell. From here, Dante begins his descent, and what follows is one of the most haunting literary journeys ever written.~Themes of Inferno-The Nature of Sin – People create their own suffering.-Divine Justice – Sinners receive exactly what they deserve.-Moral Transformation – Dante starts with sympathy but gradually accepts God’s justice.~The Nine Circles of Hell – Sin Meets Perfect Punishment-🔖-The Echoes of Limbo (Circle 1)""Noi non avem speranza, ma viviamo in disio.""""We have no hope, yet we live in longing.""Here, Dante walks among Socrates, Aristotle, Homer—brilliant minds barred from salvation simply because they were born before Christ. There is no fire, no screaming—just a silent grief that stretches forever.🔖-The Storm of the Lovers (Circle 2 – Lust)""Amor, ch’al cor gentil ratto s’apprende,prese costui de la bella personache mi fu tolta; e ‘l modo ancor m’offende.""""Love, which quickly kindles in noble hearts,seized this one for the beauty of my body,which was taken from me in a manner still painful to me.""Dante meets Francesca and Paolo, two lovers murdered for their affair, their souls now tossed forever in a violent storm, mirroring the uncontrollable winds of their passion.Yet, it is not their crime but their love that makes Dante weep:""Nessun maggior dolore / che ricordarsi del tempo felice nella miseria.""""There is no greater sorrow than to recall happiness in times of misery.""And in that moment, he faints, overwhelmed by their tragedy.🔖 Gluttony – Devoured by Eternal Hunger (Circle 3)""La pioggia etterna maladetta, fredda, greve,regola lor qualità nuova.""""The eternal cursed rain, cold and heavy,changes them into something new.""The gluttonous lie drowned in endless filth, as the three-headed Cerberus tears into them. They devoured life, now life devours them.🔖 Greed – The Weight of Gold (Circle 4)""Perché tieni? e perché burli?""""Why do you hoard? Why do you squander?""Hoarders and spendthrifts roll enormous stones at each other in eternal struggle, a useless war of excess and waste. Their greed has made them unrecognizable, reduced to faceless shadows beneath their burdens.🔖 The Wrathful Drown in Their Own Rage (Circle 5 – River Styx)Here, the wrathful tear at each other’s flesh, while the slothful—who in life never took action—are submerged beneath the black water, trapped in eternal silence.Dante sees their fate and whispers:""Questi si percotean non pur con mano,ma con la testa e col petto e coi piedi.""""They struck not only with hands,but also with their heads and chests and feet.""A brutal, never-ending war with no winner, no resolution—just rage, feeding rage, feeding rage.🔖 Heretics Burn in Flaming Tombs (Circle 6 – The City of Dis)""Qui son li eresiarche / con lor seguaci, d’ogne setta, e molto più che non credi.""""Here lie the heresiarchs and their followers,of every sect, far more than you would believe.""Dante walks through a city of the damned, its walls glowing red with the flames of eternal suffering. Here, those who denied the soul’s immortality are buried in fire—because they believed the soul died with the body, their punishment makes that belief an unrelenting truth.🔖 The Forest of the Suicides (Circle 7 – Violence Against the Self)""Noi fummo già uomini, e or siam fatti sterpi.""""We were once men, now we are mere sticks.""Dante snaps a branch, and a voice wails in agony—for the suicides are now twisted trees, their bodies denied even the shape of humanity.One of them whispers in sorrow:""Io son colui che tenni ambo le chiavi del cor di Federico.""""I am the one who held both keys to Frederick’s heart.""Their only voice is pain, their only future silence, unless Dante carries their story forward.🔖 The Web of Deception (Circle 8 – Fraud)Here, hypocrisy, flattery, sorcery, and corruption take monstrous forms:False prophets walk backwards forever—because they sought to see the future, now they can never look forward again.Thieves are bitten by snakes, only to transform into them, losing their identities to deception.Hypocrites wear golden robes lined with lead, shining on the outside, crushing within.Dante watches and mutters:""E perché tu più volontier mi gratti,sappi ch’i’ son Bertran de Born.""""And because you find pleasure in my torment,know that I am Bertran de Born.""🔖 Betrayal – The Frozen Dead (Circle 9 – Treachery)""Vexilla regis prodeunt inferni.""""The banners of the King of Hell advance.""Finally, Dante reaches the ultimate sin: treachery. Here, Judas, Brutus, and Cassius are devoured in the mouths of Satan himself, who is trapped waist-deep in ice, his wings flapping but never flying, his tears frozen as he weeps for eternity.And as Dante climbs past Lucifer’s twisted body, he emerges on the other side of the world—for Hell is only half the journey.📌~Purgatorio – The Path to RedemptionPurgatory is not eternal punishment, but a place where souls are purified before entering Heaven. Unlike Hell, where there is no hope, Purgatory is a place of spiritual progress.~Structure of Purgatory:Purgatory is a mountain divided into seven terraces, each representing a Deadly Sin:Pride – Souls carry heavy stones to learn humility.Envy – The envious have their eyes sewn shut to stop them from comparing themselves to others.Wrath – The wrathful must walk through thick smoke, symbolizing their past blindness caused by anger.Sloth – The lazy must run constantly to make up for lost time.Greed – The greedy lie face-down, reflecting their obsession with wealth.Gluttony – The gluttonous are starved in front of unreachable food.Lust – The lustful are purified by fire, cleansing their desires.💭Key Moments in Purgatorio:-Virgil’s Departure & Beatrice’s Arrival-Virgil (representing human reason) cannot enter Heaven, showing that faith is needed beyond logic.-Beatrice (symbol of divine love) takes over as Dante’s guide.- The Earthly Paradise (Eden) at the SummitThe final step before entering Heaven, symbolizing mankind’s original purity before sin.~Themes of Purgatorio:-Hope & Redemption – Unlike in Hell, these souls can reach Heaven.-The Role of Free Will – Sinners must actively work to cleanse themselves.-The Power of Divine Love – Beatrice’s presence highlights that love leads to salvation.📌Paradiso – The Vision of Divine LoveParadise is the most abstract and mystical section of the poem. Dante ascends through nine celestial spheres, encountering saints, angels, and divine wisdom, before reaching the Empyrean, the dwelling place of God.~The Nine Spheres of HeavenEach sphere reflects a virtue or aspect of divine order:The Moon – Souls who broke vows but were still virtuous.Mercury – The ambitious, who did good but sought personal glory.Venus – The lovers, purified by divine love.The Sun – Home of great theologians and scholars.Mars – Warriors of the faith, like Charlemagne and Cacciaguida.Jupiter – Rulers who upheld justice.Saturn – The contemplatives and monks.The Fixed Stars – The saints and the apostles.The Primum Mobile – The angels, closest to God.The Final Vision: The Beatific VisionAt the end of his journey, Dante experiences a transcendent vision of God as a radiant light that embodies divine love. Words fail him:""All'alta fantasia qui mancò possa;ma già volgeva il mio disio e il velle,sì come rota ch'igualmente è mossa.""(Here my high imagination failed;but already my desire and will were movinglike a wheel that is equally turned.)""Nella sua volontade è nostra pace."" (Canto III)""In His will is our peace.""~Themes of Paradiso-Divine Grace – No soul can reach Heaven by logic alone; grace is required.-The Ultimate Knowledge – Dante’s journey reflects humanity’s longing for truth and enlightenment.-Love as the Universe’s Driving Force – The final realization: ""The love that moves the sun and the other stars.""~Why It Stands Out-The Psychological Depth – Dante doesn’t just observe Hell; he reacts. He pities some souls, rages at others, and even faints from horror.-The Blend of Myth and Reality – Historical figures, mythological creatures, and personal enemies all find a place in Dante’s underworld.-The Language – The haunting beauty of Italian poetry makes the suffering feel almost sacred:-Dante and Virgil’s companionship is one of the best parts of The Divine Comedy. Their dynamic is like the ultimate mentor-student duo, with Virgil being the wise guide and Dante, the curious (sometimes terrified) traveler. Virgil is basically Dante’s emotional support poet, leading him through Hell’s horrors and Purgatory’s trials, always keeping him in check. And then comes Beatrice, bringing in a whole new level of divine guidance.~Chilling Verses:🔹 The Gates of Hell Inscription:""Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch’intrate.""""Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.""🔹 Francesca and Paolo’s Tragic Love (Circle 2, Lust):""Amor, ch'a nullo amato amar perdona.""""Love, which pardons no one loved from loving in return.""🔹 The Forest of Suicides (Circle 7):""Noi fummo già uomini, e or siam fatti sterpi.""""We were once men, now we are mere sticks.""🔹 Satan’s Final Image:""O quanto parve a me gran maraviglia / quand’io vidi tre facce alla sua testa!""""Oh, how great my horror when I saw three faces upon his head!""📖 Themes That Hit Hard -Karma at Its Most Brutal – Each sinner’s punishment fits their crime with terrifying poetic justice.- Fear & Despair – The idea of eternal suffering is more disturbing than any horror novel.- Dante’s Personal Vendettas – The pettiness is real. He literally wrote his political enemies into Hell.📜Final Thoughts — A Masterpiece of Darkness-Inferno warns us about sin and its consequences.-Purgatorio teaches the value of redemption and self-growth.-Paradiso offers the ultimate reward—divine love and enlightenment.Dante’s Inferno is breathtakingly dark, poetic, and disturbing. Each punishment is carved with merciless precision, and the imagery is so vivid that it still haunts literature 700 years later.Dante’s Hell warns, his Purgatory redeems, and his Paradise uplifts. He begins the journey lost, weighed down by sin, but ends in divine clarity, gazing upon the love that moves the universe itself. Is it an easy read? Nope. But if you love dark, immersive poetry with deep symbolism, it’s a must-read.⭐ Rating: 4/5 — A beautifully crafted, unsettling masterpiece.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6656.The_Divine_Comedy,The Divine Comedy Inferno - Purgatorio - Paradiso.txt
James Joyce: The Poems in Verse and Prose,"A profound influence of literary innovations of Irish writerJames Augustine Aloysius Joyceon modern fiction includes his works,Ulysses(1922) andFinnegans Wake(1939).Sylvia Beachpublished the first edition ofUlyssesof James Augustine Aloysius Joyce in 1922.John Stanislaus Joyce, an impoverished gentleman and father of James Joyce, nine younger surviving siblings, and two other siblings who died of typhoid, failed in a distillery business and tried all kinds of other professions, including politics and tax collecting. The Roman Catholic Church dominated life of Mary Jane Murray, an accomplished pianist and his mother. In spite of poverty, the family struggled to maintain a solid middle-class façade.Jesuits at Clongowes Wood college, Clane, and then Belvedere college in Dublin educated Joyce from the age of six years; he graduated in 1897. In 1898, he entered the University College, Dublin. Joyce published first an essay onWhen We Dead Awaken, play ofHeinrich Ibsen, in theFortnightly Reviewin 1900. At this time, he also began writing lyric poems.After graduation in 1902, the twenty-year-old Joyce went to Paris, where he worked as a journalist, as a teacher, and in other occupations under difficult financial conditions. He spent a year in France, and when a telegram about his dying mother arrived, he returned. Not long after her death, Joyce traveled again. He left Dublin in 1904 with Nora Barnacle, a chambermaid, whom he married in 1931.Joyce publishedDublinersin 1914,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Manin 1916, a playExilesin 1918 andUlyssesin 1922. In 1907, Joyce published a collection of poems,Chamber Music.At the outset of the Great War, Joyce moved with his family to Zürich.

Winter Roses after Fall,"Winter Roses after Fallwas a topical read for me. The poems by both Drake and Sin are brief and episodic. Still, I wanted more from this collection.A huge roadblock for me was how specific some(most?)of the poems were written to be. I felt as though Drake and Sin opted out of capturing the feelings and emotionality of heartbreak in order to allow for an explicit explanation oftheirspecific experiences. At times, this felt like looking behind the curtain—the magic of poetry was dulled by a constant inclination towards confessionalism.I did find a few poems that I enjoyed, though not necessarily because of their writing. Rather, there are little blurbs of helpful advice and offerings of perspective. This could be read as a late-night text exchange between friends who are both still ""getting it all out"" after a breakup—some of it is relatable, but it falls short of sophistication.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56898956-winter-roses-after-fall,Winter Roses after Fall.txt
When You Ask Me Where I'm Going,"Originally published on The Nerd Daily| Review by Beth MowbrayWhen You Ask Me Where I’m Going is a thought-provoking debut novel which weaves together poetry, prose, and illustrations in a rare and extraordinary fashion. The foundation of this book is the narrative of a young immigrant mother escaping a history of trauma to live undocumented and raise her daughter in North America. This core body of prose is surrounded by poems and artwork that explores and embraces a broad range of issues related to culture, immigration, feminism, stigma, and much more.Perhaps a daunting concept to other debut writers, Kaur censors herself little in this book. With a dynamic, resounding voice she explores themes that are profound yet easy to consider and engage with throughout the text. Dividing the book into six sections, Kaur groups the lessons and insight she imparts into topics named primarily for parts of the human body: “skin,” “nerve,” and “heart,” for example. Within these sections she then tackles a multitude of themes that resonate within our contemporary personal and political worlds—race, ethnicity, and discrimination; trauma, abuse, and mental health in the context of interpersonal relationships; the daunting journey of motherhood, made a heavier task by the compounding external factors of today’s society.Perhaps the greatest theme, however, the theme underlying all others, is that of identity. How we define ourselves, our inherent value and worth, as well as how it is defined for us by others based upon their own (often skewed) lens of people and the world around them. Kaur explores the idea of being assessed by one’s appearance rather than what is underneath or held inside. She conveys the pain of being categorized as “other” based on one’s race, ethnicity, or culture and fighting the pressure to fit a certain “mold” formed by the assumptions of others. She explores the process of learning to be comfortable as oneself rather than being trapped by the meaning all too often assigned by others when you are part of a certain group. And she then underlines these ideas by providing a historical context, both personal and global.Tagged for ages 14+, this deeply moving work is sure to draw both young and older adults. Raw and introspective, both painful and uplifting to read, When You Ask Me Where I’m Going seamlessly conveys a vast spectrum of emotions in a very real way that the reader can easily connect with. Much of the subject matter is quite difficult to process, however Kaur does not flinch, does not hide from it. She writes with anger and outrage, with confidence and empathy, with sadness and hope. Her authorial voice is crisp and clear, bold and determined. Kaur expresses a genuine desire to embrace life and to see the world – in fact, to see each human being – do better.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43453732-when-you-ask-me-where-i-m-going,When You Ask Me Where I'm Going.txt
The Mermaid's Voice Returns in This One,"I read most of this book while listening to Tiny Moving Parts and Taylor Swift's new album in a hipstery coffeeshop in DC and it was such a beautiful time.I'm quite sad to have finished this series. I wanted to read it for so long and now that it's over, I'm left with such a sense of longing. I want to be friends with the poet, to drink wine together as we realize that we don't need anyone else but ourselves in order to feel whole.I had two encounters this week. In the first one, I met a guy and I really wanted something from him. In the second one, I met a girl and she really wanted something from me. Both of them were strangers from the internet, both of them were great people, people that I trusted blindly and don't regret it (and my god, someone should have already murdered me, with all of the bad choices I've made lately). And I was so vulnerable in front of that guy and that person was so vulnerable in front of me.I could go on a rant about how fantastic the internet is but really, so much of this book made me think of those two encounters, how incredibly different they were but really, how they were exactly the same, how much of being a person depends on the ability to speak up, to say what you want, to make it clear to the others around, how kindness is such a powerful thing, how femininity is a raw and gorgeous entity, how much I've grown as a person to be able to go through these two encounters and truly take the most out of them, how fantastic it is to be able to connect with pure strangers and really see them. How magical it is to be seen.There's much to say about this style and the future of poetry but really, all I want to do now is find a place to throw my suitcase in and go on a run through National Mall. Briefly, I like this. It's repetitive and if you read one of her books, you know what it's going to be about but this truly resonates with me.I wonder what it'll be like to reread this book in 4 years, I somehow feel I'll still love it but also that I'll be more critical.Welp, I essentially just got kicked out of this cafe and will probably never come back to finish this review but yeah, this is a nice quick read.What I'm Taking With Me- Say hello to fairies around you, enjoy the sound of mermaids singing.- Enjoy moments of vulnerability- Fight villains.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36297088-the-mermaid-s-voice-returns-in-this-one,The Mermaid's Voice Returns in This One.txt
Not My White Savior: A Memoir in Poems,"I used to think of inter-country adoption in simple terms - “unwanted children” blessed with “better lives” in the West. Then I went to China and learned about some of the coercion if not outright confiscation involved in procuring infants during the country’s adoption boom.Sadly, similar ugliness seems to have happened in Korea. Julayne Lee’s Not My White Savior, a memoir in poems, is about her own adoption into a white Christian family in Minnesota, and how she returned to Korea as an adult and continuously grapples with feelings of loss and alienation. And anger, so much anger. She touches on how the South Korean government failed its children, the lack of support for unwed mothers, the 200,000 infants sent abroad in an industry that lined so many pockets.On a personal level, Lee clearly didn’t have a happy childhood. I have met transracial adoptive parents who are open, communicative and aware their children will have different life experiences - and other parents who are dismissive of their children’s struggles and push the “we saved you” narrative. Lee seems to have been raised by the latter, thus her more pessimistic views of inter-country adoption.Still, whether an adoptee has supportive parents or not, we should be able to acknowledge there is gain AND loss when children are sent far from homelands, and that more than a few birth families were split against their wishes. Some of the best books and articles I’ve read uncovering troubling adoption practices are by white adoptive parents who wanted deeper understanding of how their children came to them. Basically, we need to stop with the “better life” narrative. It reeks of superiority, and people’s lives are far more nuanced.Though I do struggle with poetry, I was riveted by Lee’s story. She is blunt and passionate, and I appreciate having another narrative of the transracial and inter-country adoptee experience.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33947326-not-my-white-savior,Not My White Savior A Memoir in Poems.txt
Love Her Wild,"You and Iwill belost and founda thousand timesalong thiscobbledroad of us.When you don’t have the prowess of stringing your thoughts with rhythmic phrases, and you still dream to be called a poet, often you do what’s plausibly the most obvious alternative:Just write the sentences, and press theEnterkey in random places.You have written a prose-poem, congratulations!Just know this, pal, it’s not that easy. Don’t insult Rimbaud, he suffered enough to die young.Love isthrowing yourself into a stormy seahoping there are arms to catch youknowing that without the leapthere is only the safeand lonely shore.Ah, all that is definitely well put. But, even without sounding like a snob, I came across dozens of these stuffs whenever I misuse my spare time in social media. There are probably two things that make this one not so tedious: decent photographs that are quite in relevance, and content that isn’t at all obsequious. Exuberant yet imitative, to sum it briefly. I however came across something that did feel from the heart, in a friend’s quaint words:“And, it was wonderful for me, a woman, to be reminded that the world is also full of beautiful men who love and cherish women for the playful, complicated and stunning creatures they are. Men who would never harm a woman or take anything from her by force. Men who help women put on their coats, brush the errant hairs from their eyes, and are attentive to their protection and well-being, even in their sleep.”It certainly feels great that the quotes that so failed to impress me, managed to captivate someone as such. I have linkedJulie’s excellent review, though it may seem to be on the opposite end of the spectrum, despite being much more alluring.This book may have proved to be suitable for me, had I been someone who’s looking for some non-engaging stuff to finish his or her Goodreads goal? (I still don’t get these things…it’s not like you are going to die or something if you don’t.) I practically found it more underwhelming, for I read Anna Shtorm’sFriends Over Loversjust a few months ago, and it’s much, much better, while still being underrated. This one would have been more congenial for me if I read it on Instagram, quotes like:I want to be with someonewho dreams of doing everything in life,and nothingon a rainy Sunday afternoon.I do love to get nostalgic on those occasions, though. Maybe with some book I have had read for a zillionth time.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33208115-love-her-wild,Love Her Wild.txt

The Collected Poems,"Sylvia Plath was an American poet, novelist, and short story writer, widely regarded as one of the most influential and emotionally powerful authors of the 20th century. Born in Boston, Massachusetts, she demonstrated literary talent from an early age, publishing her first poem at the age of eight. Her early life was shaped by the death of her father,Otto Plath, when she was eight years old, a trauma that would profoundly influence her later work.Plath attended Smith College, where she excelled academically but also struggled privately with depression. In 1953, she survived a suicide attempt, an experience she later fictionalized in her semi-autobiographical novel The Bell Jar. After recovering, she earned a Fulbright Scholarship to study at Newnham College, Cambridge, in England. While there, she met and married English poetTed Hughesin 1956. Their relationship was passionate but tumultuous, with tensions exacerbated by personal differences and Hughes's infidelities.Throughout her life, Plath sought to balance her ambitions as a writer with the demands of marriage and motherhood. She had two children with Hughes, Frieda and Nicholas, and continued to write prolifically. In 1960, her first poetry collection, The Colossus and Other Poems, was published in the United Kingdom. Although it received modest critical attention at the time, it laid the foundation for her distinctive voice—intensely personal, often exploring themes of death, rebirth, and female identity.Plath's marriage unraveled in 1962, leading to a period of intense emotional turmoil but also extraordinary creative output. Living with her two children in London, she wrote many of the poems that would posthumously form Ariel, the collection that would cement her literary legacy. These works, filled with striking imagery and raw emotional force, displayed her ability to turn personal suffering into powerful art. Poems like ""Daddy"" and ""Lady Lazarus"" remain among her most famous, celebrated for their fierce honesty and technical brilliance.In early 1963, following a deepening depression, Plath died by suicide at the age of 30. Her death shocked the literary world and sparked a lasting fascination with her life and work. The posthumous publication of Ariel in 1965, edited by Hughes, introduced Plath's later poetry to a wide audience and established her as a major figure in modern literature. Her novel The Bell Jar was also published under her own name shortly after her death, having initially appeared under the pseudonym ""Victoria Lucas.""Plath’s work is often classified within the genre of confessional poetry, a style that emphasizes personal and psychological experiences. Her fearless exploration of themes like mental illness, female oppression, and death has resonated with generations of readers and scholars. Over time, Plath has become a feminist icon, though her legacy is complex and occasionally controversial, especially in light of debates over Hughes's role in managing her literary estate and personal history.Today, Sylvia Plath is remembered not only for her tragic personal story but also for her immense contributions to American and English literature. Her work continues to inspire writers, artists, and readers worldwide. Collections such as Ariel, Crossing the Water, and Winter Trees, as well as her journals and letters, offer deep insight into her creative mind. Sylvia Plath’s voice, marked by its intensity and emotional clarity, remains one of the most haunting and enduring in modern literature.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2078076.The_Collected_Poems,The Collected Poems.txt

She writes an exhaustive lament for mothers of the ""dark magicians,"" and revisits the devastating murder of Emmett Till. These dynamic sequences serve as a backdrop for present-day racial calamities and calls for resistance. Smith embraces elaborate and eloquent language— ""her gorgeous fallen son a horrid hidden / rot. Her tiny hand starts crushing roses—one by one / by one she wrecks the casket’s spray. It’s how she / mourns—a mother, still, despite the roar of thorns""— as she sharpens her unerring focus on incidents of national mayhem and mourning. Smith envisions, reenvisions, and ultimately reinvents the role of witness with an incendiary fusion of forms, including prose poems, ghazals, sestinas, and sonnets. With poems impossible to turn away from, one of America’s most electrifying writers reveals what is frightening, and what is revelatory, about history.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29993412-incendiary-art,Incendiary Art Poems.txt
The Broken Word,"This is a narrative poem of 61 pages in which Foulds describes the experience of a young man who has just finished school and who is returning home until it is time to take up his place at university, probably either Oxford or Cambridge.So far, so relatively unexceptional. But the youth in question, Tom, is white and British, home is in Kenya, and the time is 1953 during the Mau Mau rebellion. And thus the young man and his family - father, mother, and his sister Kate with whom he gets on well, perhaps ‘swimmingly’ might be the word – is pressured into the social role of defence volunteer and upholder of British values, of law and order, and of European hegemony over the black man – especially when it comes to defending land seized from the Africans as the self-declared right of the colonizer.Suffice it to say, he learns to kill and is brutalized by witnessing the casual racist cruelty of the detention camps run by the British for Mau Mau prisoners. Eventually he hears the camp commander declare of a resisting prisoner ‘“This one’s just bought a ticket to Compound Nine”’. (Although Tom has not been in Compound Nine he knows it is the worst of the worst because he has seen the men who are returned from it where they have been under the supervision of “specialists”.) Foulds’ laconic line that follows - ‘“Oh no he hasn’t,” Tom whispered’ - is followed by an event that leads to Tom’s being retired from the volunteers.The narrative concludes during Tom’s first year at university where he is studying Classics:‘Bright metalwork of Trojans, Danaans,well-greaved Achaeansbuckling and unbucklingover an abstract planeas he went over and over,adjusting his translation.’Of course, he is adjusting his own translation from that of a semi-war footing in a foreign land (where his ‘home’ still is) to an environment of cultivated quiet studiousness where he is expected to study a text about warfare, and he is not finding it easy. He has violent dreams about his tutor and a coal shovel. He witnesses a pub fight with a girlfriend and finds himself shocking her, and himself, by saying “They’re not hurting each other…If you want to see them hurt / I know how to make them suffer,” and later he is sexually aggressive with the same girlfriend. Nevertheless, his sensitivity is not utterly lost to him. Distraught at her coolness and indifference to him afterwards, Foulds’ sub-text allows us to see Tom beginning to know that he must hold fast to that which is good about himself and human experience, and come to terms with what he has felt pressured to do elsewhere.I have some reservations about this sort of subject matter as used by those for whom the events described are history. (Foulds was born in 1974.) Nevertheless, what Foulds does is take the historical reality and use it as a poet should – to say something important to society. In this case it is to offer us the chance to encounter both the appalling things human beings are capable of and the capacity we have to heal. Lord knows, the latter is not always achievable, as evidenced in Tom’s father whose experience in WW2 has affected him so deeply, he is understood by the rest of his fellow expatriates to be excused defence duties. But Foulds’ story also considers the power of fear and courage, the pressures of social expectation, the dreadful strength of parental emotional blackmail and the disgraceful misuse of religion. I was stirred emotionally, and felt the need to think through what I had read.Finally, Foulds’ adopts a paragraphed, short-line free-verse form that makes his narrative very readable. But though the verse is free, there is a sense that it is tautly put together, well honed, anything gratuitous edited out. For the most part it is strikingly plain - prosy might one say? – in its styling, as one might expect from a novel -‘Two more numbers were called.The five were led out,past three prisoners up to their necksin the ground for a minor offence…’- but then an unexpected image will be used to sharpen the impression –‘…their heads sticking up like croquet hoops.’ (Personally, I think the facts speak more than enough, though maybe Foulds wants us to understand that Tom’s mental state is deteriorating into seeing the brutal as ludicrous.)And then the poetic urge towards imagery will sometimes take over to re-engage the reader –‘Arm high over his head, he flexedhis little black leather biblelike a muscle sprung from his body.His centre-parted hair flappedits stumpy wings as he jerked,his pale lips gymnastic.’Anyway, for me, this approach to writing a mini-epic worked well, and shows what the imagination at its most focused can achieve. ‘The Broken Word’ is well worth trying, but be warned, it’s not a comfortable journey.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1674116.The_Broken_Word,The Broken Word.txt
Antipoems: How to Look Better and Feel Great,"Is this guy really still alive at 102? That's what the internet says.Chilean poet Nicanor Parra was considered by Roberto Bolano to be the ""best living Spanish-language poet,"" and his many admirers on both sides of the Equator have included Neruda, Mistral, William Carlos Williams, Ferlinghetti, Ginsberg, and Merwin. According to biographer Frank MacShane, Parra's career as a mathematician and physicist may have influenced his poetry in the following ways: (1) his study of the theory of relativity made him hyperaware of the importance of a person's subjectivity and positionality in interpreting events, (2) he preferred to focus on real-world topics, (3) his no-frills writing style was not entirely dissimilar to that in which mathematical theorems are expressed, and (4) his ongoing connection to a world beyond the literary academe may have been one of the factors motivating him to write poetry aimed at readers who do not usually read poetry. MacShane also seems to insinuate that Parra's experiences growing up with an alcoholic guitarist father may have turned him against the use of florid musicality in poetry, perhaps having a hand in leading him to develop his characteristically spare writing style.This is a selection of Parra's poems dated between 1955 and 1985, presented bilingually (the English translations alongside the Spanish originals, which is the only way I can seem to read Spanish-language poetry nowadays). The earliest poems, those of Parra's groundbreaking collectionPoemas y antipoemas, have long stanzas comprised of long lines, suffused with that kind of sneering irony that seems so rare in U.S. poetry and which I've therefore come to associate with the French. Parra's ""Advertencia al lector"" nods at Baudelaire's ""Au lecteur"" (of ""mon semblable, mon frere"" fame), while his ""Recuerdos de juventud"" recalls Rimbaud's ""Les poetes de sept ans."" Parra's ""Conversacion galante"" is explicitly in conversation with Verlaine's ""Colloque sentimental"" and Laforgue's ""Pierrots."" Parra's line ""But why rake deeper into this wretched affair?"" would fit well into Baudelaire's oeuvre, purpled as it is by sordidness and ennui (but also, perhaps, presagesAndrew Wiles's ""I think I'll stop here""?).This is an irony that directs its sneer both outward and inward, conjuring a snake that eats its own tail, gets increasingly drunk on its own poison, and then goes off on long-winded (but always winkingly self-aware) tirades while thus intoxicated. Consider, for example, the simultaneously self-mythologizing and self-mocking tone of the passage Merwin translates as: ""A soul that has been bottled up for years / In a sort of sexual and intellectual abyss, / Nourishing itself most inadequately through the nose, / Desires to be heard."" All the Nietzschean talk of abysses sets us readers up for a self-serious revelation, but then that ludicrous nose image comes along, making us readers realize that nothing here was as serious as it first seemed. On the surface, these poems have an aura of self-loathing Confessional intimacy, and yet on further examination they contain few particulars that would incriminate any individual person, but instead seem to be thinly disguised efforts to sketch the universal.The collection ends with the terser, more aphoristic poems Parra gravitated to in the '80s, soundbite-like jottings that remind me of Jane Hirshfield's concept of ""poems of pure statement,"" such as this untitled gem about mathematician-philosopher Bertrand Russell translated by David Unger:Bertrand Russell was once askedwhat he thought of old ageThe FatherSonand Holy Ghost of Ecology answered:old agejust another stage of lifein which to fight for a just causeHaving been a scientist in the 20th century, a time of many cataclysmic changes and paradigm shifts in science, not least that which was occasioned by the invention of the atomic bomb, Parra is ambivalent about science's contributions to society. In ""Soliloquio del individuo [The Individual's Soliloquy],"" translated by Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Allen Ginsburg, the narrator -- an archetypical character called ""the Individual"" who stands in for all of human civilization -- casually narrates the ethically suspect, racially violent, ecologically destructive forward march of technological progress over the centuries: ""Colored guys [tipos de color] entered the valley, / But I had to keep going, / Had to produce. / Produced science, immutable truths,...."" Parra also expresses doubt that science can ever answer the must fundamental existential questions: ""They teach us that space doesn't exist // They teach us that time doesn't exist / But all the same / Old age is a fact of life.""Parra's frequent flirtation with absurdism, especially as a counterweight or antidote to the classical ""bourgeois"" world, could be argued to follow logically from the early/mid-20th-century discoveries of quantum physics. For instance, the poem ""Mil novecientos treinta [Nineteen-Thirty],"" as translated by Miller Williams, grapples with the Heisenbergian idea that there is no such thing as an innocent neutral observer who does not bear some responsibility for what he is ""passively"" observing:I offer nothing special, I don't develop theoriesI'm only a camera swinging over the desert....I don't understate nor exalt anything.I simply tell what I see....Thousands of Croatian and Slovenian terrorists are executed en masse behind my backI let it happen, I let it passI let the murders go on quietly....Parra's poems have some features that make them, for me personally, less enjoyable than they would otherwise be -- in particular, an ongoing undercurrent of apparent revulsion toward the female (see, for example, the following poems: ""El tunel,"" ""La trampa,"" ""Los vicios del mundo moderno,"" ""La vibora,"" ""Las tablas,"" ""Momias,"" ""Conversacion galante,"" and ""El anti-Lazaro,"" as well as the crassness of the ending of ""La cruz""). I can tolerate this quality in literature up to a certain point, but after it's piled too deep and too high, it starts to seem like an unignorably distracting flaw in the writer's psyche, a blind spot that keeps the poems from achieving the heights of wisdom and insight they might otherwise have a shot at. And, when put together with the biographical anecdote about how a young Parra leapt uninvited onto the stage at an event celebrating the Chilean woman writer Gabriela Mistral to read one of his own poems, it just kind of leaves a bad taste in one's mouth. Still, there's a lot to ponder and enjoy here. My favorite poems, besides the Bertrand Russell one, included""El hombre imaginario""and also#20 of the ""Sermones y predicas del Cristo de Elqui.""",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/572207.Antipoems,Antipoems How to Look Better and Feel Great.txt

In other words, free verse has no rhythm scheme or pattern. However, much poetic language and devices are found in free verse.Rhyme may or may not be used in free verse, but, when rhyme is used, it is used with great freedom. In other words, free verse has no rhyme scheme or pattern.Free verse does not mean rhyme cannot be used, only that it must be used without any pattern.so, for example, a poem like this:cannot be deemed ""free verse"" because there is anattemptat patterned rhyme, it's just poorly done. if you're going to make the effort to rhyme, follow through and be consistent. otherwise, the reader will find the hiccup grating and it just ruins any emotional connection you may have had to the poem because you are taken out of the moment and you have to start over and see what the hell happened. if you're going to choose to be rhyme-y - BE RHYME-Y - you can't go rogue in the middle or the end of a poem. find a way to make it work or abandon the idea of rhyme scheme altogether if it's clipping your wings, because honestly - greeting card rhyme patterns do not a sophisticated poem make, and i don't understand her commitment to this style when she can't even seem to do it correctly half of the time.this one, okay, this one IS free verse - hooray.but here, leaving aside the jejeune sentiment and the tra la la of it, which may be appealing to some readers, there's a structural problem here in the scansion; the way the reader is led along by the nose in a consistent cadence and meter until that off-putting stumble over the finish line. it's terrible execution and shows complete disregard for the reader.and this is something that occurs frequently throughout this collection - one lazy rhyme in the middle of a poem that otherwise has a very rigid rhyme scheme which throws the whole thing off. or one dissonant rhythm break that makes you wince.it's not just the rhyme scheme and scansion - there's also just plain lousy editing.this is the second poem in the book. ""i would not nearly had so much"" is not the way you want to introduce a collection.but wait, there's more!this book also contains a number of prose pieces, many of which are trying so hard to be clever and conceptual through the conceit of personifying abstractions (Patience and Love agreed to meet at a set time and place; beneath the twenty-third tree in the olive orchard), but they're so forced and artless. capitalizing a word does not automatically make it meaningful. you gotta supply the meaning with the other words.There was a girl named Despondency, who loved a boy named Altruistic, and he loved her in return.for grammatical/semantic balance, shouldn't that be ""altruism""? or ""despondent?"" noun/noun or adjective/adjective? this is what is so frustrating - it's all surface-pretty, but utterly thoughtless. you can be as surprising or poetic as you like, but there should also be lyrical elegance. there's no sense that any effort went into the writing of these, no going back and rereading to make sure these words work together. it's all churn with no meaning.and jesus, this:that is the complete poem. and it's a mess. analogies are meant to be gracefully balanced comparisons of the relationships between disparate things. (hot is to cold as fire is to ice) but this one is ass-backwards, as anyone studying for the sats could tell you. i assume she's riffing off the adage that ""time heals all wounds."" and she's aware that a suture is used to close a wound, which is a literal comparison to the metaphorical healing that time performs. but in the syntax she's using here, she's basically saying that ""wounds heal all sutures."" which is incorrect. and i'm sure she thought it sounded pretty and was so darn proud of her rhyme she thought no one would notice how sloppy and illogical it was. but i certainly did.these instances of ""i am making pretty words say things that sound kinda smart and poetical"" but make no sense occur frequently, likeSometimes when I read a book, parts will lift from the pages in an anagram of your name. Like a code to remind me it's not over. Like dyslexia in reverse, which makes my head hurt too much to even begin to parse.and it goes on and on - incomplete thoughts, missing words, elisions:how they easily WHAT?what is the ""it"" here; the reason for their being? does this refer to ""time is told by seeing?"" so - ""time is told by seeing"" is the reason for the existence of clocks? what the shit does that mean and why did this insight necessitate a poem?leaving aside the fact that a circle IS a line, are we supposed to fill in the blanks ourselves? ""towards"" is a preposition and requires a noun or a pronoun to complete the thought, which i assume in this case is ""you,"" but again - really sloppy syntax. and this is what is so galling and made me so furious reading this collection - the sacrifice of meaning for the sake of rhythm in some instances, while so frequently being cavalier about maintaining consistent rhythm in others.more slipshod scansion, more jacked-up sentence structure. to compete with? to compete for? to compete in? finish your thought.and i know that some people love these poems because OMG the feels. and maybe this is a generational thing or a byproduct of people who get book deals based on their internet popularity where there is less editorial oversight, and maybe my complaints about this put me in the same category as people who complain about the infantilization of america with its grown men in baseball caps and those kids and their video games and how all the pop stars are under the drinking age and that's not music why in my day and get off my lawn. but maybe it's just disgust at the fact that people are willingly shelling out seventeen dollars for a hundred or so carelessly-written poems, many of which do not exceed eight lines, and it's the poetic equivalent of nursery food.and that is what i thought of this book.and i know i'm gonna have all these people come out and tell me how much they liked this book and how it changed their life and how wrong i am for scrutinizing it because poetry is like rainbows and it is immune to judgment. and yay for you if you liked this and it had value for you, sincerely. but opinions and an asshole - i have both. and even my asshole thought this collection was unsophisticated and sloppy.*************************************************2014:pulitzer prize nominee maya angelou, in the year of her death, writes a poem commemorating the life of nobel peace prize recipient nelson mandela, (who died in december 2013, but that's pretty much 2014), and we honor their lives by allowing this to win the 2014 goodreads best poetry award?:StayThe words I heardfrom you today,are said whenthere's nothingleft to say.What I would giveto make you stay,I would give itall away.i was hoping i wouldn't have to read this, but goodreads voters have forced my hand.i'll let you know if it's any good.come to my blog!",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22151696-lullabies-volume-2,Lullabies (Volume 2).txt
Letters to a Young Poet,"Many weeks went by before an answer came. The letter with its blue seal bore a Paris postmark, weighed heavy in the hand and displayed on the envelope the same clarity, beauty and assurance of hand with which the content itself was written from the first line to the last. And so my regular correspondence with Rainer Maria Rilke began, lasting until 1908 and then gradually petering out because life forced me into domains which the poet's war, tender and moving concern had precisely wanted to protect me from. But that is unimportant. The only important thing is the ten letters that follow, important for the insight they give into the world in which Rainer Maria Rilke lived and worked, and important too for many people engaged in growth and change, today and in the future, And where a great and unique person speaks, the rest of us should be silent.So concludes the letter that Kappus wrote in Berlin 1929 explaining how he came to write to Rilke. A chaplain saw him reading Rilke's poetry in 1902 and informed him that Rilke had also been a cadet at their military school. Kappus wrote to Rilke, presumably asking for advice about his poetry. The only letters published in my volume at Rilke's responses to Kappus' unseen messages. Rilke even tells him,I cannot go into the nature of your verses, for any critical intention is too remote from me.One would be forgiven for inferring the 19-year-old's letters were tentative, like a chick exploring the outside of the nest for the first time. But Rilke still dives deeper into what Kappus is telling him. And this is where my existential crisis began.Rainer Maria Rilke, Encyclopaedia BritannicaI turned 31 a few days ago and I feel strange reading such wisdom from someone who is two years younger than me. The fact that this is from 1902 notwithstanding. Rilke tells Kappus that he's making a mistake comparing his writing to that of other writers, the responses of editors. I recently made a magazine submission, yes I am a writer in real life, and while they rejected my entry, they did say thatUnfortunately, this piece won't work for [us] but we wish you the best in placing your essay/story elsewhere. We found much to admire in your essay, and we encourage you to continue to your work.I did wonder what they meant by that, going as far as spiralling down a rabbit hole, bothering friends who don't understand the specifics of editorials until I eventually gave up. But Rilke had something for me,...give up all that. You are looking to the outside, and that above all you should not be doing now. Nobody can advise you and help you, nobody. There is only one way. Go into yourself. Examine the reason that bids you to write; check whether it reaches its roots into the deepest region of your heart, admit to yourself whether you would die if it should be denied you to write...This sounds dangerous, especially as advice for someone who just started artistry. There needs to be room for flexibility and an acceptance of the volatility of humanity.Rilke himself was in military service and made the time to write. Others aren't so lucky. But this doesn't dissuade Rilke from stressing all this dogma upon Kappus. Sometimes it felt that all his conviction came from patriarchal thinking rather than life experience. Rilke was a worshipper of loneliness. I, too, am a hermit. As the great Edmund Blackadder once intimated, the only way to be sure of intelligent conversation is to spend time talking to yourself. In his 1903 letter he says,love your solitude and bear the pain it causes you with melody wrought with lament.There's a lot to appreciate in this little book, from Rilke's appreciation of place,you slowly learn to recognize the very few things in which something everlasting be felt, something you can love, something solitary in which you can take part in silence.on solitudeits growth is painful like the growth of boys and sad like the beginning of springon adultingThink, dear Mr Kappus, of the world that you carry within you, and call this thinking whatever you like. Whether it is memory of your own childhood or longing for your own future - just be attentive towards what rises up inside you, and place it above everything that you notice round about. What goes on in your innermost being is worth all your love, this is what you must work on however you can and not waste too much time and energy clarifying your attitude to other people.And a few paragraphs later,adults are nothing and their dignity has no worth.This reminded me of the need for embarrassment instilled in us as children. I remember being scolded for being curious enough to ask questions then being scolded again for being quiet when I should participate. The imagined indignities suffered by adults of stunted imagination struck upon us a need to follow rigid routines and eventually shackled us to a life where all we do is grow, eat, work, sleep and if you have the range for it, reproduce more people to enter the chain.But perhaps the letter I found most impressive was where he spoke about love, and romance. Many people end up in loveless relationships that amount to acrimony and hatred all because they fear loneliness.They act out of a shared helplessness, and if they do their best to escape the convention they happen to have noticed (as marriage for example), they fall into the clutches of a less obvious but just as deadly conventional solution...Rilke also espouses the inevitable change that will be people living their lives outside of the heteropatriarchal norms,Do not believe that that abundance of love which was once, as a boy, bestowed on you is now lost.This book is full of casual wisdom and profound insight. But often it felt like affirmation of that which I already believe. There are even times I felt scolded,Why should you want to exclude from your life all unsettling, all pain, all depression of spirit, when you don't know what work it is these states are performing within you? Why do you want to persecute yourself with the question of where it all comes from and where it is leading? You well know you are in a period of transition and want nothing more than to be transformed.Does this mean that every little owie life gives me is meant to have meaning? I don't know. But like Ursula K Le Guin said,the truth that I recognize in suffering as I don’t in comfort and happiness — that the reality of pain is not pain. If you can get through it. If you can endure it all the way.But Rilke likens pain to a fever. Sickness is how the body gets rid of foreign microbes. He even gives a step by step tutorial on what to do:1. Do not watch yourself too closely.2. Do not draw over-rapid conclusions from what is happening to you. Simply let it happen. Otherwise you will too readily find yourself looking on your past.3. Be very careful with names; it is so often the name of a crime which destroys a life, not the nameless and personal act itself...4. If it doesn't cease to be difficult, it doesn't cease to grow.5. Do not think the person trying to console you lives effortlessly.6. If life wasn't full of troubles and sadness, you wouldn't be able to find the words to create.(Ps. some of these are paraphrased.)This book can be very helpful to people coming into their own. Especially authors whether starting out or in the middle of their careers. I will think of you often Rilke, with such a concentration of gratitude for this merest of gut punches,Art too is only a way of living, and it is possible, however one lives, to prepare oneself for it without knowing...",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46199.Letters_to_a_Young_Poet,Letters to a Young Poet.txt
Crush,"This is a grief-stricken, painfully loving, violently obsessive collection that feels like a frantic stream of consciousness, with each poem twining together to create a story in feelings. It’s a bit fragmented at times, lending to the air of desperation. It doesn’t feel as though Siken is composing these words as much as they are flowing out of him uncontrollably and it is a matter of life and death that he gets all the words down. These poems are the grief of a mourning man put into words. They are his shame, his fears, his longing, his loneliness. There is a violence associated with this love because of the circumstances of it and the self-hating that can come with being queer in a time/place that it is not accepted that reminds me quite a bit of the violent thoughts inThese Violent Delights, which I found to be especially prominent in “Wishbone” and “Driving, Not Washing”. There is so much content in these poems, but it all whittles down to Siken’s raw emotions, which overpower the narrative, as his cyclical writing forces us to go round and round with him on this repetitive ride that he is stuck in.Louise Glück writes an incredible forward for this collection and I can’t say it better than her when she said: “That Silken turns life into art seems, in these poems, psychological imperative rather than literary ploy: the poems substitute the repeating cycles of ritual for linear progressive time—in Crush, the bullet enters the body and then returns to the gun. . . the poems are driven by what they deny; their ferocity attests to the depth of their terror, their resourcefulness to the intractability of the enemy's presence.""Below, I’ve copied down some excerpts and full poems that I really love.

And Yet: Poems,"Life comes at you fast. There never seems to be enough time in the day for all the joys and sorrows it may bring, enough time for all the work, reading, laughter or quality time with loved one. ‘If only we could put the world on hold,’ Kate Baer muses in her third collection of poetry,And Yet, and demonstrates how, perhaps, we can very well do so through poetry. Poetry puts a moment on pause and allows you to open it up, unpack the viscera of emotions and examine the bones of living, and across this volume we watch Baer chronicle many moments worth pausing on. The poems here gaze inwards to capture Baer’s self-reflections, particularly on motherhood and marriage, as well as outward to discuss topics like misogyny and the COVID pandemic. It's a bit light and could certainly go deeper, but the quick flashes of recognizable emotions seem to be the aim and in that it succeeds. Through the highs and lows, Baer asks us ‘to witness one / life’s miserable devastation and / see her reach, instead, for joy,’ and delivers it all in succinct poetry full of humor and wit.IdeaI will enjoy this life. I will open itlike a peach in season, suck the juicefrom every finger, run my tongue overmy chin. I will not worry about clichésor uninvited guests peering in my windows.I will love and be loved. Save and be saveda thousand times. I will let the want intomy body, bless the heat under my skin.My life, I will not waste it. I will enjoy this life.This is a short collection and many of the poems are quite short, but they also pack a lot of emotion within them. Baer became an instant hit with her 2020 debut,What Kind of Woman, full of strong feminist themes and empowering reflections that were wonderfully succinct and quotable, making them ideal posts to be shared and reshared on social media as a very difficult year was coming to a close. Her honest examinations of womanhood and criticisms of misogyny in her book of poems as well as her online blog received a lot of pushback and toxic responses which, in the mindset of the maxim about when life hands you lemons, she creatively transformed into poetic lemonade through erasure poems or poetic retellings of these emails in her second collectionI Hope This Finds You Well. Here we return to more to the style of her first collection, though poems such asReasons to Log Offthat discusses the cruelty of strangers on the internet keeps her second book always close to mind as well. The poems vary across settings and scenarios like putting kids to bed, hating a move to a new home, waiting in a COVID testing facility, or simply feeling the exhaustion of life. But not everything is harsh examinations or poems about grief. Baer has a fun sense of humor, such as poems like ‘Writing Poems High/On Twitter’, or exploring alternative words to make the slang acronym ”Milf” (ending on ‘Mother I’d like to free’) or even that her headstone should one day read ‘Honestly just a really good time.’ There is a wonderful balance of emotions that keep this collection feeling light and playful amidst all the grief.‘How foolish we are / to believe what we love won’t end.’Baer gives a lot of space for introspection here, or, as she puts it. to ‘walk down to the river of myself / and see what I have always known.’ These poems are often easy to identify with or laugh with, which makes them quite catching. ‘Where are the poems / about the grief of two ordinary people / who fell in love?’ she asks, opting to write them herself with poetry about ordinary and everyday life carrying both joy and grief. There are close-ups of marriage, not shirking away from flaws and failures while still capturing moments of coziness and peace, and plenty of thoughts on parenthood wondering what we can actually pass along to children when we, as adults, are caught in the mess of a society we often make messier. But most of all, Baer captures moments when the walls are down and the armor is off and we can’t do anything but face ourselves.‘You ask me my intentionsbut darling, I have none.I only have desire.’This is a quick and fun collection that will certainly please fans and likely attract newcomers as these poems seem destined for social media feeds much like the first collection. Baer naturally gets comparisons toRupi Kaur, and does feel like a more matured and formal few steps further than the insta-poetry scene that was quite popular a few years ago while still having a similar shareability. They can seem a bit slight, but the accessibility is nice and welcoming, and anyone can find something to identify with in these pages.And Yetreminds us to pause on moments and drink deeply from them to get the most out of life.3.5/5If You Were to Ask for the Secret to a Happy Marriageafter Leah Naomi GreenI would tell you how the fire beetle matesonly when the chaparral is burning.How the prologue changes when youwrite the second act.

Might Kindred,"An electrifying work of queer poetry, lyrics from a precise mind that never overstay their welcome, even with several over one page. Every word is essential, every piece is essential, and the technical virtuosity on display here ensures that Mónica Gomery will prove to be a vital voice in contemporary poetry. In a collection of standout poems it is always difficult to pinpoint highlights without copy and pasting the entire poem to convey its cumulative effect. Several poems moved me to tears and forced me to pause and reread to fully grasp the weight of the piece. In ""Prologue"", which sits around the end of the first fifth, ""The confusion I have felt; the trades my people have made for safety; someone else's / grief. Blue sifting into blue"", forms the closest device this work has to a thesis. ""Here"" is a stunning look at how a small town responds to, and is complicit in gun violence, ""The alderman uses the word loitering to deliver a violence against the people who've lived here for many years longer than you have."" My favorite poem, and what I feel is very much the centerpiece, is ""God Queers The Mountain, which follows ""Here"". It is one such poem that a quotation pulled from its context would be a direct injustice. The pieces ranks among the greatest poems on queer identity, struggle, and persistence. I look forward to this work's publication and I cannot wait to see the poetic magic Gomery cooks up next.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60114113-might-kindred,Might Kindred.txt
"The World Keeps Ending, and the World Goes On","‘Lord, I confess I want the clarity of catastrophe but not the catastrophe.Like everyone else, I want a storm I can dance in.I want an excuse to change my life.’The apocalypse of the present has become ‘so loud we finally stopped hearing it,’ warns poet and activist Franny Choi in her third collection,The World Keeps Ending, and the World Goes On. A hard hitting collection that centers on concepts of endings, Choi blissfully incorporates the aesthetics of science fiction into her poetry, crafting landscapes of the now as dystopian wastelands that make this read with a rather epic sense of urgency. ‘Grief's a heavy planet’ and Choi takes us through the horrors of the past and present and asks us what the future will hold. There are difficult questions poetically posed, moving between global scales wondering if it is already ‘too late for the earth / to yield anything but more corpses,’ to more personal examinations of identity such as when she asks ‘am I the colonization or the reparations?(she adds later ‘I choose to be the reparations’).The World Keeps Ending, and the World Goes Onis a powerful collection of socio-political criticisms, and examinations of history and cultural identity that delivers lines that will knock you right over and others that will tug your heartstrings with such an urgency that you cannot, and should not, look away.‘Sliced from bone, my lifeHung like a jaw—faultless. AndUnforgivable.’The weight of history hangs heavy in each of these poems, moving across atrocities of war—such as the dropping of the atomic bombs which figure into several poems—mass refugee and immigration movements, and even into the present with poems addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. While the amalgamation of traumas and troubles is often thought to be leading towards an impending apocalypse, Choi asks us to consider that it has already happened.She shows how, for many marginalized peoples, they have been already living in a post-apocalyptic world for decades, such as in the title poem:‘[T]he apocalypse beganWhen Columbus praised God and lowered his anchor. It began when a continent was drawn into cutlets. It began when Kublai Khan told Marco,Begin at the beginning. By the time the apocalypse began, the world had already ended.’In aninterviewwith Alyssa Lo from Catapult, Choi says ‘it might be helpful to remember that the apocalypse happened a long time ago and that our people have survived it and have been surviving it for many years,’ and thus the collection, which builds itself around the title poem, looks at the sadness but also at the ‘unthinkably inventive modes of survival’. The ways in hardship people conclude ‘Why not / smother doubt to save the family / we’re responsible for.’The poemWith Mouths and Mushrooms, the Earth Will Accept Our Apology, for example, nods to the matsutake mushrooms that were the first living thing to come from the devastated landscape of Hiroshima after the bombing. Here, Choi contemplates the renewal of the natural world, with or without us, after humans have wrecked our environment. It reminded me of the hope in the final paragraph inCormac McCarthy’sThe Roadwhere the plant life begins to slowly return and ‘hummed of mystery.’ The hope in this book takes hold even through all the darkness.‘O beasts of fortune, I am loved sweetest by the horrors of blood,By my own, and by ours, blessed root rot, by ours.’Choi looks back to her ancestors frequently in this collection, as guides and as touchstones to moments in history. ‘Sometimes I wonder how long I’d have to run / to reach the last generation where one of us felt loved,’ she writes, feeling part of a lengthy legacy that has endured history but has been scarred in the process, ‘I come from a short line of women / who were handed husbands as salvation from rape.’ The legacy of misogyny and homophobia lurks in all the corners, even language as in one poem Choi looks at how the term ‘comfort woman’—Korean girls who were kidnapped and put into sexual servitude for the Japanese army during WWII—was a phrase to comfort the perpetrators of sexual violence, linguistically softening the connotation of their actions where the term ‘sexual slavery’ would have shed more truth. ‘Whatever helps you bear the day // whatever sweet, what touch’ Through it all, however, Choi builds a hope for the future as a way to bear the legacy into a new light, and hopefully we will all survive the many apocalypses that are to come.But what sort of legacy are we leaving? InProtest Poem, she considers the ‘as-yet-unbuilt museum/ of what we had to survive / to make paradise/ from its ruins,’ what artifacts of today will we leave behind, and what will it say of our present. InScience Fiction Poem, she lists the many minor ‘dystopias’ of our daily living, causing us to look around us in a new framing and acknowledge what we endure. This can be comical, such as in another she considers how with the world heading towards political and environmental disaster, we look away and fill our time with online shopping. Though one of her most powerful poems,Field Trip to the Museum of Human History, addresses the legacy of police brutality where ‘In America, there were no greater / protections from police than wealth and whiteness.’ Partly inspired byThe DispossessedbyUrsula K. Le Guin, Choi herself has been a prison abolition advocate and it makes its way into the hope that is central to her work.‘You don’t haveTo believe in something for it to startle you awake.’With poems that either grip you by the throat or the heart,The World Keeps Ending, and the World Goes Onis a dazzling and chilling collection of poetry. The dives through history are dark, but Choi never leaves us without a hint of hope for light at the other end of the tunnel.4.5/5",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60147181-the-world-keeps-ending-and-the-world-goes-on,"The World Keeps Ending, and the World Goes On.txt"
Poems I Wrote When No One Was Looking,"These 100 poems will have kid-appeal, and it's practically a guarantee that each of your students will find more than one to like. What makes the verses so funny is that some of them are downright silly and perfect for children. Upper elementary and middle graders are sure to smile at ""Fridge-a-Dare"" with its lines about what happens to grapes lost in a bedroom or ""Shhhhh..."" that describes someone overwhelmed by noise and ""onomatopoeiaing"" (p. 36). Part of the book's appeal derives from the clever poem titles too; many of them have double meanings and can be taken in several ways. The pen illustrations complement the poems quite well, caricaturing children in different ways. Who knew that school, libraries, and museums could be so much fun?

The Collected Poems,"An unsurpassed collection of poems full of breathtaking beauty, dazzling use of music, majestic pride and celebration of the human spirit! I read the book as part of a course I took on Langston Hughes work from August to December of last year. Now that I have finished college, I can finally write this review. The poems explore the complexity of Hughes own character and the events of his own time. What really struck me about the poems was how they centered on an array of different subjects and are able to look beyond their own time forecasting what we will face in ours. The incredible life-span story of Hughes and the experiences which inspired many of his famous poems also was interesting to me. ""The Negro Speaks of Rivers"" is one of my favorites of Hughes poems because of its collective representation, the separation of the individual with ""My"" and its message of survival and perseverance. The poem was also significant to me as a Mulatto person through the nostalgic, reverent, unifying and historical pride at the heart of it. I loved how Hughes really chronicled the history of Africa's roots through the rivers that have played roles in the story of African peoples journey from their homeland to the USA. ""The Weary Blues"" is lyrical with alliteration, rhyme, couplets and slam rhymes most effective. The uses of Standard American English and Blues language was also interesting. Under the surface of the depressive shroud of the poem, it carries the theme of moving forward and never give in to depression and hardship. This poem certainly painted the picture of the constant stress Hughes needed to shake off but cannot escape. The poem ""Laughers"" is amazing because it addresses the struggles of the common working African-American person. The appreciation of peoples culture past and present struck a chord with me and how each person has their own line in a sort of envelope structure. It was interesting how dancers, singers and laughers are indented twice. The poem provides a Blue Collar mentality in African-American culture, which is quite Geo-political. Two other poems from this collection that I liked were ""The Negro"" and ""My People."" The nature and labor-based imagery of those two are intriguing. They show how African-Americans laugh at Fate when an outside voice asks them why they are laughing. The poem has a proud tone to it. While Fate has the control in the end, ""Loud Laughers"" African-Americans make their own destiny whereas with the ""Loud-Mouthed"" it is out of their hands. ""Prayer"" is a brief rhetorical poem that addresses theological questions to God and answers them- which I think speaks volumes. it covers a huge religious scope with its tone transitions, confusion and decisiveness in a despondent way. Poems such as ""Jazz Band in a Parisian Cabaret"" illustrates the Jazz influence to a number of Hughes late poems as it switches between different languages, club atmosphere and romantic words. it is a very internationally generated poem. Another of Hughes poems that I enjoyed was ""Midwinter Blues"" with the use of a single verse sung only once, change in chord and singing in different lines. The tight rhyme scheme was well used too. Dialect is barely used in this poem in the romantic conflict with the female speaker, influenced by Blues culture. The poems in ""Fields of Wonder"" are both spectacular with their unparalleled language and awesome power. They address important topics ranging from pain, suffering, death, natural seasons and expression of feeling. The poems are universal and lyrical through Hughes use of music and exclusion of racial and political arguments. The movement, ambivalence and emphasis placed on the self makes the poems in that collection rousing. The poem ""One Way Ticket"" in contrast is optimistic, a welcome transition from the apparent dreariness in ""Fields of Wonder."" I liked the poem particularly for its movement, conversational dialogue and expression of feeling which Hughes often holds back in most of his writings. It is simple and direct on stereotypical subjects using humor, rhythm and Blues. ""Ode to Dinah"" I liked for its use of non-natural imagery, flow and the ""quarter of time"" symbolized by a coin. It focuses on Communism and economics very clearly. Following this poem, ""Blues In Stereo"" also refers to time, referring to an ancient river and using natural elements in contrast to its predecessor. Its representation of poor people living in the wild as ""savage"" is very flat out as well as its allusion to Colonialism. The poem is a pleasurably messy one indeed. ""Horn of Plenty"" was sarcastic as it played on the African-American stereotypes. The poem even called integration a joke and represents the disparity between economics and class using $ and cents signs, It certainly addresses what is not wisely invested in and has yet to change, which are major issues in societies today. Hughes ""Gospel Cha-cha"" impressed me with its references to Afro-Haitian Voodoo religion, its heavy use of gospel music, natural imagery related to it as well as economics. ""Is it True"" is another poem that contains different cultural influences, particularly with Spanish language. While the poem is silent and briefly uses music, it addresses the voices that are not listened to, triumph over difficulty and African-American folk culture that is not recorded. ""Ask Your Mama""I thought was amazing with its references to different street addresses, swift movement and singularity. The poem raises the question"" Why speak a lesser language when you have more elegant ones? Its main assertion is the heart of the African-American community still beats strongly. The metaphor of Martin Luther as a Unicorn was interesting and the phrase repetitions of the poem drove it forward. ""Bird in Orbit"" encompassed similar details to ""Ask Your Mama"". ""Jazzet Muted"" spoke to me through its sense of loss, image of fire, darkness and the oppression of African-Americans. Hughes really expresses the anger let loose in the Juke Joint and Harlem club settings. ""Quarter of the Negroes"" is a poem immersed in music with African drums, piano, maracas and gospel references. The usage and mentions of foreign languages and countries certainly was cool along with popular cultural and political figures from Jazz artists, writers, revolutionaries to elected African presidents. ""Ride, Red, Ride"" used many of the same features but raised the question of how does a movement/change happen? ""Shades of Pigmeat"", a more comedic poem, turned negative facts positive while it addresses stereotypes and racial persecution through Hughes effective use of Satire. The poems of Hughes final book ""The Panther & the Lash"" while they seem like a less hopeful collection centers on the Civil Rights Movement and also Dope addiction. It represents the marginalization of the African-American population and impatience to see progress happen. Politically, Hughes last volume of poems is effective and while the tone is more militant, the poems contributed to the momentum of the Black Freedom Movement. This collection of Langston Hughes poems is a marvelous one, bringing together all of the pieces by one of the most renowned poets in American history. If you are not familiar with Hughes work, this book is a must-read for all people. The poems messages transcend nation, experience and circumstances.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/133906.The_Collected_Poems,The Collected Poems.txt
The Road Not Taken and Other Poems,"This is a short selection of poems by Robert Frost, who was born in San Francisco, California, in 1874. Although he is considered to be one of the greatest American poets of the twentieth century, his first collection,""A Boy's Will""was originally published in England in 1913, during the 3 short years when he lived in England, between 1912-1915. In England he made some important acquaintances, including Edward Thomas and Rupert Brooke, who were both member of the group of six known as the Dymock poets. For the few years just before the First World War these six poets went walking in the Malvern Hills, Herefordshire and across to Gloucestershire, discussing their poetry and reading. Frost also met T. E. Hulme and Ezra Pound. Back in the USA he went on to write many more highly regarded collections of poetry, winning 4 Pulitzer prizes for poetry and was eventually awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for his poetry in 1960. He died in Boston, Massachusetts in 1963.For English readers, the English connection and his English ancestry resonates, and much of the imagery used seems familiar. Usually it helps to have a frame of reference to assimilate all the nuances, but it is not quite so essential with Robert Frost's work. Nevertheless he is often more specific and localised, using colloquial American speech, with realistic depictions of rural life, specifically those in New England in the early 20th century. Frost had worked the farm for nine years while writing early in the mornings and producing many of the poems that would later become famous. Ultimately his farming proved unsuccessful and he returned to the field of education as an English teacher. His poetry can be read on many levels however, using these themes to examine complex social and philosophical issues. He has been thought of as the poet who hides the most, while appearing simple and obvious. Perhaps this explains his popularity as it is perfectly possible to enjoy the poem's imagery on a straightforward, superficial level, but there are hidden depths for those who want to find them.There follows a list of the thirteen poems in this collection, with the name and chronological order of the original collections. It can be seen that they span a broad range:The Road Not Taken (Mountain Interval, 1916)The Death of the Hired Man (North of Boston, 1914-15)The Mountain (North of Boston, 1914-15)Fire and Ice (New Hampshire, 1923)The Generations of Men (North of Boston, 1914-15)The Grindstone (New Hampshire, 1923)The Witch of Coos (New Hampshire, 1923)A Brook in the City (New Hampshire, 1923)Design (A Further Range, 1937)House Fear (Mountain Interval, 1916)The Lockless Door (New Hampshire, 1923)Storm Fear (A Boy's Will, 1913)Snow (Mountain Interval, 1916)The Road Not Taken, the first poem in his third collection of poems,""Mountain Interval""is perhaps one of Frost's most famous and well-loved poems. It is a narrative, with a strict metre and rhyme scheme. The final couplet,""I took the one less traveled by,And that has made all the difference""contains a clear message that there are always two choices in life.It is also autobiographical. Not many readers may know that it is a poem about the close friendship between Robert Frost and Edward Thomas. They frequently took long walks together through the countryside, sometimes with the other Dymock poets. As Frost himself put it, the poem is""a mild satire on the chronic vacillating habits of Edward Thomas"". He was amused over a familiar mannerism of Edward Thomas, who would often choose a route which might enable him to show his American friend a rare plant or special view. Invariably though, Thomas would regret his choice, sighing over what he might have shown Frost if they had taken a""better direction"".Since they were such good friends, it vividly illustrates the importance of irony in understanding much of Frost's work. For, sadly, Edward Thomas failed to see either Frost's irony - or himself as the subject of the poem - and despite his wife's belief that Frost never intended a serious criticism of his friend, it is thought to be a major contributing factor in Edward Thomas's decision to enlist in World War I. He was killed in battle 2 years later.The Death of the Hired Mancomes from Robert Frost's second book of poetry,""North of Boston"", although it had been written earlier, in 1905 or 1906. It is a long narrative poem in blank verse, consisting almost entirely of a conversation between Mary and Warren, her farmer-husband, but as critics have observed, Frost makes the prosaic patterns of their speech sound lyrical. To Ezra PoundThe Death of the Hired Manwas Frost at his best - when he""dared to write ... in the natural speech of New England; in natural spoken speech, which is very different from the ""natural"" speech of the newspapers, and of many professors.""Silas, an old workhand who used to help with the haymaking, had previously left the farm at an inconvenient time. Now though, he had returned during the Winter, looking, Mary says as she tries to appease Warren,""a miserable sight"". She feels sorry for him. The couple wrestle with their consciences as to what to do about the man who seems to view the farm as home, but is not welcome. A major theme in the poem is that of the ""home"" or homecoming and belonging, as well as justice, mercy, friendship, guilt, age and death.The much-quoted lines,""Home is the place where, when you have to go there,They have to take you in.""come fromThe Death of the Hired Man, although in the context of the dialogue they are said bitterly, and perhaps with a certain amount of sarcasm.The Mountainalso comes from the collection""North of Boston""and is also a narrative poem in blank verse. The narrator is staying in a village, where a large mountain dominates the sky. On a walk around and towards the mountain, he meets a farmer, and has a conversation with him. As they discuss the mountain, the farmer tells stories about it, and it becomes clear that he is trying to persuade the narrator to climb the mountain.By the end of the poem, the mountain has been so well described that the terrain seems familiar to anyone who has walked and climbed in mountainous or hilly areas. (To an English reader it might convey the mountains of the Lake Dictrict, for instance.) The narrator has been convinced to make the climb, although the reader is left wondering whether he did so. The farmer's last words are inaudible, as he has left the scene so abruptly.There are three elements, the description, the persuasiveness of the farmer, and the narrator's actions. It is possibly a poem about manipulation.Fire and Iceis a beautifully evocative short poem; highly structured and compact. One of Robert Frost's most popular poems, it is often found in anthologies. Although it was published in his fourth collection, entitled""New Hampshire""in 1923, it had been published earlier in a magazine in 1920. It discusses the end of the world, matching the elemental force of fire with the emotion of desire, and ice with hate.It was partly inspired by Dante's""Inferno"", and partly by a conversation Frost had had with the astronomer Harlow Shapley, who went on to quote it as""an example of how science can influence the creation of art, or clarify its meaning.""The Generations of Menis another blank verse narrative poem from""North of Boston""in 1914-1915. Two adolescent cousins meet accidentally at the Stark family reunion. They have a conversation which varies between being nostalgic and being speculative. They show intellectual curiosity and an appreciation of literature with references to Shakespeare and Homer. At one point they invent an imaginative character, Granny Stark, showing their sense of fun. Although the poem is set in the rain there seems to be the promise of sun. The poem is celebrating continuing generations, and perhaps could be broadened to represent the cycle of birth, death and rebirth for all humanity.The Grindstone, from the collection""New Hampshire"", published in 1923, is a poem about the feelings of a boy, who is reluctant to speak out in front of the man sharpening the scythe. It may be metaphorical musings about death. The grindstone would represent the speaker's life, having slowed down and being left out in the cold. The grim reaper comes around and wants to sharpen his scythe's blade. The speaker tries to help by running the grindstone faster and almost ruins the blade, which makes him laugh.The Witch of Coösalso comes from the collection""New Hampshire"", of 1923. Coös is an invented county in the north of New Hampshire. The inspiration for the poem is the characters in the tales of Edgar Poe who escape their incarceration or the confines of their coffins; it is a macabre ghost story. The narrator initially stresses the truth of the supernatural events he is about to tell, which he says were told to him by the witch and her son. But the tone of his language suggests that he doesn't share their beliefs - he considers them superstitious.Forty years ago, they claimed, a skeleton locked in the cellar carried itself up two flights of stairs and into the attic. These bones belonged to the woman's lover, whom her late husband had killed and buried under the house. By the end all the narrator seemed to believe was the husband's name, because there was never any evidence of human bones in the house. Frost said the theme of the poem was""murder will out - he's murder trying to get out.""This treatment of women is reminiscent of some nineteenth-century literature, where the repression of women, and their restriction to the domestic sphere, force them into flights of imaginative fancy, or even madness as in Charlotte Perkins Gilman's story""The Yellow Wallpaper"". The reader is unsure. It may have been merely a ""good yarn.""A Brook in the Cityagain comes from the collection""New Hampshire"", of 1923. This time was a period of increasing industry and urbanisation, but in many ways the poem is timeless, and speaks to us even now. Robert Frost creates and contrasts images of a peaceful brook, and a hectic city. A small sewer drain of water flows through the urban city, forgotten among the tall buildings and monuments. The poet muses that there used to be farmhouses there, and the little trickle was once a strong brook. Both of these represent the rural landscape, and a simpler way of life before the area was urbanised. An apple tree which has also been lost, and in its place is a wooden house.He describes with regret that people in their greed have built over this fresh green landscape, rendering the strong force of nature weak. At night the stream still flows, but a time will come when people will forget that there ever was a brook. It will exist only on maps. The brook, like the trees, are no longer useful in this new landscape and are converted into a useful system, then covered with dirt. No one will ever know, or care, where the brook used to be; the rural landscape is being destroyed in the name of ""progress"". The poet concludes that people are so engrossed in their own selfish lives, that they are unlikely to ever understand this mistake; that the brook in the city also deserved a life. In our self interest we have forgotten the interests of nature.Much of the power of this poem is due to its imagery and personification, such as,""The farm house lingers""or the""brook that held"". We feel the force of nature even with inanimate objects. Phrases such as,""The meadow grass could be cemented down""demonstrate both hyperbole and metaphor. The grass is not literally cemented down; it is a symbol for how nature is become overcome by cities. This poem is strengthened further by a specific rhyming scheme, which stays consistent throughout the poem.Design, from""A Further Range""of 1937, also has a very formal structure. It is a sonnet using iambic pentameter, but then the final 6 lines have a separate tight and perfect rhyming structure of their own. Typically for a sonnet, it is composed of fourteen lines and develops an argument having a shift or turn in it. Of the three different types of sonnets, (Petrarchan, Shakespearean and Spenserian)Designcombines elements of both the first two. The first line,""Ifoundadimpledspider,fatandwhite.sets the rhythm and metre for the whole poem, and the first 8 lines (or ""octave"") follow this strictly. Then by rhyming the last two lines, there is a classic Shakespearean couplet (or ""heroic couplet"") within those final differently structured 6 lines.This is just a superficial analysis of the structure; it is possible to delve far deeper with more detail. But there is a reason for Frost to employ such an unforgiving structure for this poem, which becomes evident when the reader reflects on the content of the poem.It begins then, with a big white spider on a white flower, poised to eat a white moth. The narrator ponders on the idea that all three might be brought together for some ominous reason, and this leads to further questions. Why is this flower white, when it is usually blue? Why did the spider visit this particular flower? Why did the moth decide to flutter by at that specific moment? The poet concludes that if it is ""design"" that brought these three together, it must be a very dark design. Why would God want this moth to get eaten? And in the last line he concludes that we do not know whether there is a designer, or whether everything in life is occurs in a random fashion.It is typical of Robert Frost to notice a simple fact, a small detail in nature, and mull over it at length, so that he will question the very nature of creation, and begin to consider the basic questions we all want answered about life.But is Frost laughing up his sleeve at the reader here? First of all it seemed a deceptively simple poem about a spider, then rapidly became reflections about whether there is an intelligent design behind things, and in the end the reader becomes aware of the controlled, intelligent and contrived design behind the very structure of the poem. Frost is the master of everything that he creates in this poem, down to each individual syllable.House Fearfrom""Mountain Interval""of 1916, describes the caution or concern the narrator feels about what he might find entering a dark house at night. He describes the little rituals he has, such as always making a noise, or always leaving the door open until the house was lit. Is he being fearful and cowardly instead of adventurous and brave, or simply being responsible in the face of the unknown? Does it in fact indicate a loss of adventurous spirit? These fears are common to all of us to a degree, so perhaps this is rooted in an actual fear of Robert Frosts's.The Lockless Dooris such a similar poem in both feeling and thematically, to the preceding one, that it is tempting to consider them as a a pair. Actually, however, it is from the""New Hampshire""collection of 1923.The poem is said to be based on an autobiographical event. Frost was extremely afraid of the dark as a child, to the point where he slept on a bed in his mother’s room through his high school years. In 1895, Frost was staying alone in a cottage on Ossipee Mountain when he heard a knock on the old, lockless door. Being too terrified to answer the door he jumped through a window in the back and only then calling out ""Come in!"" Next morning, Frost returned to the cottage to find one of his neighbours drunk and asleep on the floor.The poemThe Lockless Doorfollows the action of the memory, but makes it less humorous than the original episode must have seemed in retrospect. In the poem, he creates a more ominous force outside the lockless door. He says""whatever""rather than""whoever""to emphasise the potential threat, and exaggerate the narrator's own fear of the unknown. Frost uses short, stilted lines, placing the stress on the final syllable of each statement to highlight the narrator's terror.In the final stanza, Frost is gently mocking the terrified narrator - and therefore his earlier self. He points out the irony, that one simple knock causes the narrator to leave a safe refuge and expose himself to the New England winter. He also points out that this is the first chance the narrator has had to escape his isolation, and to meet another person for a long time. Rather than communicating with another person, even in an enclosed ""cage"", he still chooses to abandon it.Yet in his panicky attempt to escape the person at his door, the narrator is in the end forced to interact with the rest of the world, inevitably escaping his own enforced isolation. He feels he cannot reenter his house without knowing who is in there, so the narrator finally""alters with age"", adapting and meeting others.Again, this is a highly structured poem, made up of five stanzas of four lines each. Each line is very short, with only two feet per line and only one to three syllables per foot. This tight metre increases the sense of panic in the poem.Storm Fearis the only one of these thirteen poems from Robert Frost's very first collection,""A Boy's Will"", published in 1913 in England, or 1915 in the USA.The poem paints a grim picture of a blizzard, portraying it as a raging beast that dares the inhabitants of an isolated house to come outside and be killed. Wind and snow are hitting a basement window, but when the speaker taunts the storm it responds and gets angry.At this point it is clear that the storm may be a metaphor, or at any rate the meaning goes beyond the literal of being stuck in a storm. Frost uses many literary devices such as imagery and personification, to get his points across. Early on in the poem, the narrator counts the people, saying there are two adults and a child. Thus the poet is using this example to say that in a difficult situation we must first take control and see what our strengths are. The poem shows how people make a determined struggle to save themselves when everything else is falling apart, ending,""And my heart owns a doubtWhether 'tis in us to arise with dayAnd save ourselves unaided""Snowis another long narrative poem from his""Mountain Interval""collection of 1916, and weaves a story around one of Robert Frost's favourite themes.Out of this collection spanning many moods and periods, my personal favourites areThe Road Not Taken, Fire and Ice, A Brook in the CityandDesign.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12204.The_Road_Not_Taken_and_Other_Poems,The Road Not Taken and Other Poems.txt
Letters of John Keats,"A famous poet’s gravestone reads:Here lies one whose name was writ in water.That water must have been pretty damn cold, for the name remains writ and will do so till the end of time.John Keats, that many splendored thing.To really appreciate this poet a reading of his letters is I think essential. This is where you get the full picture of the man, with his hopes and his fears and his dreams and his doubts and his triumphs and presumptions and visions and observations and his courage and his loves and his bigotries and his loyalties and his humour and his sadness and his genius and his poor consumptive lungs. (I wonder that people had the courage to step out of their homes to buy bread and see people in those days.)So little and yet so much happens in the 242 letters that document the last three years of Keats’ life—jottings of a mind maturing day after day, week after week, right up to the end. What does Keats do during this time? Let's see: he spends a Summer in Dorset where it rains. His poem Endymion gets blasted by an army of nonentities. He goes to his brother George’s wedding and enjoys himself. He sees George and Georgiana off at Liverpool whence they'll embark on a journey to the New World, never to return. He goes on a walking tour through the North of England and Scotland for two months with his friend Brown. He visits Fingal’s cave, climbs Ben Nevis, admires bonnie Highland lasses. He come back to London to look after his sick brother Thomas, who dies in his arms. He hangs out with his friends. Writes lots of letters. Falls in love with Fanny Brawne. Gets sick. Dies.But the poems he wrote. Goddamn.Reading these letters is like watching a time-lapse film of delicate buds opening under the sunbeam of an early Spring. I believe no mind ever bloomed more beautifully. The style of the letters is slapdash, spontaneous, quick as thought, messy, funny, sublime—full of long dashes, bad spelling, slips of the pen and awful puns. Chaotic as the forest floor they are. They’re the rich and potent soil out of which the poems grew.Do yourselves a favour: set aside an hour each day to read one or two poems along with one or two letters, devote a month of your life to John Keats, the man and his work, keep at it every day without fail, prostrate yourselves at the feet of poesy, be willing to appear more than a little ridiculous as you quaff nectar with the gods. When you’re done put the books back in a dry place, take a deep breath, and get on with your lives.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/138139.Letters_of_John_Keats,Letters of John Keats.txt
Speak to Me:,"The book Speak to Me (And I Will Listen Between the Lines) by Karen English and pictures by Amy June Bates is a compilation of short poems following a group of children throughout a day of school. Personally, I really enjoyed this book and found it interesting and captivating throughout the duration. The story was following six different children, all of African American culture, and they all have their own voice and personality shown through, which added unique perspectives to the read. I enjoyed how the book went chronically throughout how a normal day of school would be. It made me think back to my elementary school days and it brought back memories that I haven't thought of in a long time, which made it fun for me. The difference between students and their specific poems was cool because the difference it showed made me think back to how I was as a student and how different people I grew up with were, this poetry book allowed you to make it personal. Although this wasn't a poetry book based on rhymes or rhythm, the poems still captivated me and did not bore me.The purpose behind this book could span to many different aspects of classroom environments. With the range of poems, you could use this book when explaining classroom rules (with the poem My Spot [Lamont] and No Saving Seats [Brianna]) or explaining the history of ones culture (I Came From The Ones Who Lived [Lamont]). The range of poems make this book a good leeway into numerous different topics within a classroom, and an age range between Kindergarten through Third Grade could find useful poems in this book. This story stems from african american students going to an inner city school, so it is full of diverse perspectives and each poem has different literary elements such as repetition and smilies and metaphors within almost each poem. The language is informal and casual considering these poems are in the minds of young students, making them relatable and relaxed for students to read which is more useful for children of a young age.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/907454.Speak_to_Me,Speak to Me.txt
"Honey, I Love and Other Love Poems","Greenfield was born Eloise Little in Parmele, North Carolina, and grew up in Washington, D.C., during the Great Depression in the Langston Terrace housing project, which provided a warm childhood experience for her.[1] She was the second oldest of five children of Weston W. Little and his wife Lessie Blanche (née Jones) Little (1906–1986). A shy and studious child, she loved music and took piano lessons.[2][3] Greenfield experienced racism first-hand in the segregated southern U.S., especially when she visited her grandparents in North Carolina and Virginia.[4] She graduated from Cardozo Senior High School in 1946 and attended Miner Teachers College until 1949. In her third year, however, she found that she was too shy to be a teacher and dropped out.[5]Greenfield began work in the civil service at the U.S. Patent Office. In 1950, she married World War II veteran Robert J. Greenfield, a long-time friend. She began writing poetry and songs in the 1950s while working at the Patent Office, finally succeeding in getting her first poem published in the Hartford Times in 1962 after many years of writing and submitting poetry and stories.[6] After joining the District of Columbia Black Writers Workshop in 1971, she began to write books for children. She has published more than 40 children's books, including picture books, novels, poetry and biographies. She says that she seeks to ""choose and order words that children will celebrate"".[5][7]Dismayed by the depiction of blacks and black communities in popular media, Greenfield has focused her work on realistic but positive portrayals of African-American communities, families and friendships.[1] These relationships are emphasized in Sister (1974) a young girl copes with the death of a parent with the help of other family members, Me and Nessie (1975) about best friends, My Daddy and I (1991) and Big Friend, Little Friend (1991) about mentoring.[5] Her first book, Bubbles (1972), ""sets the tone for much of Greenfield's later work: Realistic portrayals of loving African American parents working hard to provide for their families, and the children who face life's challenges with a positive outlook.""[1] In She Come Bringing Me that Little Baby Girl (1974), a boy deals with feelings of envy and learns to share his parents' love when his baby sister arrives. The poignant Alesia (1981) concerns the bravery of a girl handicapped by a childhood accident. Night on Neighborhood Street (1991) is a collection of poems depicting everyday life in an urban community.

Her semi-autobiographical book Childtimes: A Three-Generation Memoir (1979) describes her happy childhood in a neighborhood with strong positive relationships.[5] In the introduction to that book, she explains her interest in biography:People are a part of their time. They are affected, during the time that they live by the things that happen in their world. Big things and small things. A war, an invention such as radio or television, a birthday party, a kiss.

Poetry for Kids: Robert Frost,"Poetry for Kids: Robert Frostis the latest in a Poetry for Kids series, with previous books featuring poetry by Emily Dickinson, Carl Sandburg and Walt Whitman. This book contains 30 of Frost's poems, prefaced by an introduction of Frost's life and inspiration for his poetry, and followed by short explanations of each poem's meaning in a section titled 'What Robert Was Thinking'. There are definitions included with each poem for words children (and adults) may not be familiar with.This book is part of an established series so obviously there must be a children's market for this type of book but personally I would have preferred to see this book marketed as a gift book. Without the 'for Kids' branding I think the market would have opened right up for this book.The audience for this book is listed as 8+ but I know I wouldn't have appreciated this book as a child. At 8 I was reading Roald Dahl, not poetry books, and I don't think that's so unusual.My fear for this book is that it may be used in schools to teach poetry at kids instead of to kids, and that could ruin Robert Frost for them. I say this because the only poetry I've ever hated with a passion have been poems taught to me. I always baulked at a teacher telling me emphatically what the poet meant by each word, line by line. I wanted to have the opportunity to think about the poem myself and decide what it meant to me, and always wondered if the poet actually intended the poem to be interpreted the way my teacher said was the only way, the right way.Digressing, that reminds me of a story about Alfred Hitchcock helping his granddaughter write an essay for film school about his movieShadow of a Doubt. Her grade? C. So the story goes, he shrugged and said, ""That's the best I can do"".Anyway ... I grew up adoringThe Road Not Takenbut that was mostly because my Nan used to quote it all of the time and I'd often read the photocopied poem stuck to a wall in her house with Blu-Tack. I don't know I would have liked it as a kid without my Nan's influence.Michael Paraskevas' illustrations are absolutely wonderful! They complement the poetry beautifully. I think adults will like them better than kids though. It's only as an adult that I appreciate artwork like this.I received an ARC from NetGalley (thank you so much to NetGalley and Quarto Publishing Group - MoonDance Press for the opportunity) in exchange for honest feedback.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34220790-poetry-for-kids,Poetry for Kids Robert Frost.txt
The Waldorf Book of Poetry:  Discover the Power of Imagination,"Dave is a guidebook writer/publisher turned novelist. He began rock climbing around 1984, which was a “logical” extension of hiking, camping and backpacking since boyhood. After his first article on climbing in San Diego’s back-country was published in Rock & Ice magazine, he created the San Diego County Climbing Guide, which proved extremely popular. Next came San Diego Adventures: Classic hiking, mountain biking and rock climbing. In 2007 he completed and published a second edition of the climbing guide, which vividly detailed over 2,000 routes.Subsequently, he embarked on a fiction-writing odyssey, producing sci-fi novels and short stories “rather unsuccessfully” in terms of publication. He finally found his proper voice in 2017 when he wrote Ricochet, an intense modern-day thriller about a young female vigilante. Upon its completion, he learned about Acorn Publishing while attending the 2018 Southern California Writers’ Conference and was signed by them shortly thereafter.David is also an accomplished horticulturist. He became interested in tropical plants called Bromeliads in 2010, which quickly turned into a passion. He is an active member of the San Diego Bromeliad Society, and has won “Best of Show” awards in their annual show multiple times. His Tillandsia collection is considered one of the best in the region. For many years he and his wife Debbie have been chief volunteer caretakers of the San Diego Zoo’s Kent Bromeliad Garden.Becoming a novelist is the realization of a lifelong dream. David loves the process of storytelling, of waking up each day well before dawn and diving into the art of making words come together in a way that appeals.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12780791-the-waldorf-book-of-poetry,The Waldorf Book of Poetry  Discover the Power of Imagination.txt
A Child's Book of Poems,"During the last part of Ambleside Online Year 1, the poetry book called for was to choose from either A Child's Book of Poems or the Oxford Book of Poetry for Children. I chose A Child's Book of Poems primarily because it was simpler to find. The book itself is a quite lovely hardcover with lovely black and white and color illustrations. Here's what the children thought:Ellie (age 6): Five stars! I loved it!Connor (age 7): Four stars! It was pretty good. I liked the poems. (He had me put it on the bookshelf so that he could pull it out to read some of the poems again, and I thought that was a pretty good endorsement.)Emalee (age 11): One star. I only liked one poem, ""The Fleas and the Fly."" (This is the third poetry book in a row she's given one or two stars too. I'm beginning to think that she just doesn't like poetry. I think I should try a story in verse, like ""Brown Girl Dreaming"" to see if she would like that better.)Bennett (age 12): Four stars! I really like some of the poems. Others are way too short.As far as my thoughts go, this is a varied and wide ranging volume, and there are poems in here that every child and adult will like. Some of the poems are familiar, and others may be new, but they are all quality poems. They range from famous poems by authors names that I'm not as familiar with to poems by Dickinson, Tennyson, and Longfellow. The lovely illustrations make it a pleasure to read to children.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2643857-a-child-s-book-of-poems,A Child's Book of Poems.txt

Tyrannosaurus Was a Beast: Dinosaur Poems,"This will be the perfect book for my brother to read to his two-and-one-half year old daughter, who loves dinosaurs so much that she can already correctly identify her toy dinosaurs as T-Rex, Triceratops, etc. The book features one-page poems about fourteen different dinosaurs, with bright illustrations of the dinosaur on the facing page. There are some dinosaurs that I've never even heard of, like the Queztalcoatlus (which looks like a Pterodactyl to me).Jack Prelutsky's poetry is rhythmic, funny and informative. Much likeThe Dragons Are Singing Tonight- my personal favorite - the poems inTyrannosaurus Was a Beast: Dinosaur Poemsare full of advanced vocabulary words that perfectly flow with the verse. There are so many great laugh out loud lines in the poems that it is difficult to decide which poem is my favorite. The only thing that could have made the book better was if had been another collaboration with illustratorPeter Sís. WhileArnold Lobel's illustrations are beautiful, they lack the humor and style thatPeter Sísbrings to the table. The best illustration of the book is the cover, where the Tyrannosaurus seems to have a personality - a big smile and bright trickster eyes.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2027823.Tyrannosaurus_Was_a_Beast,Tyrannosaurus Was a Beast Dinosaur Poems.txt

Dreamers,"Work in the children’s book business long enough and you run the risk of harboring grudges. Or, to be more specific, grudges o’ love. Grudges on behalf of the hardworking authors and illustrators that never seem to get their adequate due. There are whole lists of talented people out there that somehow don’t appeal to award committees, year after year, in spite of their supreme talents. That’s why it makes me so happy when things begin to change. Yuyi Morales may be a name new to you, but I’d been following her career closely over the years. Her remarkable model work on her Caldecott Honor winning bookViva Fridawas preceded five years earlier by the unjustly ignored model work she did on Tony Johnston’sMy Abuelita. And for all that the Boston Globe-Horn Book Honor given toThunder Boy Jr.celebrated her unique ability to enclose and encircle and gather together, where was the wide acclaim for her earlier Mexican wrestler delightNino Wrestles the World? So you can imagine my happiness when I sawDreamersfor the first time. Not since Jerry Pinkney’sLion and the Mousehave I had such a palpable sense of a long-term artist finally getting their due. Now, at long last, the world will know better the name “Yuyi Morales”. And keep knowing it too, if I don’t miss my guess.On the title page, a girl sleeps on a desk, a pencil fallen from her hand and drawings scribbled beneath her. Turn the page and now that same hand is holding a pencil, but it is adult now. It has written “Amor – Love – Amor.” above the image of a mother and child falling towards one another. The text reads, “I dreamed of you, then you appeared.” The child is tiny and the two travel across a bridge to a place full of fog and bats and words that cannot be understood. Unable to connect, the two learn, make mistakes, and just walk endlessly until they reach “a place we had never seen before.” The books there are for the taking and it is “Where we didn’t need to speak, we only needed to trust.” And with trust comes knowledge. And with knowledge comes creativity and art and the ability to find your own voice. And the hand that at the start wrote “Amor – Love – Amor” writes “Love Amor Love” at the end. A personal note from the author and an extensive Bibliography of “Books That Inspired Me (and Still Do)” bring everything to a close.Okay. Quiz time. Books closed, people. And no Googling when I finish my question, okay? Ahem. Please name me three picture book memoirs, written by their subjects. Go. A tricky proposition, is it not? The memoir, by its very definition, unless written by a child is going to be about an adult remembering either a specific moment in their life or a moment in their childhood. I’ve seen a wide range of them over the years too. On the more fantastical side you’d get books like William Joyce’sBilly’s Booger: A Memoir, which look at childhood memories. On the opposite side of the spectrum there’s Michael Rosen’s gut-wrenchingThe Sad Bookabout the death of his son and the aftermath of grief. Jacqueline Woodson takes a broader view, chronicling her family, but always including herself, in books likeShow WayandThis Is the Rope. Yuyi’s book is interesting because of the books mentioned here,Dreamersactually bears more in common withThe Sad Bookthan any other. But where Rosen’s story is about how the relationship between a father and son is cut short, Yuyi’s is about how a son’s life is poised on the outset to begin, and how she soars right alongside him. To pair the two together is to pair life with death, grief and hope. And it speaks to the depth and breath of picture book memoirs, for clearly there are as many ways to write them as there are pages in a tree.Which leads, in its oh so natural way, to the question that invariably comes up when folks start talking about picture book memoirs: Is this really a book for children? It’s not a ridiculous question, but it does speak to a lot of assumptions people have when they discuss literature for small children. There is an unspoken understanding that unless the hero of your book is small and has either feathers or fur, they cannot be both adult and the story’s protagonist. Never mind anything else. Adult humans bereft of magic are not considered sufficient heroes in young children’s stories. Not unless there’s something goofy about them, like they grow balloons out of the ground, are whimsical, or have magic powers. Now in the case ofDreamersthe question is fraught because while this is a memoir it is also a celebration of both mother and child. In this way, it at times feels like it would fit in with the baby shower books. You couldn’t take a dart and throw it in a bookstore without hitting a picture book about a parent celebrating the birth of their child somewhere in the stacks. These books are invariably given at baby showers, ostensibly to the child when really it’s for the parent. IsDreamerssuch a book? Some might think so. Others, however, would dig a little deeper and examine precisely what’s going on here. Because here’s the secret of the whole endeavor: Any picture book is for children if the adult reader has a clue about how to tackle it. And just because the adult is telling the story, that doesn't mean kids aren't going to be able to parse together what they say.Here’s one method for engaging child readers: Let them decipher each picture. There’s a method of teaching picture books called The Whole Book Method (founded by Megan Dowd Lambert, developed in association with the Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art) that, simply put, forgoes the idea of reading “to” children and engages by reading “with” children. Books likeDreamersare perfect for this method of reading collaboration. What’s nice is that Yuyi has put all the clues there before you. For example, notice how the English words when the mother and child first arrive appear as backwards letters in the clouds. I’m reminded of the words in Shaun Tan’s own immigration book,The Arrival. Like Yuyi, he sought to make the words in the book simultaneously familiar and unfamiliar, so he would cut them up and rearrange them in unfamiliar patterns. No fool, she pays homage to him, includingThe Arrivalin her book on the page where it reads “and to make our voices heard.” But there are other details that reward rereadings as well. Early in the book, Yuyi writes, “Once day we bundled gifts in our backpack.” Inside we see the neck of a guitar, a raining cloud, a sun, a moon, a star, a flower, a skeleton coiffing its hair, a howling animal, a beaded heart, a volcano, a leaf, a pencil, and a bird. That backpack remains on the mother’s back for the whole of the book until the moment the librarian offers a library card. Then, and only then, the “gifts” burst out of the backpack, though it is interesting to note that while the mother offers her baby to the card, she keeps at least one foot rooted in her gifts. After that, the gifts fly about the both of them, replaced in the backpack by books. Finally, there are aspects to the art that defy normal conventions and invite the most interesting of speculations. You, the adult reader, could build whole discussions with your kids regarding the mother’s skirt in this book. Is it even a skirt? Is it feathers? Is it fire? Why does it reach up when it could reach down? Is there a significance to that?Under normal circumstances, when I want to find out how the art in a picture book was created, I turn to the publication page. There, in words almost too tiny to make out with the naked eye, the publisher will sometimes answer the curious reader’s questions. You can read how the book was done in watercolors or on a computer. Sometimes, if they’re feeling particularly inventive, they'll say how the art was constructed with raw cotton, or photographed glass, or fire! In this book, Yuyi Morales includes an explanation of the art that I would write here but cannot because I haven’t the space. She begins with the usual suspects. The acrylics on paper with ink (“and a nib pen that once belonged to Maurice Sendak”). But much of the art here consists of photographed images of textures and papers and fabrics that carry special meaning for Ms. Morales. Kelly’s childhood drawings. The floor of her studio. Walls from the streets of her hometown. By the end of reading this, the Bibliography, and the Author’s Note at the back, you are perfectly aware of what a personal book this is to its creator. And like any good memoir, only by making the book as specific and personal as possible is Ms. Morales capable of tapping into the truly universal.Yuyi Morales is hardly the first person to pay tribute to other children’s book writers and illustrators by including images of their jackets in a book, but she may be the first I’ve seen to do so many and NOT fall back on the usual suspects. Usually, when this is done, it is rote.Cat and the Hatnext toIf You Give a Mouse a Cookienext toThe Very Hungry Caterpillar, or what have you. The very first thing I noticed in this book was that the titles were (A) Clearly beloved favorites but NOT overly familiar and (B) All from a very specific publication period.A Mother for Chocoby Keiko Kasza was my first tipoff that this book wasn’t going in the usual directions. Looking closer at her choices I saw a wide array of publication dates, a special attention paid to creators of all backgrounds, and even the occasional adult title (Woman Hollering Creekby Sandra Cisneros) slipped in on the sly. And not just book covers either. Repeated inspections of the pages reveal title after title after title, accurate right down the spine, the font, and the colors of the jackets themselves.I just stopped myself from launching into a whole paragraph about the possible Christian imagery you could find in the book if you really wanted to, but let’s sideline that discussion for another day, shall we? The fact of the matter is thatDreamersis the best kind of picture book because it makes you want to think and discuss and think some more and get opinions from other people, and still think. It opens up discussions, not just about the ideas I’ve listed here, but about immigration, loneliness, the Dreamers and undocumented. Yuyi Morales writes in the back of this book, “All of us have stories. Each of them is different.” And then at the end, “Now I have told you my story. What’s yours?” I think the better parts of our lives are spent in trying to figure out what we want to dream at all. Books like this one help. They help kids. They help parents. They help everyone. A clear-cut example of the rarest kind of best we hope for when we read a book to our children. You couldn’t ask for better.For ages 5 and up.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39651067-dreamers,Dreamers.txt

Selected Poems,"""There was no doubt that this poor man was mad, but there is something in the madness of this man which interests me more than the sanity of Lord Byron and Walter Scott.""- Wordsworth on William BlakeWhile it may have worked for Wordsworth, Blake’s madness doesn’t do much for me. Maybe we’re overused to it now.Reputation – 4/5William Blake spent his life working as an engraver of other people’s books. In his own time and with his own money he published small editions of his own poetry with original illustrations. None of it made any impression on anyone and he was practically unknown when he died in 1827. Two generations of Romantic poets glossed over him; Wordsworth’s above comment being the only mention made of him by any of the great Romantics.But by the middle of the 20th Century, Blake had become the most widely studied and interpreted poet in English. Poets, hippies, and academics alike praised his work and searched for meaning in it. What had happened?Point – 2/5Blake had become a prophet.Taking his poetry and visual art together, a century of over-interpreters had found a new puzzle in William Blake. His cryptic metaphors, his sustained darkness and pessimism, and the strangeness of his engravings gave the impression that, cloaked under the madness, there was a structured cosmology invented by an original genius.There can be no doubt that Blake was an original. His visual art, though crude and childlike when compared with professionally trained artists of any period, does create a strong impression. When seen side-by-side with his poetry, the cumulative weirdness of both does make one feel that there issomethingbelow the surface. When seen in this light, it’s really no surprise that Blake became very popular among people like Allen Ginsberg and Jim Morrison, who must have spent many drugged nights repeating the kind of mysterious phrases that are the backbone of Blake’s poetry:”To see a World in a Grain of SandAnd a Heaven in a Wild FlowerHold Infinity in the palm of your handAnd Eternity in an hour”“The Lamb misused breeds Public StrifeAnd yet forgives the Butchers Knife.””He who shall hurt the little wren shall never be beloved by men.”“No bird soars too high. if he soars with his own wings.”These are admittedly fascinating. They shamelessly beg interpretation. And that is at once their success and failure.The only way to consider Blake a great writer is to consider him a prophet, to take phrases like the above and to try to make sense of them. Blake’s works of “prophecy” are laden with aphorisms that, out of context, sound pregnant with meaning. But when they are actually read one after another in the shape of a poem, they are just a string of empty phrases, unconnected with one another by any comprehensible logic. After 11 other senseless phrases that don’t sound as good, you come across a 12th like the ones quoted above – terse, dazzling, and strange.Works like “The Auguries of Innocence” are collections of these rambling prophecies, ongoing assemblages of hit or miss proverbs. This is the basis of Blake’s poetics.What Blake truly lacks is sustained concentration and attention. This is not surprising in a person who is called mad even by his most fervent admirers. Wordsworth was absolutely right: Blake was a madman. And not merely a madman, but one tending to the darker side of life. To Blake, everything is:“weeping” – appears 36 times in the 80 or so pages of text,“tears” - 34 times,“crying” - 30 times,“dark” - 29 times,“woe” - 20 times,“pride” - 18 times,“pitiful” - 16 times,“sorrow” - 15 times,“Satan” - 12 times, or“lion” - 16 times.That Blake was a tortured crazy man, there can be no question. To call him a tortured genius really says much more about the age interpreting him than about Blake himself.Now, we are simply living in an age in which we are more interested in madness than in sanity. We love a good tortured soul, and we love trying to figure out what they were trying to say.Recommendation – 4/5If you love the persecuted, lonely artist, struggling against poverty and society to express his wild vision, then let me tell you, you are going to LOVE William Blake. He’s the archetypal madman artist and poet. The only other crazy person that comes close is Van Gogh, and even he was monotonously normal compared to Blake. If you like poetry because you like to get stoned and read it in the middle of the night with a few candles lit while spacey music plays in the background, then Blake is your man. If you’re a graduate student in literature who wants to find a subject to talk about that no one will understand, here, take this book. Hell, this book isn’t crazy enough, go take Blake’sJerusalemoff the shelves and see what you can find in there.I may sound like I’m being facetious, but the three types I have described above make up a large proportion of the people that read poetry for pleasure. So, 4/5.Enjoyment – 2/5For me, though – 2/5.Blake’s craziness doesn’t do it for me. To sit there pouring over clumsy phrases like“Tools were made & Born were handsEvery Farmer understands.”No thank you. When Blake is understandable his language is awkward, when he is cryptic, he is occasionally beautiful, but always crazy. To my mind there are much more profound and universal things to try to interpret than the scribblings of an amateur poet living in England in the late 18th Century. If I were interested in that sort of obsessiveness, I would choose a wider and more worthwhile mind. Joyce’s, for example.There are endless interpretations of Blake. But to me he seems like a bit of a con man on top of being a madman. His fight against the Reason of Newton and Voltaire is noble in the sense of the Romantic, but in Blake it ends in the tyranny of impenetrable and incomplete individual mythologies that are too devoid of reason to offer a key to them. But by making himself out to be a declared enemy of Reason, Blake is begging to be interpreted on his own terms. Clever bait. And one that our academics never get tired of taking.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/412070.Selected_Poems,Selected Poems.txt
Heartbeat,"""Am I supposed to do somethingimportant?It doesn't seem enoughto merely take up spaceon this planetin this countryin this statein this townin this family.""―Annie,Heartbeat, P. 28All of life comes down to the heartbeat, doesn't it? For the very old and the newborn babe, the extravagantly wealthy and the dirt poor, the deliriously happy and those in the midst of despair, the heartbeat is the sign that life goes on, that the body is functional and still capable of keeping itself going even if nothing seems right in one's world. For Annie, the heartbeat can be felt in the pulsing rhythm of running barefoot, an instinctive pastime for her that reaffirms with each pounding footfall the life that courses within her body, the hope and joy and expectation for her future as it grows and branches out in so many surprising ways. After waiting so long for the birth of her new baby brother or sister, an impossibly fragile new life form that will enter this world as every other child before it has done, on a whisper and a hope that all will go as planned and the baby will pass from the darkness of the womb into the brightness of the world with all the fullness of life pumping through its veins, Annie experiences the gift of connectedness that a healthy heartbeat can be in whatever form one's awareness of it takes, a promise of the presence of life and the potential of that life for as long as the heartbeat continues.Though a runner by nature, Annie has no visions of stardom on the track, no thoughts of blazing along at top speed alongside other gifted runners in hopes of crossing the finish line just before them. Running is a lot more visceral than that to Annie, a personal venture of movement and athletic consistency that reaches beyond the acclaim available from outside watchers and touches the core of her spirit. Running is aboutrunningfor Annie; it's not about winning or competing or setting goals or proving anything, it's aboutrunning. Annie and her friend Max go running by themselves all the time, with no words necessary at the start, finish or along the way, just the rhythmic cadence of their breathing in time and the shared focus of getting somewhere, not always even certain where that is when they first take off on a run. Max isn't sure that the quiet synchronicity of running along with Annie is all that he wants anymore, though. He wants to join the track team at school, and he'd like Annie to join with him.Annie's grandfather was once a good runner, a genuine track star, and it seems to her that he was never happier than when he stepped away from the track and decided that he'd had enough of competition. Annie feels sure that running is all she needs, even as Max continues to urge her to consider joining the team. The girl's track coach also takes the time to tell Annie that she thinks she has real talent as a runner, and it would be a shame to let that talent go to waste by not finding out what she might be capable of doing as part of a team. Still, nothing has changed for Annie. All she wants from running is to run, and her single-mindedness begins to put some strain on her friendship with Max.""And what did I thinkwhen I was smalland why did I forget?And what else will I forgetwhen I grow older?And if you forgetis it as ifit never happened?Will none of the thingsyou saw or thought or dreamedmatter?""―Annie, PP. 43-44While Annie rebuffs the attempts of the track coach to get her on the team, expectations at home start to grow with the exciting news that Annie's mother will be having a baby. Even as the weeks and then months pass and the baby grows larger inside of Annie's mother, though, her grandfather shows signs that he is at the other end of the life cycle. He has a hard time remembering things, and his reactions to simple parts of everyday life can be unexpected and disconcerting. The track star he once was has undeniably faded, and Annie isn't sure what to think about her grandfather's inevitable continued decline. She remembers the wise, funny person he once was, on top of things physically and mentally, and it's hard to see him losing, a little bit at a time, those qualities that had made him so special.Of all the experiences she has during the nine months in which her mother is pregnant, it's the assignment at school of drawing an apple once a day for a hundred days that teaches Annie the most. As the apple undergoes physical changes and spots appear on its skin, the outside grows softer and changes color, and eventually a certain someone from her family takes an unapproved bite out of it, Annie has time to reflect on the nature of the apple, filled with seeds that all hold the potential to grow into apple trees of their own. One might not be sure how many of the seeds would really ever spring up into a tree, or what the tree would grow to look like or how long it might live or how its apples would taste, but all the basic elements of that possible future tree are right there in those seeds inside of the apple. Annie perceives that a baby human is just like that; we can't be sure how it will grow or if it's going to be healthy or how its personality will develop or a thousand different things that matter to us and we really want to know as we await its arrival and then observe it as a newborn, but those are seeds that won't blossom until their time has come. Like the apple, we can watch and wait to see who the baby will become and marvel at how something which at one time was nothing but a miniscule cluster of cells could grow to be a living, breathing, unique human being, a fully functional child complete with its own heartbeat that reminds us of the similarities of every living creature, and what a miracle it is every time one enters the world.Does Annie have much to learn as we readHeartbeat? Yes, I suppose she does, but no more than any other person in the world. As I see it, most of what she learns flows from the contemplative, rhythmic way she observes the life built around her, her personal thoughts providing far better insight into it than any outside interpreter could have given. Annie views her world with fresh eyes every day, willing to see anew the people in it and their situations and understand better how everything fits together. Annie is a very (I know I shouldn't be using that word, it's on the forbidden list!) natural person, content to live within her own expectations and not rely on others for affirmation. On page fourteen, she acknowledges that people might think she and Max are crazy for running barefoot all the time, even in the mud and rain and snow, ""but it doesn't feel crazy to us. It feels like what we do"". What simpler explanation could exist for why one does something, than that it's just what one does? Annie takes this thought process in all matters, especially in regard to her desire to continue running apart from any formal practice squad or school team. If she had wanted to be part of the team then she would have tried out for it, so she clearly doesn't want to be part of it. That's enough for her and she expects it to be enough for others, even as Max continues to be perplexed by Annie's decision to remain a solo runner.I love how deeply Annie invests herself in the school assignment of describing what she loves and what she fears. When she hears the other kids talking about the assignment, she realizes that all of them have chosen superficial things to ""love"", such as candy and television and weekends. What does Annie think about this? ""Ilikethese things but I do notlovethem and I wonder if I amsupposedto love them and I wonder if I have done the assignment wrong"". Annie wonders if perhaps she took the project too seriously, if her teacher really only wanted to hear about superficial likes, but I'm of the mind that Annie's thoughtfulness about what she truly loves is much more what her teacher was hoping to get out of the assignment from her students. The ""fears"" side of the project runs along the same lines, as Annie's classmates choose things like tests and reports, while Annie delves deep to honestly express:""I am afraid of dyingand of my family dyingof disappearingand not knowingthat you have disappearedor being left alonewith no one to love you.""While all of Annie's classmates may share her fears, Annie is the one with the courage to write them down and the emotional honesty to express them, to name her fears even when she would rather not think about them. This honesty, I think, is why we love being inside her head, experiencing the story from her unique perspective as we come to know her as a friend. It's because we're coming to know her so well, then, that we understand the rhythms of her speech and what she means to say when she describes her feelings in ways that might not make sense to most other people. After drawing the apple for many, many weeks, taking care to keep it in as good of condition as possible even as all of the other kids have had to replace their original apples with new ones, Annie realizes that drawing the exact same apple for a hundred days straight doesn't become easier with familiarity; the task grows more difficult, because even though it's the same apple it is always changing, developing new flecks and spots and nuances of color that it didn't have at first. The apple continues to change even as it grows soft and begins to decay, and that's part of what makes the project interesting. Trying to describe what it's like, Annie thinks: ""When I was running today and thinking about the apple I felt as if I was full of that apple and Iknewthe apple"". Annie admits that the thought sounds peculiar, but I think I get what she means. Though most people may never form quite that kind of attachment to an apple, when one deeply ponders something or someone for a long while, becoming more familiar with that thing or person by memory, it feels as if something special has occurred, a rare connection made that only makes sense internally. When one's mind continually drifts to that thing or person and just resting on them for a little while provokes a smile, that's a nice place to be. Even if it doesn't last for very long, and eventually one no longer has that level of familiarity with the thing or person, it really is nice while it lasts.As Annie nears the end of her apple project and the due date for the birth of her baby sibling draws near, what happens down the stretch will continue to shape the way she views the world. Whether or not she ever decides to try being on a team, or the full meaning of her drawing project is appreciated by her teacher, the events of Annie's life do affect and change her in their own subtle way. The birth of a new child, though, always seems to have the biggest impact of all, and in the rush of nervous excitement and unrestrained energy as the baby begins to come and everyone hurries to prepare for the delivery, Annie sees that no matter how the birth turns out, her life will never be the same.Wonderfully, inspirationally wise, luminescently funny and always, always, always emotionally resonant, Sharon Creech has created a lead character and story inHeartbeatthat easily could have brought her another Newbery Honor. She is a fabulous author, more consistent than all but a select few and capable of the most extraordinary mixtures of profoundly compelling emotion and fresh comedic energy. I certainly recommendHeartbeatto anyone who has loved the writing of Sharon Creech, is partial to novels in verse or simply appreciates excellent literature. Any way one looks at it,Heartbeatis definitely a keeper.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53492.Heartbeat,Heartbeat.txt
This Is Just to Say: Poems of Apology and Forgiveness,"Poetry4-6This book succinctly demonstrates the power of poetry: simple in concept, deeply moving.Written by a fifth-grade class after studying a mentor text poem, the first half is poems by the students to someone they feel they need to apologize to. These poems are funny and heartbreaking, but the tears came for me as I read several of the poems in the second half: the responses from the recipients of the first poems.As a teaching tool, this book is powerful because it is another class doing exactly the same thing our class might be doing- studying a mentor text and writing our own works. But it was professionally published, and now is used as a mentor text itself!As a work of art, this collection of poems tell the stories of average kids with average problems and average worries to a distinctly above-average effect. As I connected each response back to the original apology poem, I became invested in the lives of both parties. Will the school secretary forgive the boy for stealing jelly donuts out of the teacher's lounge? (Yes, but she still had to call his mother.) From over-enthusiastic dodge ball incident apologies between friends to an apology from a son to his mother for being a disappointment to her and a failure for not winning a spelling bee, the poems run the gamut of emotions and experiences.And the biggest tear-jerker? The response to the spelling bee failure: it was not written by his mother, but by another student in the class, with the byline noting that the poem is by the student in place of the mother, because the mother thought this was silly and pointless. (I'm paraphrasing, but that's the idea.) The poem from a father to his daughter telling her that his leaving the family was not her fault was also an emotional experience.What an example to students of how poetry can help us deal with our own emotions and also help us communicate with other people.Text set ideas: poetry, emotional awareness",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/747252.This_Is_Just_to_Say,This Is Just to Say Poems of Apology and Forgiveness.txt

A Fairy Different Life,"A young girl looks down on her classmates until a fairy comes along and turns her world upside down. Find out what happens when the bully becomes the bullied in, ""A Fairy Different Life.""This story has been read & loved by many children (3+), parents and teachers on numerous occasions. Furthermore, it has been awarded the following five-star Readers' Favorite editorial review by Kristen Van Kampen.A Fairy Different Life by Goob is a rhyming, educational children's book that follows a young girl. The girl is a bully, and she doesn't like the way certain people dress, or how certain people act. She wished everyone would be more like her, and then a fairy appears and grants her wish. Everyone now dressed the same way and acted the same way. A few people start braiding leaves into their hair, but won't include the girl. Then the others started bullying her. She realizes that she isn't perfect, and that it isn't nice to judge others. But how will she get the world back to normal?I really enjoyed A Fairy Different Life by Goob. The book shows young readers that you shouldn't bully, and that life would be horrible if everyone was the same. The book teaches these lessons in a fun and easy to understand way. I liked how the book shows that often people don't like others because they're different. The book also shows that everyone can change for the better. The rhyming is very well done and gives the book a rhythm. The pictures by Regina Land are very well done and depict the scenes very well. The pictures are also very colourful and fun to look at. I liked how there was a pun in the title. The characters are all very relatable, because most people, at one point, have wished that someone was more like them. I would recommend A Fairy Different Life to all young readers.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29691887-a-fairy-different-life,A Fairy Different Life.txt
"Pigs Aplenty, Pigs Galore!","Pigs Aplenty, Pigs Galore! by David McPhail is a fictional story intended for children between Kindergarten and Second Grade. The story is about a man who is in his house reading a book, when his house is suddenly invaded by pigs. More and more pigs keep coming to the house and won’t leave.I really like the book because the rhymes are silly and the illustrations effectively animate the characters and the plot. The man becomes frustrated and demands that the pigs leave his house. The pigs protested, so the man said they could only stay with him if they helped clean up. The man and the pigs cleaned the house and went to bed.This book would fun for teachers to read aloud. The book would best be used for teaching phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, and comprehension. For phonemic awareness, teachers can have the students listen and pick out the rhyming words. For phonics, the teacher can have the students identify words that contain double letters such as yell and piggy. The teacher can also have the students identify words such as reading and feeding. For fluency, the teacher can model how to read with expression to show the difference between characters. For comprehension, the teacher can have the students retell the story orally in their own words.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1544662.Pigs_Aplenty_Pigs_Galore_,"Pigs Aplenty, Pigs Galore!.txt"
Llama Llama Red Pajama,"Years ago I used to work at Barnes and Noble as the Children's Lead. As such, one of my duties was to do story time on Saturday mornings. I cant tell you how many various children's books I read, and I honestly don't remember many reactions. For the most part I read a story and moved on to the next, only noting when one was an utter miss so I didn't read it again.This was the only one that had an extreme enough of a positive reaction that I recall it vividly. I pulled out the book and suddenly some 30 or so children lost their minds and I suddenly felt like a rock star on a stage… if the entire fan base was five and under.I picked it up again recently for my daughter, and it is once again repeating. We've read it five nights in a row now, and every time she gets so excited to hear it. If you have a young child in your life, make sure you give this one a try as it seems to be a consistent hit. 4/5 stars",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/401679.Llama_Llama_Red_Pajama,Llama Llama Red Pajama.txt

How the Grinch Stole Christmas!,"How is it that I did not remember that the Grinch in the book is not green? Picking up Dr. Seuss’sHow the Grinch Stole Christmasfor a holiday-time re-read, I found that that realization was what really struck me. There is green in the book, of course – the back cover and the spine are green, and Dr. Seuss’s name on the front cover is green, and there are jagged green accent marks around the picture of the Grinch on the cover. But the Grinch himself? White, with red eyes. Somehow, that changed the way I experienced the whole book.How the Grinch Stole Christmaswas originally published in 1957. In the 60-plus years since its publication, it has become a familiar part of the North American Christmastime holiday ritual – in part, no doubt, because of Chuck Jones’s 1966 television cartoon featureHow the Grinch Stole Christmas!, with Boris Karloff starring both as narrator and as a very green Grinch. The music alone influences how we look at and think of this particular Christmas story:“You’re a mean one, Mister Grinch/You really are a heel/You’re as cuddly as a cactus, you’re as charming as an eel…”Strange to reflect that that song is nowhere to be found in Dr. Seuss’s original book. Indeed, the book was making a powerful impression upon children and parents alike for the nine years when there wasonlya book: no TV adaptation, with no songs. Perhaps that happened because Dr. Seuss’s poetry has a musicality of its own.At its growing-three-sizes heart,How the Grinch Stole Christmasis a drama of reclamation, like other Christmas classics from Charles Dickens’s novellaA Christmas Carol(1843) to Frank Capra’s filmIt’s a Wonderful Life(1947). The formula for this sort of reclamation drama is a familiar one by now: a character – whether his name is Ebenezer Scrooge, or George Bailey, or The Grinch – finds himself lost in moral darkness as Christmas draws near.Against the backdrop of a society-wide celebration of a Christmas holiday that is mainly or exclusively secular (with the religious origins of the holiday alluded to only briefly, or not at all), the protagonist is eventually infused with the spirit of the season – often though not always through the intercession of one or more interlocutors who somehow embody holiday cheer – and goes forth spiritually renewed, as a better and more compassionate character.And so it is withHow the Grinch Stole Christmas. As I trust we all know by now, the Grinch is a furry humanoid creature that lives in the hills outside ofWho-ville. For reasons that are never made altogether clear – a kind of “motiveless malignity” akin to Coleridge’s description of Iago from Shakespeare’sOthello– the Grinch hates the local residents, theWhos, and particularly the way theWhoscelebrate Christmas. Determined to stop all the things he hates about Christmas – the children playing with their toys, the feasting, the singing – the Grinch determines to “stop Christmas from coming” by stealing the whole holiday, lock, stock, and tinsel, from every singleWhoinWho-ville. Spoiler alert: things do not go according to grinchy plan.Returning to this book after many years away from it, I was struck by a number of things – aside from a distressingly non-green Grinch. Most of the lines of poetry are so familiar, from repeat viewings of both the 1966 TV cartoon and the more recent film adaptations from the years 2000 and 2018, that I found myself focusing in on some of the lesser-known lines. I was struck, for example, by the way Dr. Seuss described the Grinch “Staring down from his cave with a sour, Grinchy frown/At the warm lighted windows below in their town.” The accompanying visual shows the Grinch at the mouth of his cave, grimacing down at four vaguely pumpkin-shapedWhohouses. Everything is snow-white, cold white, except for the red of the Grinch’s eyes and the red of the lighted windows in theWhos’warm houses. One feels the frozen exile of the Grinch – both the cold winter temperatures outside, and the even more bitter coldness of the Grinch’s tiny heart.Against those images of the Grinch’s bitter loneliness, his absolute isolation, it makes sense that he obsesses endlessly about the Christmas fun theWho’swill be having – a two-page spread in which he envisions the chaos ofWhochildren with tennis rackets and hockey sticks and big bass drums and toy trains and jack-in-the-boxes, under a bunting that bears the words “MERRY MERRY”; another two-page spread that shows theWhosassembling for their holiday feast at a table shaped like a giant reversed letter “S” under a huge wreath adorned with the words “MERRY MERRY”; and a final two-page spread that shows theWho’sstanding in a circle, joyfully singing. I find myself putting these images together with an oft-overlooked line from this otherwise widely-quoted and universally known text: “Why, for fifty-three years I’ve put up with it now!”“Fifty-three.” Interesting. Dr. Seuss, born in 1904, was 53 years old whenHow the Grinch Stole Christmaswas published in 1957. We all know the pressure that the Christmas holiday puts on us to be “MERRY MERRY,” regardless of the difficulties and misfortunes that may be unfolding in our lives at any given time. We are besieged with media-generated images of perfect happy families enjoying perfect merry Christmases, in a way that’s enough to remind the rest of us that we don’t achieve that sort of holiday perfection. Is that not enough to bring out the Grinch in anyone?I think it was a remarkable act of intellectual honesty on Dr. Seuss’s part to make the Grinch his own age, to identify on that level with the Grinch – to suggest, gently and subtly, that there’s a little bit of the Grinch in all of us.I was also struck by two images that one sees in one of the most crucial moments from the book – the moment when the Grinch, in his first act of Christmas thievery, is caught in the act by “Little Cindy-Lou-Who, who was not more than two”, who understandably wants to know why “Santy Claus” is taking the family Christmas tree up the chimney. As the Grinch invents his lie about fixing a broken light on the tree, he closes his red eyes; and with his red eyes closed, he looks much more benign, remarkably like the Cat in the Hat. Perhaps Dr. Seuss is making a point regarding how easy it is for all of us to practice deceit; a Grinch can, quick as a flash, seem to become a Cat in the Hat, even a Santa Claus. It is all a matter of whether the listener sees only what he or she wants to see.We know, of course, that the Grinch undergoes a change of heart. Standing with his ill-gotten gains atop Mount Crumpit, listening in hopes of hearing lamentation and weeping from the Who’s who have had all their Christmas presents stolen from them, the Grinch, “with his grinch-feet ice-cold in the snow,” finds that theWho’sare not crying, but rather singing. Christmas, he learns, “doesn’t come from a store”; his tiny heart grows three sizes. “And the minute his heart didn’t feel quite so tight,/He whizzed with his load through the bright morning light”. Gifts returned, roast beast carved, Christmas saved – all is well.Or is it? A couple of Christmas seasons ago, I was at a Hallmark store in Gainesville, Virginia, picking up some stocking stuffers. The clerk complimented me on my Christmas tie, and I expressed a hope that customers were behaving well in spite of the stress of the holiday season. “Most,” the clerk said with a weary smile. “We do get some Grinches.” Being a Grinch is a choice that is all too easy for us to make; and all of us, through a harsh word, an unkind remark, a thoughtless gesture, have stolen a little bit of someone else’s Christmas at one time or another. There is, as stated above, more than a little bit of the Grinch in all of us. Dr. Seuss, inHow the Grinch Stole Christmas, reminds us not to let our own hearts grow “two sizes too small.”",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/113946.How_the_Grinch_Stole_Christmas_,How the Grinch Stole Christmas!.txt
Milk and honey,"milk and honeyis a collection of poetry and prose about survival. About the experience of violence, abuse, love, loss, and femininity. It is split into four chapters, and each chapter serves a different purpose.It’s difficult trying to review this because every poem is extremely personal, tender and exquisite in its own way.So I decided to feature some of my favorite ones:“you tell me to quiet down causemy opinions make me less beautifulbut i was not made with a fire in my bellyso i could be put outi was not made with a lightness on my tongueso i could be easy to swallowi was made heavyhalf blade and half silkdifficult to forget and not easyfor the mind to follow”“i struggle so deeplyto understandhow someone canpour their entire soulblood and energyinto someonewithout wantinganything inreturn- i will have to wait till i’m a mother”“when my mother says i deserve betteri snap to your defense out of habithe still loves me i shoutshe looks at me with defeated eyesthe way a parent looks at their childwhen they know this is the type of paineven they can’t fixand saysit means nothing to me if he loves youif he can’t do a single wretched thing about it”“he only whispers i love youas he slips his handsdown the waistbandof your pantsthis is where you mustunderstand the differencebetween want and needyou may want that boybut you certainlydon’t need him”“i am a museum full of artbut you had your eyes shut”“people gobut howthey leftalways stays”“what i miss most is how you loved me. but what i didn’t know was how you loved me had so much to do with the person i was. it was a reflection of everything i gave to you. coming back to me. how did i not see that. how. did i sit here soaking in the idea that no one else would love me that way. when it was i that taught you. when it was i that showed you how to fill. the way i needed to be filled. how cruel i was to myself. giving you credit for my warmth simply because you had felt it. thinking it was you who gave me strength. wit. beauty. simply because you recognized it. as if i was already not these things before i met you. as if i did not remain all these once you left.”“loneliness is a sign you are in desperate need of yourself”“you tell mei am not like most girlsand learn to kiss me with your eyes closedsomething about the phrase—something abouthow i have to be unlike the womeni call sisters in order to be wantedmakes me want to spit your tongue outlike i am supposed to be proud you picked meas if i should be relieved you thinki am better than them”“other women’s bodiesare not our battlegrounds”“you were a dragon long beforehe came around and saidyou could flyyou will remain a dragonlong after he’s left”“you look at me and cryeverything hurtsi hold you and whisperbut everything can heal”“how you love yourself ishow you teach othersto love you”“what terrifies me most is how wefoam at the mouth with envywhen others succeedbut sigh in reliefwhen they are failingour struggle tocelebrate each other iswhat’s proven most difficultin being human”(Most of my favorite quotes were fromthe healingsection, and it was pretty though trying to narrow it down to my preferred quotes.)It also featured some pretty amazing illustrations, which I’m always up for in books:Overall, this collection was exquisite and exactly what I needed right now.milk and honeyis definitely going to stay on my mind for a while, and I hope to come back to it time and again.4.5 stars*Note: I'm an Amazon Affiliate.

The Sun and Her Flowers,"I don't know where to begin. Listen, as a brown woman of course I gave Rupi a try - that's what we brown girls do, we hold each other up and support each other like crazy because who else will? However, I think we should also be able to speak up when the work just doesn't cut it. Being critical is simply tough love - so don't be so quick to dismiss my negative feeback.First of all, half of this book are one-liners from her first book, and most of her longer pieces felt lazy and ill-thought out. I found myself skipping/ losing interest through most of them. Furthermore, I just can't ignore the more popular pieces she has claimed as her own when any avid reader can tell you they are not.Example 1 :""you must see no worth in yourselfif you find me worth lessafter you've touched meas if your hands on my bodymagnify youand reduce me to nothing"" - rupi kaursounds awfully familiar to my favorite quote by Kaija Sabbah:“If you consider a woman less pure after you’ve touched hermaybe you should take a looks at your hands.”Example 2: (This is from her first book)""She was music, but he had his ears cut off"" - Rupi Kaur""She was like a piano in a country where everyone has had their hands cut off."" - Angela CarterExample 3:""amanwho cries""- rupi kaur""i want more menwith flowers falling from their skinmore water in their eyesmore tremble in their handsmore women in their heartsthan on their bodiesmore softness in their heightmore honesty in their voice more wondermore humility in their eyes.""- Nayyirah WaheedExample 4:""Your voice does to mewhat autumn does to treesyou call to say helloand my clothes fall naturally""- rupi kaur(Okay aside from this just being hilarious, here's who she tried to copy)""I want to do with youwhat spring does with the cherry trees.""- Pablo Nerudaand""You wonder why I don'tanswer your 3 a.m. phone calls.When you say ""I miss you""I begin to undress myself out of habit.""-Sierra DemulderExample 5:""If you got any more beautifulthe sun would leave its placeand come for you""- rupi kaur“Had I told the seaWhat I felt for you,It would have left its shores,Its shells,Its fish,And followed me.”― Nizar Qabbani(Many of you have messaged be about the difference between plagiarism and inspiration, and this is my take on it:If ms. kaur is attempting to give a voice to women through her work, which she claims she is doing, then she should also acknowledge everyone who has ""inspired"" her. The debate her isn't whether she's a good poet or not, but if she has any integrity....which she clearly doesn't. Many women of color writers, specifically black women writers, have been silenced by her.This is the same woman who ""wrote"" the following:""I am the product of all the ancestorsgetting together and deciding these stories need to be told""???? How??? By erasing them? By taking their words and signing your name underneath them?and my favorite,""never trade honesty for relatability""Congrats y'all, she played you.)The pieces speaking about some of the hardest topics seem so surface level, I felt wrong reading it. I would never give this to my daughter. Not to mention the randomly sprinkled poems talking about her being an immigrant, all of them felt so out of place and awkward next to her other pieces.Anyways, I could go on and on about how much her work mirrors the work of lesser-known authors, but I think most readers already know this. I feel let down and embarrassed by this author and would never recommend it to anyone.I can only hope she grows up one day and finally finds her voice.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35606560-the-sun-and-her-flowers,The Sun and Her Flowers.txt
Home Body,"Mình biết đến cuốn sách này cũng được một thời gian rồi, hồi đó có thấy tác giả Rupi Kaur đăng thông tin trên tài khoản Instagram của cô ấy, mà giờ mình mới nhớ ra để down ebook về đọc. Cuốn sách này đã tìm đến mình (hoặc mình đã tìm đến sách) khá đúng thời điểm. Dạo gần đây, cõi lòng mình chất chứa đầy những tâm tư, suy nghĩ, đớn đau mà mình chỉ muốn chui vào căn phòng riêng để khóc cho thỏa. Thực sự, cuối tuần này mình đã khóc rất nhiều, một mình, trong phòng. Căng thẳng trong công việc chỉ đóng một phần rất nhỏ khiến cảm xúc của mình tuôn trào như thế thôi; chủ yếu là hình như nỗi đau khi sống gần 30 năm trong một gia đình đầy những bất công, chứng kiến mẹ mình cô đơn trong chính cuộc hôn nhân của bà, cuối cùng đã bắt kịp lấy tâm hồn mình. Nhất là khi mình chứng kiến bạn bè xung quanh mình can đảm yêu và can đảm lựa chọn hôn nhân, còn mình thì vẫn chưa thực sự dám phá bỏ bức tường mình đã tự xây dựng xung quanh trái tim mình để có thể thử yêu ai, luôn sợ hãi bất kỳ những cảm xúc lãng mạn nào, chỉ vì mình sợ mình sẽ lặp lại sai lầm của mẹ mình. Nỗi đau ấy có lẽ vẫn luôn thường trực trong mình, và có lẽ giờ đây nó đòi hỏi được chữa lành chăng?Và rồi mình đọc được“Home Body”, và rồi mình thấy cõi lòng mình nhẹ đi một chút. Và rồi mình thấy nỗi đau ấy, dẫu vẫn còn lưu lại ở đó, trong tâm hồn mình, nhưng đã bớt dữ dội đi phần nào, và trong khoảnh khắc, mình có thể thấy bản thân yên lòng được một chút…Tương tự như các tập thơ trước của Rupi Kaur mà mình đọc,“Home Body”đề cập đến nhiều vấn đề khác nhau, từ tình trạng tâm lý, những cảm xúc của mỗi cá nhân, cho đến các mối quan hệ độc hại, tình yêu, sắc tộc, sự bòn rút sức lực người lao động của các ông chủ lớn, niềm tin vào bản thân, chủ nghĩa nữ quyền,... Và đúng như phong cách viết tập thơ nào giờ của Rupi Kaur, các bài thơ trong“Home Body”cũng được chia thành các phần khác nhau theo các chủ đề, cụ thể là 4 phần riêng biệt, lần lượt là “mind”, “heart”, “rest”, “awake”. Mỗi phần đều có những đoạn thơ thật sự chạm đến tâm can mình, và mình sẽ ghi ra sau đây.Trong phần “mind”, Rupi Kaur đã đưa ra những cảm nhận rất chân thực, rất hợp lý về tất tần tật những thứ liên quan đến những suy nghĩ sâu thẳm bên trong những người nhạy cảm như mình. Như thể thơ của cô có khả năng nói chuyện trực tiếp với mình vậy. Đây là cách mà Rupi nói về chứng lo âu:“i have never known anything morequietly loud than anxiety”Còn đây chính xác là những gì mình đôi khi cảm thấy về chính bản thân mình - nỗi lo sợ rằng mình không đủ tốt như mình nghĩ, rằng mình sẽ không chạm được đến cái hình dung mà người khác nghĩ về mình:“i want to livei’m just afraidi won’t measure up to theidea people have of me in their headsi’m afraid of getting olderscared i’ll never write anythingworth reading againthat i’ll disappoint the peoplewho are counting on methat i’ll never learn how to be happy”Nhưng rồi thì, mình biết, đối với tình hình hiện giờ, tất cả những gì mình có thể làm là tin tưởng vào sự không chắc chắn của hiện tại, và nuôi dưỡng niềm tin rằng mình sẽ ở một nơi nào đó tốt hơn, phù hợp hơn trong tương lai:“i am trusting the uncertaintyand believing i willend up somewhereright and good”Mình không được định nghĩa bằng những ngày tồi tệ nhất của mình, khi áp lực công việc chỉ khiến mình muốn buông xuôi tất cả, khi nỗi đau trong mình cứ khiến nước mắt mình tuôn rơi. Mình là một chỉnh thể hoàn thiện, trọn vẹn của toàn bộ con người mình, một con người phức tạp:“i am not my worst daysi am not what happened to me”“i am not brokenbecause of the depressioni am not a lesser version of myselfbecause of the anxietyi am a wholecompleteand complicated person”Và nếu sau này mình gom đủ can đảm để yêu, thì mình muốn có một tình yêu như thế này:“most of my life has been spentwith the two of us touchingskin to skinour nights togetherand sometimes our daysyou carried me when my limbs refused towhen i was so sick i could not movenot once did you tire of my weightnot once did you complainyou’ve witnessed all my dreamsmy sexmy writingmy weepingevery vulnerable act of my lifehas been with youthe two of us knee-deep in laughterand when i’ve been a fool to trust a foolmade love on top of youleft for days only toreturn empty-handedyou always took me backwhen sleep abandoned mewe lay awake togetheryou are the embrace of my lifemy confessionalmy altari went from girl to woman on top of youand in the endit will be you—old frienddelivering me to death well rested”“What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger” - “Điều gì không thể giết được bạn thì sẽ khiến bạn mạnh mẽ hơn”. Có lẽ đây là con đường mình phải đi, là nỗi đau mình phải vượt qua để trở thành một phiên bản chiến binh mạnh mẽ mà mình tự hào được trở thành:“what we lived throughis living in usi am not a victim of my lifewhat i went throughpulled a warrior out of meand it is my greatest honor to be her”Và hãy luôn có hy vọng, hãy luôn tự bảo bản thân rằng “tôi sẽ”. Tôi sẽ vượt qua, tôi sẽ bước tiếp, dẫu cho nỗi đau như bóng tối bên trong mình cứ chực chờ kéo mình lại:“for the love of my lifei am trying my best to have hopei’ll keep greeting each morningwith an i willwhen it feels like i can’ti willi willi willmeet a day that will melt mei will move and the sadness willfall off my shouldersto make room for joyi will be full of colori will touch the sky againi want a paradei want musici want confettii want a marching bandfor the ones surviving in silencei want a standing ovationfor every person whowakes up and moves toward the sunwhen there is a shadowpulling them back on the inside”Và câu thơ này có lẽ là đúng nhất đây: nỗi đau là cánh cửa dẫn đến niềm vui. Có lẽ đúng thế, bởi nếu không biết đến nỗi đau thì làm sao chúng ta cảm nhận được hạnh phúc?“our pain is the doorway to our joy”Trong phần “heart”, Rupi Kaur đề cập đến chủ đề tình yêu và các mối quan hệ định nghĩa của một mối quan hệ độc hại và một mối quan hệ lành mạnh là như thế nào. Cô đã làm rất tốt trong việc dùng những từ ngữ giản đơn để miêu tả cảm xúc và suy nghĩ của nhiều người, đặc biệt là những phụ nữ trẻ như Rupi, khi yêu:“why does everythingbecome less beautifulonce it belongs to usit took me getting into a healthy relationshipto realize i shouldn’t be scaredof the person i love”Có lẽ đây cũng là một trong những lý do mình chưa đủ can đảm để yêu, vì mình luôn sợ bản thân không đủ tốt, không đủ tuyệt vời để ai đó ở lại, rằng sẽ luôn có người khác đẹp hơn, tuyệt vời hơn để thay thế mình…:“i’m afraid i won’t find the one who sees meand rushes to breathe me ini have a fear of seeming too desperatei’m scared i will be cheated onwith a woman more brilliantmore strikingmore of me in every wayterrified this will confirm what i know alreadythat i am not enough for someone to stay”Và đây là mình, dẫu có cô đơn đi chăng nữa thì cũng không bao giờ chấp nhận kìm hãm tinh hoa của mình lại để người mà mình hẹn hò cảm thấy thoải mái. Bởi vì mình biết rằng người nào thực sự yêu mình thì sẽ luôn muốn điều tốt đẹp nhất cho mình, và muốn giúp mình phát triển bản thân mình thêm chứ không phải nhún nhường để “xứng” với người đó:“i’m not going to pretendto be less intelligent than i amso a man can feelmore comfortable around methe one i deservewill see my greatness andwant to lift it higheri want someone who isinspired by my brilliancenot threatened by it”Với phần “rest”, Rupi Kaur một lần nữa đã đưa ra những quan điểm, nhận xét mà đối với mình là rất hợp lý về định nghĩa của thành công và năng suất làm việc. Ví dụ như:“we can workat our own paceand still besuccessful”Đây đích thị là bản miêu tả cực kỳ chính xác những gì mà cuộc sống bộn bề công việc đã thay đổi đời sống cá nhân của mình. Suốt tuần đi làm mệt mỏi quá rồi, cuối tuần mình chỉ muốn ở nhà thư giãn mà thôi, chả muốn đi đâu nữa…:“now we have our very important jobsthat fill up our very busy scheduleswe compare calendars just to plan coffee datesthat one of us eventually cancelscause adulthood is being too exhaustedto leave our apartments most days”Những đoạn thơ bên dưới chính xác là lý do vì sao chúng ta cần thay đổi cái nhìn về việc thế nào gọi là năng suất làm việc, hay cái gọi là “luôn luôn phải cải thiện bản thân”, nhất là đối với những người có thiên hướng làm nghệ thuật như tác giả:“productivity is not how muchwork i do in a daybut how well i balancewhat i need to stay healthy”“not everything you do hasto be self-improvingyou are not a machineyou are a personwithout restyour work can never be fullwithout playyour mind can never be nourished”“if you want to be creativeyou need to learn how todo stuff that has no purposeart isn’t made byworking all the timefirst you’ve got togo out and live”Còn đây là một đoạn thơ mình nghĩ đối với một đứa luôn thích giữ hình tượng như mình cần ghi nhớ để lâu lâu bung lụa cho thêm phần tự tin :D“i became confidentonce i decided that having funwas far more important thanmy fear of looking silly”“awake” là phần cuối của “Home Body”, chủ yếu tập trung vào self-love và các vấn đề xoay quanh nữ quyền, sự tự tin vào bản thân. Tác giả đã đưa ra cách thực sự để yêu lấy bản thân mình, đó là yêu cả những phần không hoàn hảo, những phần khó ưa luôn tồn tại trong mỗi chúng ta:“it’s easy to lovethe nice things about ourselvesbut true self-love isembracing the difficult partsthat live in all of us”Còn đây là một trong những đoạn thơ mình ấn tượng nhất trong toàn bộ tuyển tập, bởi tác giả đã yêu cầu định nghĩa lại cách dùng từ “pussy” (hay còn gọi là “bộ phận sinh dục nữ”). Nếu bạn nào rành tiếng Anh sẽ biết, từ “pussy” thường hay được dùng với nghĩa miệt thị, trong khi bộ phận sinh dục nữ là một bộ phận đầy can đảm. Nó đã chịu đựng nhiều đớn đau để mang không biết bao nhiêu sinh linh đến với thế giới này; khi nó có thể cho và nhận khoái cảm. Và nó xứng đáng được tôn vinh, chứ không phải bị xem thường:“oh but the pussy is bravelest we forgethow much painthe pussy can takehow much pleasure it deliversunto itself and othersrememberhow it spit you outwithout a flinchnow here you areusing the word pussylike an insultwhen you’re not evenstrong enough to be onelive loud and proud like you deserveand reject their bullshit definitionof what a woman should look like”Và đoạn thơ cuối, một lời nhắc nhở dành tặng tất cả mọi người: sẽ có nhiều thập kỷ thắng lợi tươi sáng thành công ở trước mắt nha:“you have only scratched the surfaceof what you’re capable ofthere are decadesof victories ahead of you”",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49656780-home-body,Home Body.txt
Bright Dead Things,"Ada Limón is an amazing poet, with a strong distinctive voice. A feminist, rough-edged, American Latina, Kentucky/NYC/California/Nebraska/Tennessee voice. It's very good.I'll show you some examples. I'll hide them under spoilers because I know some people don't like poetry. So, you can only read the ones that interest you or none at all.Feminist/womanhoodHOW TO TRIUMPH LIKE A GIRLI like the lady horses best,how they make it all look easy,like running 40 miles per houris as fun as taking a nap, or grass.I like their lady horse swagger,after winning. Ears up, girls, ears up!But mainly, let's be honest, I likethat they're ladies. As if this bigdangerous animal is also a part of me,that somewhere inside the delicateskin of my body, there pumpsan 8-pound female horse heart,giant with power, heavy with blood.Don't you want to believe it?Don't you want to lift my shirt and seethe huge beating genius machinethat thinks, no, it knows,it's going to come in first.Appreciating the little things in life:THE TREE OF FIREThe tree comes to mefor the first time in weeks.When did all its colors,like some commercial for dying,start shooting out of its skin?This morning, we fuckedeach other into a regularbackyard bonfire - cold woodturned to coal in the fine,fine flame. And now, this treebreaks into view, lurid red leavesthat demand a clanging,screaming alarm, and I think -this tree has been hereall this time, and I didn't notice.I swear, I'll try harder not tomiss as much: the tree, or howyour fingers under stillsleep-stunned sheetscoaxed all my colors back.God/ReligionMIRACLE FISHI used to pretend to believe in God. Mainly, I liked so much to talk to someone in the dark. Think of how far a voice must have to travel to go beyond the universe. How powerful that voice must be to get there. Once in a small chapel in Chimayo, New Mexico, I knelt in the dirt because I thought that's what you were supposed to do. That was before I learned to harness that upward motion inside me, before I nested my head in the blood of my body. There was a sign and it said, This earth is blessed. Do not play in it. But I swear I will play on this blessed earth until I die. I relied on a Miracle Fish, once, in New York City, to tell me my fortune. That was before I knew it was my body's water that moved it, that the massive ocean inside me was what made the fish swim.She writes A LOT of poems about death and watching her stepmother die of cancer. They're brutal, and very good reading. There's a whole chapter of the book dealing with poems on death and watching someone you love slowly die.I'll just put one of those in this review:Dealing with the death of a loved oneCOWERI'm cold in my heart, coal-hardknot in the mountain burieddeep in the boarded-up mine. So,I let death in, learn to prospectthe between-dreams of the dying,the one dream that tells you whento throw up, the other, whenyou're in pain. I tell youI will love someone that youwill never meet, death's warmbreath at the mouthof the body's holler.You are crying in the shower.I am crying near the shower.Your body a welcomed-redfire-starter in steam and I think,How scared I would beif I were death. How could Icome to this house, cometo this loved being, seethe mountains powerand dare blast you down.I dry you off and think,if I were death come to take you,your real-earth explosives,I would be terrified.She writes a lot about men, her exes, and her sexual experiences.Here's one liked about that topic,GLOWIn the black illegible moment of foolishwant, there is also a neon sign flashing,the sign above the strip joint where mysecond big love worked as a bouncerand saved the girls from unwanted hands,unpaid-for hands. Thin-lipped ladieswith a lot on their minds and more ontheir backs, loaded for bear, and forthe long winter's rain, loaded for real,and I've always been a jealous girl,but when he'd come home with a 4 a.m.stomp in his boots and undress to bed,he was fully there, fully in the room,my sleeping body made awake, awake,and there was a gentleness to this,a long opening that seemed to join usin the saddest hour. Before now, I don'tknow if I have ever loved anyone, or ifI have ever been loved, but men havebeen very good to me, have seenmy absurd out-of-place-ness, my bentgrin and un-called-for loud laughand have wanted to love me for it,have been so warm in their wantingthat sometimes I wanted to love them, too.And I think that must be worth something,that it should be a celebrated thing,that though I have not stood on a mountainunder the usual false archway of traditionand chosen one person forever, what I havedone is risked everything for that hour,that hour in the black night, where oneflashing light looks like love, I havepulled over my body's car and letmyself believe that the dance wasonly for me, that this gift of a breathingone-who-wants was always a gift,was the only sign worth stopping for,that the neon glow was a real star,gleaming in its dying, like us all,like us all.Being Latin@PRICKLY PEAR & FISTICUFFSMy older brother says he doesn't consider himself Latino anymore and I understand what he means, but I stare at the weird fruit in my hand and wonder what it is to lose a spiny layer. He's explaining how white and lower-middle-class we grew up and how we don't know anything about any culture except maybe Northern California culture, which means we get stoned more often and frown on super stores. I want to do whatever he says. I want to be something entirely without words. I want to be without tongue or temper. Two days ago in Tennessee someone said,Stop it, Ada's Mexican.And I didn't know what they were talking about until one of them said,At least I didn't say wetback.And everyone laughed. Honestly, another drink and I could have hit someone. Started the night's final fight. And I don't care what he says. My brother would have gone down swinging and fought off every redneck whitey in the room.She also has a great poem about her ex getting hit by a bus, and a great one about peeing outside like the pit bull bitch she was with at a car show with an inattentive boyfriend.... oh, there's so much good stuff in here but I can't transcribe the whole book for you! LOL LOL Much as I want to.Tl;dr - Sometimes I get the urge to read poetry. Perhaps you do, too? It's hard to know what's going on in the modern poetry world (MODERN) because it's not really discussed or paid attention to in everyday life by everyday people. So, I'm here to tell you that this is good stuff and you might want to give her poems a try if you are curious. Take a look below my review for some quotes of hers I added to GR, as well - they can offer you a glimpse of some poems I didn't share here.I'll definitely pick up another volume of hers. Insightful, slightly funny, feminist, and able to tackle the hard stuff without being maudlin or preachy. Excellent. I think I'm actually going to purchase this one....EDIT: 07/17/2022Ada Limón Is Named the Next Poet Laureate""Poetry, she said, can help the nation “become whole again” in a fraught, divided moment.""When Ada Limón quit her marketing job to try writing full time, she assumed that would mean writing fiction. So she spent her working hours imagining the lives of other people. Then, she said, she would plunge into poetry, where she could be herself.She never published a novel. But as a poet, she has been awarded the highest honor in her field: On Tuesday, the Library of Congress announced she will become the next poet laureate of the United States.Limón, who has published six books, will begin her tenure this fall as the 24th poet laureate, a position that has been held by some of the country’s most celebrated poets, including Louise Glück, Juan Felipe Herrera, Robert Hass and Tracy K.

Time Is a Mother,"‘Nobody’s free without breaking open.’2016 saw the rise of Ocean Vuong with his incredible and well-lauded debut collection of poetry. Deservedly so as Vuong has a gift of language to discuss difficult and painful subjects in a way that illuminates them in beauty.Time is a Mother, his second full-length volume of poetry, makes good on his early promises of excellence as Vuong examines grief from a multitude of vantage points, be it grief from loss of a loved one or a country. Following his debut novel,On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous, an autobiographically informed work that centers on the death of his mother, here we find poems that extend the theme and processing of grief, frequently drawing parallels between human and animal bodies as if to remind us that any loss is tragic. He simultaneously grieves the loss of cultural identity as one ages in the United States instead of a home country where the scars of war stand out in the family history of relocation. Vuong is at his best when playing with form and in the longer poems that give room for experimentation and compounding of an idea, andTime is a Motheris a gorgeous and heartbreaking collection that is as teeming with emotion as it is poetic integrity and execution.‘You’re smiling because the starsare just stars & you knowwe’ll only live oncethis time.’There are few aspects of life more universal than the mourning of death, and birth and the inevitability of dying are two things we all have in common. ‘Lest we forget, a morgue is also a community center,’ Vuong writes, and these poems are something we can all come together around and harmonize about the human condition.Time is a Motherfeels the natural follow-up to Vuong’s novel like an abstract afterword as commentary on what had transpired in the book but also a bridge forward to whatever will come next. In these pages we see the whole of Vuong’s life, such as family members, generational trauma, musings on identity and more culminate into the grieving process and an inward look at one’s small position in a vast universe as memories show they have emotional barbs and processing pain and feeling the weight of existence becomes a necessity to continue living.‘Because this mess I made, I made with love.’There are a wonderful variety of techniques utilized here, from short poems that deliver a staccatoed burst of images to multipage emotional epics and dense prose poems that read nearly like deleted scenes from Vuong’s novel. Personally, the more daring and experimental poems or longs ones work best for me, such as the poemReasns for Staying, an emotional knock-out inspired by his Vuong’s uncle who took his own life in 2012 that lists soul-stirring moments of life that uphold the beauty of existence. ‘Because they came in to my life, these ghosts, like something poured,’ he writes as he lists reasons to live that include rain falling on his partner’s shoulder, reading ‘my books by the light of riotfire,’ or ‘because this body is my last address.’In another poem he lists the Amazon purchases of his mother over the course of a year, a narrative of a life suddenly upended by cancer slowly and cleverly being revealed by the list of items in a way that touches on the way details of our lives become marketing data for corporations to sell us products. List poems appear several times in this collection, withOld Glorylisting common phrases to show how normalized violence and death is into our language. It makes us stop and consider how phrases like telling someone to “go in guns blazing” might not seem like positive encouragement to someone who has experienced war or been a family of refugees. Some of the later poems are written as dense prose poems, which aren’t my favorite personally, but Vuong packs a lot of emotion into them.‘Because the fairy tales were right. You’ll need sorcery to make it out of here.’The grief in these poems is not only for those who have passed, but also for the living who are marginalized by society. ‘I used to be a fag now I’m a checkbox,’ he writes inNot Evena poem that later details a scene where a white woman tells him he is lucky that his identity as a queer immigrant lets him write about war and sexuality. ‘Because everyone knows yellow pain, pressed into American letters, turns to gold,’ he remarks, commenting on how his griefs aren’t simply a marketing trick and that the idea of being jealous of it is rather disturbing.Time is a Motheris an impactful collection that shows Vuong has plenty more to say and will continue to be a big name in poetry. While it doesn’t hit me as strongly as the first collection, which is so endlessly quotable, it is still quite an impressive collection that resonates and left me thinking of these poems when I was away from them. May we be reading Ocean Vuong for a long time to come.3.75/5‘How else do we return to ourselves but to foldThe page so it points to the good part.’",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58582927-time-is-a-mother,Time Is a Mother.txt
Depression & Other Magic Tricks,"Depression and Other Magic Truths is by Sabrina Benaim, Canadian poetess, spoken word and dance performer, she lives in Toronto. This superb debut poetry collection explores many truths surrounding the stigma of mental illness: depression is no longer a taboo topic, the many ways of coping and working through episodes, and most important, the path to recovery and wellness is possible.Close to her mother, Benaim was concerned how she will talk to her: “explaining my depression to my mother”. In the darkness of her illness she fears death—not her own but her mother’s. Leaning on her mother for support she writes: “I am afraid of living/Mom, I am lonely/I think I learnt it when Dad left;/how to turn the anger into lonely/the lonely into busy…” Parental abandonment is difficult to deal with in any case, and was symbolized by an abandoned house.In the poem “single” Benaim writes about her fondness for sweat pants, careless grooming habits, and avoidance of answering the phone. “the loneliest sweet potato” recalls going to the supermarket, the effort to hide her depression as she chooses her lemons and avocados, the effort it takes to appear like everyone else. “how to unfold a memory//the Kentucky heartbreak shuffle” is a telling longer autobiographical poem of rural country life: barrels of Kentucky Bourbon, cornmeal fried catfish, the street lamps, swings on the wrap around porches, the American Flags, and the sweltering heat.It was surprising that the organized poetic sequences beginning with “magic trick 001” to the final “magic trick 005” deal with symbolism and creative metaphorical lyrics. Many of these verses feature an enjoyable lighter direction, away from the seriousness of depressive illness. The titles of most of the poems are usually featured in lower case: “so my friend tells me she identifies as a mermaid”- “on platonic love being the real thing”- seven small ways in which I loved myself this week” .On occasion, Beyonce serves as a popular muse in modern (Millennial) poetry. Benaim’s poems that include Beyonce: “dear Beyonce” (I)- “dear Beyonce” (II). Previously, “There Are More Beautiful Things Than Beyonce” (2016) was a poetry release by Morgan Parker. Beyonce appeared on social media in her maternal glory over the summer (2017)-- inside a spectacular floral arch with her newborn “beybe” twins.This thoughtful insightful collection is hopeful and encouraging, illustrating numerous ways Benaim faced her troubles and depressive symptoms—fortunately she wrote poetry, found love and happily recovered. **With thanks to Button Poetry/Exploding Pinecone Press via NetGalley for the direct e-copy for the purpose of review.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34594982-depression-other-magic-tricks,Depression & Other Magic Tricks.txt
Crush,"This is a grief-stricken, painfully loving, violently obsessive collection that feels like a frantic stream of consciousness, with each poem twining together to create a story in feelings. It’s a bit fragmented at times, lending to the air of desperation. It doesn’t feel as though Siken is composing these words as much as they are flowing out of him uncontrollably and it is a matter of life and death that he gets all the words down. These poems are the grief of a mourning man put into words. They are his shame, his fears, his longing, his loneliness. There is a violence associated with this love because of the circumstances of it and the self-hating that can come with being queer in a time/place that it is not accepted that reminds me quite a bit of the violent thoughts inThese Violent Delights, which I found to be especially prominent in “Wishbone” and “Driving, Not Washing”. There is so much content in these poems, but it all whittles down to Siken’s raw emotions, which overpower the narrative, as his cyclical writing forces us to go round and round with him on this repetitive ride that he is stuck in.Louise Glück writes an incredible forward for this collection and I can’t say it better than her when she said: “That Silken turns life into art seems, in these poems, psychological imperative rather than literary ploy: the poems substitute the repeating cycles of ritual for linear progressive time—in Crush, the bullet enters the body and then returns to the gun. . . the poems are driven by what they deny; their ferocity attests to the depth of their terror, their resourcefulness to the intractability of the enemy's presence.""Below, I’ve copied down some excerpts and full poems that I really love.

Night Sky with Exit Wounds,"Notwithstanding his youth, by the timeNight Sky with Exit Woundswas published in early 2016, Ocean Vuong was already well-known as a exciting new poet, with poems inAmerican Poetry Review, Gulf Coast, The New Yorker, The Poetry Reviewand other prominent poetry journals. So it was with much anticipation that I read this book. I regrettably say I was disappointed, partly because I expected a lot more in the way of a wunderkind's talent, with poetry that was as sophisticated as it was effusively expressive. Too many poems fall within a class that meets Terry Eagleton's characterization of Dylan Thomas's ""A Refusal to Mourn the Death, by Fire, of a Child in London,"" in which ""an elaborateness of form conceals a paucity of content."" Perhaps, Thomas's work is a fitting parallel, where his word music and emotion often outstripped the ideas that eventually drowned in the poem. The best poetry informs, opens vistas on the way we perceive ourselves. Thomas wrote some remarkable poems, but Thomas's reputation has dimmed considerably for the very faults to which Vuong falls prey.As an initial observation, Vuong’s linguistic choices sometimes confused me. ""Threshold"" begins: ""In the body, where everything has a price/I was a beggar."" This sentence, as the poem later bears out, requires a broadly metaphoric construction, one not limited to the ""body"" ascorpus, but rather to the effect of ""in alife, where everything has its price,"" and where ""beggar"" is indicative of the absence of something essential, which in this case is not monetary at all. At the poem's conclusion, however, we find the ""price"" trope leveraged as a word game (""I didn’t know thecost/of entering a song – was tolose/your way back"" [my italics]), which diminishes its aesthetic effect and frustrates the expectations aroused by the poem's introductory line. I also had difficulty with the poem's only simile, an awkward and perplexing figure: ""His voice—//it filled me to the core/like askeleton"" (my italics). One cannot easily shrug the morbidity of ""skeleton,"" but even more to the point, the comparison is inept; a skeleton doesn't ""fill"" a body. The sense, I believe, is that the father's voice provided something that was elementally missing from the son's life; although, as we later learn, the father was mainly notable for his willful absence, and so it is difficult for the reader to make the emotional connection that Vuong evidently feels. In this and more than a few other poems, Vuong betrays a cognitive dissonance where the art either forces us to cross a bridge too far or collapses under its own weight.""Threshold"" serves as a preamble that sets the tone for the rest of the book. It figures the poet, as a child, on his knees and looking through the keyhole of the bathroom door as his father sings in the shower. His submissiveness is practiced in order to gain access to his father’s inner life and, as we learn in later poems, to make the mythic connection between his ""Telemachus"" (the title of the following poem) and his father’s ""Odysseus."" Though, in poems like ""Telemachus,"" ""Odysseus Redux,"" ""Eurydice,"" ""Trojan"" and others, Vuong's narrative persona takes on an air of grandiosity. If this were theater, it would come off as a serious case of overacting:Back from the wind, he called to mewith a mouthful of crickets-smoke & jasmine risingfrom his hair. I waitedfor the night to waneinto decades-before reachingfor his hands. Then we dancedwithout knowing it: my shadowdeepening his on the shag.(""Odysseus Redux"")This has the miasma of T.S. Eliot's orotund Tiresias. The risk of this epic association with classic myth today, however, is that it acts as a foil to contemporary existence, as Jean-François Lyotard argued. If used seriously, as it was until the mid-20th century, one must retreat to the notion that grand narratives universally speak to us, despite the fact that our diverse orientations, perspectives, desires and needs say otherwise. But the real reason for treating classic Greek, Latin and Hebrew myth as a disability is, of course, that the old myths are as dead as the languages that first contained them, and contemporary readers who are not scholars cannot be expected to understand their purpose in a given poem. It would have been more interesting if Vuong had exploited Vietnamese myth and folklore, rather than the old Greek tales with all their Freudian baggage. Indeed, when Vuong brings the Vietnam war into a number of poems (such as ""A Little Closer to the Edge,"" ""Aubade for Burning City"" and ""Self-Portrait as Exit Wounds""), it admirably serves as the field upon which the vital myth of family can freely stir the blood ofNight Sky with Exit Wounds.As a rule, Vuong tries too hard to make his conceits startling. He turns tricks with enjambments three too many times and introduces metaphors and symbols that don't seem to serve a purpose other than for shock effect. For Vuong no intensification of the image is enough, with shatterings, cracks, swellings, gasps, breakings and trauma galore, in turn made even more so by the replete introductions of bones, bullets, bombs, feculence, ordure, sex and death. The senses are heavily assaulted in poem after poem, and one wonders whether the gentle reader, at some point, will give up on Vuong's pretensions and perforce accept the poetry as surreal projections of a mind needy for attention.Further, Vuong lets no conceit rest on his laurels, but he must extend it to the breaking point as in, for example, ""Devotion"":Because the differencebetween prayer & mercyis how you movethe tongue. I press mineto the navel's familiarwhorl, molasses threadsdescending towarddevotion. & there's nothingmore holy than holdinga man's heartbeat betweenyour teeth, sharpenedwith too muchair.While the conceit (the purported difference between ""prayer and mercy"" in the motion of the tongue) is flawed from inception, as a practical matter of versification, the last phrase, ""sharpened with too much air,"" adds little to the expression and dulls the pointed combination of sexuality with the poetic by pushing the conceit ""too much."" This happens in many other poems, where figurations are overburdened and force the tropes from sense into nonsense.We observe this fault clearly in his ""Ode to Masturbation,"" a catalogue of one over-the-top trope after another, with the mixed effect of exhilarating images and ideas that repeatedly lose their way:you whose namenot heardby the earbut the smallestbonesin the graves youwho ignite the april airwith all your petals'here here hereyouwho twistthrough barbed-wired lightdespite knowinghow color beckonsdecapitation . . .The transitions are vacant intensifications, for Vuong uses words to arouse the reader's emotions and nothing else. So we have phrases like ""sanford towns/whose trees know/the weight of history/can bend their branches/to breaking//lines whose roots burrow/through stones and hard facts,” essentially an aleatory run-on of ideas that provide a surplus of ""special effects"" to make a blockbuster out of a poem with too little to say. The poem fails most notably in its conclusion:don'tbe afraidto be thisluminousto be so bright soemptythe bullets passright through youthinkingthey have foundthe sky as you reachdown pressa handto this blood-warm bodylike a wordbeing nailedto its meaning& livesBecause of their conjunction here, the words ""bright"" and ""empty"" lose their compass; the phrase ""bullets pass/right through you/thinking/they have found/the sky,"" which ingenuously ascribes sentience to the inanimate (a Romantic affectation), makes ""bullets"" cartoonish and ""sky"" virtually nonexistent; and the awe the poet intends to instill with the last trope is flat-footed, as Vuong, one more time, exhausts Christian myth as metaphor (in a poem purportedly about masturbation). Yet, it is the vain mortgaging of all that was invested to bring us to this point in the poem, which Vuong then cheaply rolls into a simple grammatical trope, that bathetically reduces its value to nil. Here masturbation becomes just another metaphor for logorrhea.Certainly Vuong's main fault is that he makes problematic choices because he overwrites. In ""The Smallest Measure,"" he portrays a father teaching his son to hunt, drawing forth the boy's sympathetic response to the hunted doe, which does double duty as the poet's alter ego in bloated language:Heavy with summer, Iam the doe whose one hoof cockslike a question ready to openroots. & like any god-forsaken thing, I want nothing morethan my breaths. To liftthis snout, carvedfrom centuries of hunger, toward the nextlow peach bruisingin the season's clutch.One might casually overlook Vuong's self-indulgence in caricature with phrases like ""Heavy with summer,"" ""any god-forsaken thing"" and ""snout, carved/ from centuries of hunger,"" as well as the now customary Vuong signature of trauma in ""low peach bruising//in the season's clutch"" (describing the maturing peach). Vuong's device here is to make the poem from the doe's POV, endowing it not only with a poetic sensibility, but with omniscience as well. The matter is further complicated by the following lines:Once I came nearenough to a man to smella woman's scentin his quiet praying-as some will do before raisingtheir weapons closerto the sky.The ""woman's scent"" in the ""quiet praying"" of the man could be a reference to the traditional hunt-seduction metaphor, or alternatively, a comment about sensitivity, empathy and even squeamishness (which is traditionally and unfairly made a female trait). Traditionally, if there is any praying in hunting, it is a prayer that God bless the hunter with success which, in turn, will please a woman who expects food on her table. This brings us back to the other side of the seduction metaphor. How the doe should sense the prayer from a women's scent or its relationship to hunting is as problematic as the doe POV, which unnecessarily complicates the poet's relationship to the material and makes us suspect the whole poem as metaphor, one adverse to the poem's professed theme.When the boy cannot bring himself to pull the trigger and weeps, the father's understanding and gentleness is portrayed to great effect, as he takes the gun away from the boy and touches the boy's head with his own:I seean orange cap touchingan orange cap. No, a manbending over his sonthe way the hunted,for centuries, must bendover its own reflectionto drink.The problem, however, is that the pathos in the gesture between father and son has been compromised by the comparison with that of the hunted animal drinking: one act is a matter of compassionate choice, the other an ordinary necessity of life. The Romantic strain in Vuong poetry elevates the natural scene of a doe drinking to a significance that in unearned and unduly presumptive. Themannerand not the substance of the act is made to govern the simile. Also, the hunter is compared to the hunted (again, in the doe's mind) so that it distorts the tenor and vehicle relationship, the net effect of which renders it mawkish, giving it the character of a Disney cartoon rather than reveal a poetic truth. Even more disconcerting, the whiff of a sexual subtext that Vuong has subtly implied, whether consciously or unconsciously, runs at cross purposes with the theme of the poem, which is ostensibly about the emotional relationship between a father and son (one of the main discourses of the book).These are just a few illustrations that reveal a fundamental misunderstanding of the textual effect of the writing, where similes, metaphors and symbols are routinely overtaxed to weaken rather than strengthen the poetry, all too frequently going beyond what is clearly sufficient and adding the extra brick that topples the wall.Lastly, a note about the book's rhetorical style as it relates to the poet's credibility. Vuong describes his family history in graphically detailed and unequivocally melodramatic terms, and, as discussed above, drawn Greek myth into the mix. Though he was not born at the time when the Vietnam war events occurred, the journey that brought his family to the U.S. is depicted as nothing less than Promethean with Hollywood-style highlights (e.g., his parents make love in a bomb crater). The portrayals are vivid and affecting, and Vuong's poetry is luminous even as the subject matter is lurid and unsettling. But one questions the epic character of the underlying events, which Vuong could not have personally witnessed, just as one naturally questions his psychic impersonation of Jacqueline Kennedy (""Of Thee I Sing"") at one of the most traumatic and intimately reported events in American history, viz., the assassination of her husband, the U.S. president, in 1963. I think it was a mistake to include ""Of Thee I Sing"" in this volume because the assassination, even absent reference to it, relates to the Vietnam war. One may rightly dismiss Vuong's quixotic projection into Jackie Kennedy's soul as pure camp, but if that occurs then the authenticity of his family portraits is suspect.In the end I found the technical difficulties in narrative and figuration, as well as Vuong's melodramatic style, frustrating my attempts to enjoy many of the poems. These are common faults in young poets, even those who display exceptional talent, as Vuong. However, this debut falls woefully short of others I have read in the last year, particularly Sarah Howe'sLoop of Jadeand Andrew McMillan'sPhysical. Admittedly, those poets seem to me more self-aware about what is happening on the page. I'm not sure Vuong understands the aesthetic nature of his work yet. He's got poetry in his blood, no doubt, and I suspect that he will assert more control over his material as time goes on. Certainly, he's quite capable of renderings that can touch a raw nerve in the reader's cortex. His future success will depend upon a maturation that moves beyond the special effects. Thus, despite my overall opinion of this book (which, I acknowledge, runs against the grain of overwhelming public acclamation), there are some very good poems here that any poet would envy. Whether or not you are receptive to Vuong's charms, the book should be read, for its failures as much as for its successes.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23841432-night-sky-with-exit-wounds,Night Sky with Exit Wounds.txt
Pillow Thoughts,"// I received an ARC of this book via Netgalley in exchange of an honest review //""I hate to spoil the endingbut You is fineYou is still hereYou is going to make it""I like how each section is labeled on what you are feeling right now and what mood you are in when you read it. I have always wished there were poems books that were like this because it would be so helpful. . . and now I found one.Some of the poems were too straight forward for my taste and I was not a fan of all of them. This was actually my only main problem the whole time I was reading it. But there were ones that really touched me (like, seriously, they touched my heart. . . literally one tear drop down my eye type) and I liked how the poems are not just thrown together and there is actually some find of flow to it in each section if you pay attention to it enough. A lot are pretty much related in a way.

Ariel,"“This is the light of the mind, cold and planetary.The trees of the mind are black. The light is blue.The grasses unload their griefs on my feet as if I were God,Prickling my ankles and murmuring of their humility.”In “The Moon and the Yew Tree” Sylvia Plath presents, not a vision of the picturesque English churchyard outside her bedroom window, but a mental landscape with more melancholy, more solemnity, more Gothic gloom than any representation of physical reality could ever have.It is a scene of austere resignation to destiny. Nothing mitigates the blackness. Terror is kept at bay only by a fatalistic acceptance of the merciless moon’s indifference to human suffering. Plath looks out of her window and knows she is home. “I live here,” she says without emotion.But Plath would have it otherwise if she could. She would like to believe in tenderness.“The moon is my mother. She is not sweet like Mary.Her blue garments unloose small bats and owls.How I would like to believe in tenderness—The face of the effigy, gentled by candles,Bending, on me in particular, its mild eyes.”Before “Lady Lazarus,” before “Edge,” there was “The Moon and the Yew Tree.” I like to read the three poems as a group. Together they tell a story of despair, anger, and bitter defiance.Written less than sixteen months before her death, “The Moon and the Yew Tree” establishes a mood, an ambiance, that fades into the background with “Lady Lazarus” and then returns to the fore in the last lines of “Edge.” Plath has not yet adopted the bravado of “Lady Lazarus” here, but it is easy to see the progression from the deliberate matter-of-fact voice in this cold dark poem to the proud death-defying persona of the later poem.“I have done it again.One year in every tenI manage it—”Then there is the moon imagery and the aura of inevitability. “I simply cannot see where there is to get to.” The line, uttered with deadpan acumen, foreshadows the decree of finality in “Edge,” her final poem. “Her bare/Feet seem to be saying:/We have come so far, it is over.” The bare feet that prophesy this end are the feet of the girl who walks through the moonlit landscape like God.Plath’s emphasis is everywhere on rebirth: the moon, Lazarus, the phoenix. Do you want to know what it feels like to come back from the dead? Do you really want to know? The challenge is offered and it must not be accepted lightly, for it is a dark vision.It is easy for casual observers to dismiss her, to take refuge in ignorance and to feign contempt so that they can deny their own demons. Who would walk through Plath’s landscape with its cold blue light, its black trees, its bats, owls, and headstones, who would gaze at the yew tree and follow its line, up, up to the remote unfeeling moon, must be made of harder stuff than the common run of men and women are made of.Plath stares her observers down. She smirks in the faces of her detractors. And she boasts in a loud clear voice, a voice clear as a bell—or a bell jar. Plath is no penitent. Her confession is revelation, not repentance.“DyingIs an art, like everything else.I do it exceptionally well.I do it so it feels like hell.I do it so it feels real.I guess you could say I’ve a call.”She is never contrite. On the contrary, her attitude toward suicide is cavalier. “Lady Lazarus” is a haughty poem. She tells it like it is, sugar-coating nothing. She refuses to restrain her rage or soften her voice. Let those who would scorn her, scorn her, but first let them shudder at the violence of her imagery. Let them wince and recoil as she looks them dead in the eyes and says: “They had to call and call/And pick the worms off me like sticky pearls.”Plath makes no apologies.“What a million filaments.The peanut-crunching crowdShoves in to seeThem unwrap me hand and foot—The big strip tease.Gentlemen, ladies.”It is the vulgar spectators, their flaccid mouths agape, their vacuous eyes agog, that so offend. Plath does not cast her gaze earthward and dig her toe around in the dirt, stammering out the obligatory and obsequious phrases that appease the peanut-crunching crowd. She does not hide her face from the gibbering mob, from those whose mockery conceals their own fear, whose insults spring from the senseless cruelty of their puerile and unenlightened minds.Reading “Lady Lazarus,” I hear Plath’s saucy voice above the bleating of the herd. If they want to look, let them look. Let them look and gape and drool.“It’s easy enough to do it in a cell.It’s easy enough to do it and stay put.It’s the theatricalComeback in broad dayTo the same place, the same face, the same bruteAmused shout:‘A miracle!’That knocks me out.”The trick is not to mind the voyeurs, to welcome them, to put on a good show. Instead of tenderness there is always brute amusement. She does not keep her secret nestled to her bosom, protected and sheltered, for the audience would have it out and, not content to take a brief and humble look and then pass on, each man, woman, and child would feel compelled to gawk and jeer and perhaps poke at it with a stick.Better to put it on display herself, hang a sign, charge admission. Better to hold her head high and thrust out her chest, work the crowd, be barker and freak in one, expose her scars to all and sundry. And why stop there? Let them come a little closer and smell the smell of death that still clings to her garments. It is good to remember that it is they who are terrified.“There is a chargeFor the eyeing of my scars, there is a chargeFor the hearing of my heart—It really goes.And there is a charge, a very large chargeFor a word or a touchOr a bit of bloodOr a piece of my hair or my clothes.So, so, Herr Doktor.So, Herr Enemy.”She will exhume the past, but before she does she would like to talk price. There is a charge, after all. It is betrayal that hurts the most, not the scrutiny of the multitude. Looking out into the audience, there is only a sea of interchangeable faces. They are of no consequence. It is the betrayal of a loved and trusted one that crushes. To believe in one, to have faith in one—just one, is to risk all.“I turn and burn.Do not think I underestimate your great concern”I think there is a sordid fascination people have with other people’s suicides. Plath knew this when she wrote “Lady Lazarus.” In order to probe ever deeper into the private world of the suicidal mind they affect concern. Candor is not for these frauds. Melodrama, sensationalism, the shocking lurid details are enough for the curious. It is all they really want anyway. True candor, the guided tour and backstage pass are for the select few, the one, possibly for none at all.Plath’s poetry is triumphant. It is her victory over death and over the scavengers who feed upon it. And it is an invitation to all of us to face the past with courage and dignity and even a little bit of arrogance.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/395090.Ariel,Ariel.txt
The Universe of Us (Volume 4),"Q:Remember, your words are your power. Never forget your words. (c)Q:We drift from star to star, your soul and mine as one (c)Wow! This is unexpectedly cool, poetic and evocative! I might become a fan!I feel the need to memorise half this book...Beware of spoilers!!!Q:Magic tumbled from her pretty lips and when she spoke the language of the universe—the stars sighed in unison. —Michael FaudetI believe we think more deeply about the universe when we’re falling in love. I think the mysterious pull that draws you to another person is identical to the one that moves our eyes upward to the stars. ...As a child, I always loved the romance of the night sky. While writing this new body of work, I revisited that sense of wonder and fascination that I have held as far back as I can remember. The sentiment can be best described as a mixture of nostalgia and longing.In many ways, a book is, in itself, a tiny universe. Each page is like a newly formed galaxy, fashioned from a single, pulsing thought. A book travels for days, for years, sometimes for centuries to meet you at an exact point in time.I hope you enjoy The Universe of Us as much as I have enjoyed putting it together. I like to think it has found you for a reason, even if that reason is only to draw your eyes skyward once more. (c)Q:I would blanket the world in utter darkness; I would pull back the veil of light and reveal to you a blinding crescendo of stars.I would drain all the seven seas and ask you to count—one by one—every grain of sand that clings to the ocean floor.I would tally the beat of every human heart that has echoed since the dawn of our becoming.And as you look in awe at the sheer magnitude of my admission, I would take your hand in mine and tell you; if only you had let me, this is how much I could have loved you.(c)Q:To stretch out my hand and touch the soft, yielding warmth of your skin. But now I have learned the secret of distance. Now I know being close to you was never about the proximity. (c)Q:To the man I love, to my future.The first time I felt your presence, I began joining the dots in the sky, wondering when our stars would align. ...I know you and I are the same in that way—we bruise a little more easily than most. You see, our souls were made in the same breath.I know I’m running late—I’m sorry. Things haven’t worked out the way I planned. But believe me when I tell you I am on my way.Until then, think of me, dream of me and I will do the same. One day I will learn your name, and I will write it somewhere on this page. And we will realize that we have known each other all along.(c)Q:There is something so delicate about this time, so fragile. And if nothing ever comes of it, at least I have known this feeling, this wonderful sense of optimism. It is something I can always keep close to me—to draw from in my darkest hour like a ray of unspent sunshine. No matter what happens next, I will always be glad to know there is someone like you in the world. (c)Q:Your LifeYou’ve wandered off too far,you’ve forgotten who you are;you’ve let down the ones you love,you’ve given up too much.You once made a deal with time,but it’s slipping by too fast;you can’t borrow from the future,to make up for the past.You forsake all that you hold dear,for a dream that is not your own;you would rather live a lie—than live your life alone (c)Q:if I am so hard to love, then let me run wild. My love is not a testament to my surrender....I will never give you what you want in chains. (c)Q:But tomorrow, tomorrow could be different, and that is what keeps me going today. (c)Q:Are you okay; because I love you.Are you okay; because I need you.Are you okay; because I don’t know how to live without you. (c)Q:We may not be in love anymore, but you’re still the only one who knows me. (c)Q:When was the last time you felt like someone knew you and not the person you’ve been pretending to be. When was the last time you felt like yourself. (c)Q:A LessonThere is a girl who smiles all the time,to show the world that she is fine.A boy who surrounds himself with friends,wishes that his life would end.For those that say they never knew—the saddest leave the least of clues (c)Q:It was a kind love, a selfless love. I was a dreamer, and you were a traveler. We met at the crossroads. I saw love in your smile, and I recognized it for the first time in my life. But you had a plane to catch, and I was already home. (c)Q:Yes, I think it is entirely possible to fall in love with someone you’ve never met. Physicality is an expression of intimacy—not an indication of it. (c)Q:A Winter LoveWe were likethe raging sea,a winter lovethat could not be.Our voices werethe ocean’s roar,we cried untilwe could cry no more.We mocked the stormsand they fell the trees,our broken limbsamong scattered leaves.The tides had shownwhat we did not heed,the water holds—and then recedes. (c)Q:Her TimeShe has been feeling it for awhile—that sense of awakening. There is a gentle rage simmering inside her, and it is getting stronger by the day. She will hold it close to her—she will nurture it and let it grow. She won’t let anyone take it away from her. It is her rocket fuel and finally, she is going places. She can feel it down to her very core—this is her time. She will not only climb mountains—she will move them too. (c)Q:I have walked through the ruins of an empire as it fell through the passageway of time. I have witnessed star after star exploding like fireworks, as I fixed my gaze light-years into the sky. (c)Q:EpiphanyHere are the words that have brought me to a new understanding. Here are the words that will bind us forever. From this day forward, I will speak your name with gratitude, knowing it is the mantra of my soul. I will let you go, knowing we are eternal. We were born to walk this world in intersecting lines. We are circles and signposts and parallels. I have left markers for you at every turn. Look for me in everything that catches your breath. Let the simple miracle of your own presence overwhelm you. For you are beautiful, in ways that can’t be described. And we are love at its most inexplicable. With these words, I am one with divinity. With these words, I am one with you. (c)Q:Are you like me? Are you alive or just pretending? (c)Q:AwakeI was loved in my dreams last night. It echoed through me like thunder—I felt it through and through.When I woke up, I couldn’t shake the feeling of his arms around me and the sound of his voice, already half forgotten.The loss was indescribable. And I couldn’t help that feeling of certainty that I have felt this way before. Somewhere in time, throughout the ages, I was loved—I was loved and my eyes were wide open. (c)Q:Nine LivesDoes the past ever appear before you, like a bolt in the blue? Something or someone from many lives ago. It knocks you right off your feet, just when you thought you’d found solid ground. But it’s only an illusion, isn’t it? (c)Q:A Beautiful CollisionThere was a feeling of inevitability when I met you. The sense that we would be together; that there would be a moment when you would look at me in a certain way, and we would cross the threshold from friendship into something so much more.We spoke once about lovers who kept finding each other, no matter how many times the world came between them. ...But our bodies are made of stardust, and we are hurtling through space and time, toward the most beautiful collision. (c)Q:She walks the earth freely, yet her feet never touch the ground. Many hands will reach for her, but she cannot be anchored. She belongs to no one, to nothing, to nowhere. When you meet her, you will recognize her for who she is—a free spirit, a wandering star. (c)Q:The EssenceI saw a swaying tree,I felt it sway in me.A bird trilled out her song,To me this song belongs.What’s given is not gone—in something it lives on (c)Q:She doesn’t know how she came to be like this, how she ended up here. She only remembers the way she used to be—wild and reckless. Bold and unapologetic. (c)Q:CirclesMy mind, a Venn diagram.You, the overlap and the intersect;a pulsating glimmer—omnipresent,a lighthouse with its glowing breath.You are the stone that skirts the river,that skips along its crystal plane;a surface skimmed by concentric shimmer,and trembles with the touch of rain.You are worlds that spin in orbit,a star who rose and fell;infinity summoned for audit—a penny toss in the wishing well (c)Q:Tell me where to put the stars. Show me how the oceans keep spilling over. Your smile is a blazing trail of light, shot down from the heavens. (c)Q:HeHe is the thought behind the feeling,the swelling in my chest;the starlight in the evening,the yearning when I undress.He is the sound behind the sighing,the song of every bird;the tears in all my crying,the ache in every word (c)Q:He and I collided like two predestined stars and in that brief moment I felt what it was like to be immortal.

Love That Dog,"Sharon Creech's 2001 novel in verseLove that Doghas indeed been a very much unexpectedly wonderful and lovely reading surprise for me (as I have tended to have some reading issues with regard to Creech as an author). For simply but also totally and utterly textually delightfully (and with a subdued but ever present and strongly rendered emotionality), Sharon Creech withLove that Dogsimply but totally delightfully presents how Jack, how the young first person narrator is wonderfully and lastingly inspired by his teacher Miss Stretchberry to not only learn to appreciate poetry as a literary genre but to also then write, to compose his own verses (and this even though at the beginning ofLove that Dog, Jack is shown by Sharon Creech as being pretty much stubbornly resistant to all poetry and that he thinks reading and even more so writing verses something that only girls but not boys tend to do). And with Jack within the pages ofLove that Doglearning what poetry signifies and means, that there are many different types of poetic forms, and using the poets that Miss Stretchberry introduces in class to write adaptations of authors like William Blake, William Carlos Williams, Robert Frost, Valerie Worth, Walter Dean Myers etc. (with the the latter, with Walter Dean Myers even visiting Jack's class),Love that Dogbasically concludes with Jack's erstwhile negative attitude towards poetry having been totally changed to one of positivity (by both Miss Stretchberry's teachings but also and perhaps even more so by his, by Jack's own experiences writing poetry, by adapting the poets being featured in class to and for his own experiences and realising that penning verses is not only something fun and engaging but also something magically and delightfully healing).Furthermore but also really significantly and importantly (and especially regarding the already briefly alluded to assessment of poetry being something therapeutic in nature), inLove that Dog, Sharon Creech also and marvellously demonstrates how with the poems Jack is writing, and which as the story moves along increasingly feature Jack's dog Sky as a subject and as a theme, he is, Jack is able to both come to terms with his dog's recent death (and even to write about how Sky was killed) and also to use his verses as a way to both pay homage to his deceased pet and to also remember Sky fondly and with ever decreasing bitterness. And definitely, even though the thematics of a deceased pet inLove that Dogseems to actually quite bother some readers/reviewers, for me, the story as it is being presented by Sharon Creech inLove that Dogand how Jack experiences healing, poetical joy and being able to remember Sky without too much pain and trauma after writing verses about his dog, in particular for my inner child, this is oh so emotionally heartening and also very much personally relatable (as I did indeed also pen childhood poems when our family dog and one of my favourites of our horses died rather suddenly and that this totally made me feel better and less saddened).Highly recommended and five stars forLove that Dog(with my only and totally minor annoyance being that although I do appreciate the information on poetry in general at the back and the list of the poems/poets being used by Miss Stretchberry, I also kind of wish that Sharon Creech would include those poems within the text proper with footnotes and that she also would include a technical bibliography on poetry as a genre inLove that Dog, although I think that later editions might indeed contain bibliographies).",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53498.Love_That_Dog,Love That Dog.txt
Life on Mars: Poems,"For 2017 I have set a goal for myself to read a minimum of twenty Pulitzer winners across all platforms. Upon hearing that Tracy K Smith had been named the United States poet laureate for the next year, I decided to read her 2012 Pulitzer winning collection Life on Mars. In poetry that is a mix of free verse, prose, letters, and songs, Smith delivers powerful words in a four part opus.Three poems stood out in this collection. The first, The Speed of Belief, pays homage to Smith's late father. Writing in alternating couplet and paragraph form, Smith's words are so deep that I felt as though I was also mourning a loved one. She writes, ""I didn't want to believe/What we believe in those rooms: That we are blessed, letting go, Letting someone, anyone;/Drag open the drapes and heave us/Back into our blinding, bright lives."" Her words grow increasingly more poignant throughout this poem as Smith balances her grief with letting go of her emotions, ending with a crescendo of the dynamic between father and daughter. I could not help but shed a tear here.Smith's title selection Life on Mars balances a plethora of emotions as she describes love, sexual violence, family dynamics, war, amongst other topics in a nine part epic. She begins with two sisters Tina and Anita as they gossip about being in love. Smith writes their section in paragraph form as she alternates between their points of view. Next she segues to describing a father's jailing of his daughter, highlighting the discrepancy between unconditional love and hatred. The poem moves to scenes in a jail and death at the hands of land mines, describing the blight of the death when people focus on hatred as opposed to love. The words here are exquisite and had me on edge, which for me as a reader does not occur too often when I read poetry; Smith's brilliancy was on full display with her centerpiece poem.Finally, They May Love All That He Has Chosen and Hate All That He Has Rejected pinpoints racial motivated killings during May, 2009. Using couplets alternating with letters, Smith first describes the hate crimes and who killed who. Then, she has the murder victims pen letters to their killers, including a heartfelt plea from a nine year old victim. All describe seeing landmarks for the first time and having unlimited capacity for love now that they are no longer confined to a body. The writing is raw, deep, and an overarching plea to stop the what seems like endless violence in this country. This poem alone merits awards and is near the end of the collection in order to leave readers feeling wowed by this special work.Tracy K Smith is deserving of her place as a poet laureate. From the small body of her work in Life on Mars, a reader only sees the tip of her exceptional work. Prior to her Pulitzer winning publication, Smith had written two other poetry collections. She has since written a memoir and has another poetry collection due out next year. If it is anything as powerful as Life on Mars, it is sure to be some of the best poetry I have written. At 5 shining stars, Tracy K Smith is one of the top authors I have read in 2017.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9639765-life-on-mars,Life on Mars Poems.txt
Sweetdark,"Sweetdark is as brilliant and carefully crafted as Brown's previous work, Graffiti and The Truth About Keeping Secrets. Sweetdark depicts the simplest pleasures of life alongside some of the largest philosophical questions: Will I ever stop being afraid of death? Is this as good as it gets? Can I live better than this?Brown’s work, alongside its subject matter, has noticeably matured from her previous collection, Graffiti, which Brown released when she was just nineteen. Sweetdark is a carefully crafted collection on the darkness of life and its promise that it will end, and the sweetness of it despite that fact. Brown’s poems detail the everyday to the out of this world, yet the strength in her writing allows us to view these settings as irrevocably intertwined.Brown’s poems detail the everyday to the out of this world, yet the strength in her writing allows us to view these settings as irrevocably intertwined. Brown forces us to consider how much we take the ordinary for granted (‘the walk home from the night / bus takes ten minutes and somehow/ I don’t appreciate a damn second’) and how it is wedded to our fear of death – this ominous impact which is heading ‘closer and closer and closer.’Brown’s evocative and palpable imagery allows us an insight into a world which is beautifully mundane yet familiar; where seeing parrots in Greenwich park or sharing drinks with a lover gives us that feeling of immortality that ‘we were here, so far from death.’ Brown’s ability to articulate such sentiments is as brilliant as it is chilling, as she effortlessly identifies the joys and horrors of being human.Sweetdark, ultimately, is interested in time and our lack of it. Brown enlightens the reader to the transience of life and her narrator’s realisation of the void, which seems intrinsically linked to her own experience. Existentialism frames each poem, taking the simplicity of shared experience to ask philosophical questions, particularly in the poem ‘void/you.’Sweetdark is as adventurous in its vivid imagery as it is in it’s diverse range of poetic form. Each poem’s structure is carefully chosen to fit each narrative. Moreover, in Sweetdark, figurative language is often interspersed with a tone of colloquialism which fits seamlessly into the poetry.Writing for a millennial and Gen-z audience, this frankness is refreshing and grounded – Sweetdark is not a collection aloft in pretentious ideals. Rather, Brown is interested in questioning the reader directly about the queries she poses, which are harder to dismiss when asked in such an understandable manner: ‘Now you know you can die. And what/ you gonna do about it, huh?’.Hence, Sweetdark’s writing style is oxymoronic in itself. Both accessible and complex, the collection allows us to live vicariously through each poem – through the highs and lows of living, through the mundane to the frightening.Brown has succeeded in writing a collection that, though deeply personal, is universally relatable. Sweetdark is a poetic triumph that holds words that will stay with you long after you finish the last page.https://www.redbrick.me/review-sweetd...",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49247951-sweetdark,Sweetdark.txt
Mending the Mind,"Originally posted on:The Quirky Book Nerd*I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review*It is difficult to find the words to describe how much I loved this poetry collection. I discovered Courtney Peppernell’s work a couple of years ago when I reviewed the first book in the Pillow Thoughts series and she quickly became one of my favorite authors. Her writing is absolutely beautiful and speaks to me on so many levels, and this collection was no different. Her poetry addresses topics that are highly relatable and always timely, which makes them very easy to connect with.You can feel all the raw emotion in every word Peppernell writes and the pure passion she puts into creating her poems. This collection is split into five parts, each one dealing with a particular theme. And as a whole, each section ties seamlessly into the next, coming together in a perfect blend that warms the heart and soul. Her poems are a series of meticulously crafted vignettes that comfort, heal, and encourage readers. With vivid imagery, Peppernell takes us on a journey that allows us to better understand, accept, and care for ourselves.One of the best parts of this collection—as well as Peppernell’s other works—is that it is written in a truly unique voice. It stands out among a sea of modern poetry dealing with similar topics and makes for a very captivating and refreshing read. The heartfelt and genuine nature of these poems is easily recognizable. They are seemingly simple but truthfully so profound and intricate. Peppernell’s words consistently empower the reader and contain a level of sincerity that turns this work into a brilliant gem of a book.On a more personal note, this collection is something that entered my life at a particularly fitting time. I have experienced a great deal of loss over the past year that has left me feeling very emotionally drained. My mind desperately needed the mending that these words do. I was touched very deeply while reading this book—it helped me to confront many thoughts I was struggling to face. This was a very cathartic and uplifting journey that filled me with the positivity that I have been lacking for a while.These poems are moving, expressive, inspiring, and utterly beautiful. I know that Peppernell’s words will stick with me for the rest of my life and I will regularly return to her collections. Works like this one are what greatly motivate me in my own writing and remind me why I am so passionate about the written word. I would love to touch one person’s life through my writing in the way she has touched mine with hers—provide someone with that bit of comfort and encouragement at a time where it is so vital. I cannot recommend this collection highly enough.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42785088-mending-the-mind,Mending the Mind.txt
Selected Poems,"4.25, rounded down. Will update with some favorite poems!Some of my favorites :“…Since a man must bringTo music what his mother spanked him forWhen he was two: bits of forgotten hate,Devotion: whether or not his mattress hurts:The little dream his father humored: the thingHis sister did for money: what he ateFor breakfast—and for dinner twenty yearsAgo last autumn: all his skipped desserts.The pasts of his ancestors lean againstHim. Crowd him. Fog out his identity.Hundreds of hungers mingle with his own,Hundreds of voices advise so dexterouslyHe quite considers his reactions his,Judges he walks most powerfully alone,That everything is—simply what it is.…”- The Sundays of Satin-Legs Smith“…Still- am I good enough to die for them, is my blood bright enough to be spilled,Was my constant back-question- are they clearOn this? Or do I intrude even now?Am I clean enough to kill for them, do they wish me to killFor them or is my place while death licks his lips and strides to themIn the galley still?(In a southern city a white man saidIndeed, I’d rather be dead;Indeed, I’d rather be shot in the headOr ridden to waste on the back of a floodThan saved by the drop of a black man’s blood.…”- Negro Hero“…2The Certainty we two shall meet by God In a wide Parlor, underneath a Light Of lights, come Sometime, is no ointment now. Because we two are worshipers of life, Being young, being masters of the long-legged stride, Gypsy arm-swing. We never did learn how To find white in the Bible. We want nights Of vague adventure, lips lax wet and warm, Bees in the stomach, sweat across the brow. Now.3Oh mother, mother, where is happiness? They took my lover’s tallness off to war, Left me lamenting. Now I cannot guess What I can use an empty heart-cup for. He won’t be coming back here any more. Some day the war will end, but, oh, I knew When he went walking grandly out that door That my sweet love would have to be untrue. Would have to be untrue. Would have to court Coquettish death, whose impudent and strange Possessive arms and beauty (of a sort) Can make a hard man hesitate—and change. And he will be the one to stammer, “Yes.” Oh mother, mother, where is happiness?…”- Appendix to the Anniad“…First fight. Then fiddle. Ply the slipping string  With feathery sorcery; muzzle the note  With hurting love; the music that they wrote  Bewitch, bewilder. Qualify to sing  Threadwise. Devise no salt, no hempen thing  For the dear instrument to bear. Devote  The bow to silks and honey. Be remote  A while from malice and from murdering,  But first to arms, to armor. Carry hate  In front of you and harmony behind.  Be deaf to music and to beauty blind.  Win war. Rise bloody, maybe not too late  For having first to civilize a space  Wherein to play your violin with grace.…Life for my child is simple, and is good.He knows his wish. Yes, but that is not all.Because I know mine too.And we both want joy of undeep and unabiding things,Like kicking over a chair or throwing blocks out of a windowOr tipping over an ice box panOr snatching down curtains or fingering an electric outletOr a journey or a friend or an illegal kiss.No. There is more to it than that.It is that he has never been afraid.Rather, he reaches out and lo the chair falls with a beautiful crash,And the blocks fall, down on the people's heads,And the water comes slooshing sloppily out across the floor.And so forth.Not that success, for him, is sure, infallible.But never has he been afraid to reach.His lesions are legion.But reaching is his rule.…”- The Womanhood“…Tomorrow. . . . Not that anybody is saying that these people have no trouble. Merely that it is trouble with a gold-flecked beautiful banner.Nobody is saying that these people do not ultimately cease to be. And Sometimes their passings are even more painful than ours. It is just that so often they live till their hair is white. They make excellent corpses, among the expensive flowers. . . .Nobody is furious. Nobody hates these people. At least, nobody driving by in this car. It is only natural, however, that it should occur to us How much more fortunate they are than we are.…”- Beverly Hill, Chicago",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/225750.Selected_Poems,Selected Poems.txt
Violet Bent Backwards Over the Grass,"I was one of the millions of people swept away by Lana Del Rey when I first heard the opening church bells and plaintive piano chords of ""Video Games"" nearly a decade ago. Despite the spite-filled hot takes and lukewarm reviews, the earworms on her debut album,Born to Die, burrowed in me. I was an immediate fan. Every new release delights me, and I sincerely count her as one of my very favorite recording artists.But this?This is bad.Very, very bad.The trouble with stan culture, though, is that diehard fans are not supposed to (nor are they encouraged to) question the output of an artist they love. Everything is perfect. To say otherwise invites the rage of fellow ""stans"". Bring onstancel culture. Buh-dum-ching.Fellow LDR Stans: this collection of ""poetry"" is bad.Very, very bad.Lana Del Rey writes song lyrics that recycle the same shopworn themes over and over again: high glamor and unfathomable wealth never conquer unshakeable sadness or fading beauty. It's melodramatic. It's a little cliché. But it's served on a bed of sumptuous choruses and captivating melodies that can distract the listener from lines like ""baby, you're so ghetto/you're looking to score"" (""Art Deco"", admittedly one of my favorite tracks of hers).I read a batshit insane review ofNorman Fucking Rockwell!when it was released that likened Del Rey's writing to that of Nobel Prize-winning Bob Dylan's. Pump the brakes, everybody. I don't evenlikeBob Dylan, but even a vague awareness of his output will dissolve any perceived similarities between his writing and hers. It's astonishing to even suggest that Del Rey is anything more than workmanlike in her writing. At her best, she is good. Just good. At her worst, she is laughably bad.Further, no writer defends why they are a writer. They justare. The sheer volume of times Del Rey refers to herself as a poet in this book is borderline satire. Methinks the lady doth protest too much.In the description on the hardcover's flap, Del Rey writes, ""...I worked laboriously picking apart each word to make the perfect poem. They are eclectic and honest and not trying to be anything other than what they are... the spirit in which they were written was very authentic.”Don’t get me started with the rage I feel whenever I hear the younger generation blather about how important it is to be your “authentic self”. I don’t know where this obsession comes from aside from the fact that social media systematically dehumanizes people so much that they don’t know how to live by their own code.Anyway. Stop using that word. You don’t need to advertise your authenticity or lack thereof. Especially you, multi-platinum, Grammy-nominated Lana Del Rey.Let's instead tackle the first sentence about “making the perfect poem” with an anecdote:Being an LDR fan, I bought both the book and the ""audiobook"" on vinyl. I thought it would be fun to listen to the record while reading the poems. So that's what I did.The audiobook itself is a curiosity. For one, the poems are presented out of order (why?) and Del Rey doesn't read every poem in the slim volume (again, why?)andeach ""track"" features producer-of-the-moment Jack Antonoff doodling around with beatnik-y guitar licks, mellotrons, and an abundant overuse of a distortion pedal. Del Rey ramrods through the poems as if she's reading them for the first time, sometimes veering into overwrought flair that sounds like some high school student's dramatic audition going off the rails.But more curiously: the poems aredifferent. Neither audiobook reading nor printed ""final"" form are alike on... well, any of them. Sometimes Del Rey eliminates an entire stanza. Sometimes it's a word, and there's no meaningful effect (tone, sound, or otherwise) for the change. On ""Paradise is Very Fragile"", ""60 years succumbed"" (print version) becomes ""80 years succumbed"" (audio version). That change hints atnothing: no deeper meaning, no added value. It merely hints that the poem is unfinished and still in its draft stages... which is what nearly every poem in this volume feels like. Unfinished or whipped up on a whim and doled out for the stans to gobble up (which, judging by the reviews on Goodreads, they have).If your poems boast perfectly picked words or “came to you in their entirety”, why change them? Because they’re not finished. Go back. Write seven or eight or forty more drafts andthenpublish your book.What's frustrating, though, is that, buried in all the meandering fluff, there is some really solid writing:""Sportscruiser"" begins with a compelling snapshot of dissolution only to tumble into literal paragraphs about Del Rey taking flying and sailing lessons. Conversations are dictated, emotions unpacked on a surface level, and actions told rather than shown. It comes across less as a poem and more as a rambling diary entry. But even within the rambling, there are some pretty lines: ""...captains aren't like poets[!!!LDRisapoet!!!];they don't make metaphors between the sea and sky"". That, to me, is a lovely line. It is surrounded by self-indulgent nonsense. Therefore, this poem is not finished.""In the flats of Melrose"" has a central stanza that presents a snapshot of domesticity with an underpinning of uncertainty. It's lovely. It's also immediately followed by an inane line about her lover becoming ""hell-bent on being some indie director"". This poem is not finished.""Violet Bent Backwards Over the Grass"" has an evocative image of a child behaving childlike in the backyard, which would've been sufficient on its own except Del Rey chooses to parallel it to the banal platitude of ""do[ing] nothing about everything forever"". Jesus. Christ.This. Poem. Is. Not. Finished.Sandwiched between the poems are ruminating photos that add some texture while also being completely meaningless. The book, therefore, is well-made and pretty but ultimately empty and far from novel. In fact, Del Rey recycles ideas from songs like ""Ride"" and ""Old Money"" and outright cribs a line from ""Cinnamon Girl"" as if her fans wouldn't notice.I’ll end on this: the hilariously bad ""Sugarfish”, which gifts us this record-scratching gem:Sugar sugar lips and teeth/fingertips touch emojis/hard forever/hearts on fleek/bb please come over.That's... just awful.Gosh, I don't know, you guys. What was I expecting? Pulitzer Prize-worthy poetry?After all, this is the same woman who wrote and sang (in deadpan, no less), ""My pussy taste like Pepsi cola.""Come at me, stans.Update: October 25, 2021Ok, y'all.Blue Banisterscame out on Friday, and I've listened to it pretty much on repeat.I have some exciting news. Lana Del Rey's lyrics are getting better: less clichéd, punchier, and often damned emotional. ""Blue Banisters"", ""Text Book"", ""Black Bathing Suit"", ""Sweet Carolina"", ""Thunder""... powerful, unexpected stuff.I'd like to say she had it in herself this entire time, but I wasn't certain. In my eyes, she's redeemed herself from this still-garbage collection.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43554866-violet-bent-backwards-over-the-grass,Violet Bent Backwards Over the Grass.txt
soft thorns,"Content warningsinclude sexual assault and anorexia.This collection of poems is divided into sections: bleed, love, scar, learn, heal. I was interested because a few of the themes interested me, especially when I learned the author has experienced chronic pain. I wanted to see how a poet would describe the experience of chronic pain but I never found out as, unless I missed something along the way, it was only mentioned inmy letter to you.I began to think this book wasn’t for me before I even read the first poem. Duringmy letter to youI foundif i hadn’t hit my proverbial rock bottom, i would not have been able to plant my roots and grow upward.Besides the lack of capitalisation, which is a huge turn off for me regardless of how incredible the writing is, I have a problem with the whole ‘rock bottom’ thing. I know it’s already reached maximum cliché level at this point but that’s not my concern. It’s the concept itself. Do we really need to fall as low as we possibly can in order to grow? Can’t we attempt to catch ourselves as we’re falling instead? Once I had my internal rant about that I moved on, hoping to be wowed by the poetry.I wasn’t and I’m really disappointed. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. Poetry is such a personal experience; what you hate I may love and vice versa. Whenever I begin any book I fully intend to adore it and word vomit to everyone who will listen to me about why they should read it and hopefully love it too. I hate it when that doesn’t happen.I want to acknowledge that this author has explored some really painful experiences in writing these poems. It takes courage and resilience to excavate these and then share them with the world. Just because I didn’t find a connection with these poems doesn’t mean you won’t.I did connect a little to some of the first group of poems but as soon as the love story and ultimate heartbreak began it was all over for me. If you’re in the midst of your own devastating breakup youmayfind these poems resonate with you but my icy heart wasn’t warmed and I certainly wasn’t keen to go looking for love after reading so much about the devastation of its demise. I think if I was going through a breakup a lot of these poems would actually make me feel worse about my situation.Some of the shorter poems read to me like sentences, not poetry. A significant amount felt like matter of fact statements. I don’t want to be able to read one poem after another without having to pause and take in the beauty of the specific combination of words I’ve just experienced. I want something revolutionary. I want to experience at least one ‘wow, I’ve never thought of it that way!’ moment.Granted I probably want too much from poetry but ultimately it boils down to wanting poetry to make mefeel. I want to feel the poet’s joy, heartache, rage, passion, hope. I want to take the experience (if not the specific words) of the poetry with me when I close the book. I read this book straight through and I hate to say it but the only thing I’m taking away from it is gratitude that I’m happily single.Thank you to NetGalley and Andrews McMeel Publishing for the opportunity to read this book. I need to research whether a book of poetry is really for me rather than getting excited and jumping straight in without doing my homework.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35288488-soft-thorns,soft thorns.txt
Swimming Lessons: Poems,"I wouldn't have read this if it hadn't been a gift. It gives me serious ""rupi kaur knockoff"" vibes, and it honestly feels like the publisher is capitalizing on trends to make a quick buck. It seems like a publicity stunt or cash grab because of the author’s acting fame, although I’m not familiar with her work—a vanity project rather than a heart project. It features all the staples of Instagram poetry:•	Teenage-journal-entry-style poems that often include the phrase “I love you” and the words “heart,” “sunset,” and “flowers”•	One sentence broken into individual lines with no variety in the form or language•	Identical platitudes about how we should live life to its fullest and about how bad breakups are hard•	Trite imagery and metaphors, like comparing heartbreak to a festering wound•	No titles, just an author signature•	Simple line illustrations (although these were drawn by someone other than the author and had all the creativity of stock images)An example:I want youin every shadethat you come in.All the goodand all the bad.And another:how can it be loveif you don’t fearthe loss of them.Swimming Lessonsshares the same emotional immaturity of Amanda Lovelace, Cyrus Parker, and yes, rupi kaur’s poetry with its Instagram aesthetic that’s easy to read but ultimately shallow. It is poetry written by and for people who have probably never read a contemporary poetry collection beyond rupi kaur, with the type of forced maturity that tries to mask the lack of depth in the poems themselves. For example, half of the unimaginative illustrations are of naked people—and I have zero problem with nudity—but I didn’t feel much sensuality in the poems themselves. There’s also a well-placed “fuck” here and there that adds to that feeling of manufactured maturity.For me, the constant expression of “I love you” in a poem (that’s not directed toward me) rings hollow because it’s become a cliché in our general expressions of love. The purpose of poetry, to some degree, is to paint the familiar in an unfamiliar light, to convey the universal in the specific. Like other young contemporary poets, the author sacrifices the personal for the universal, which makes the poems forgettable, more like inspirational wall decor you'd find at Hobby Lobby rather than individualized art. There’s an absence of specificity, of unique imagery, of profound insights that feel homegrown rather than prepackaged.The strongest sections of this collection were the descriptions of the author’s depressive episodes. Those felt the most raw and honest, and I suspect they were the ones that drew the most from her own experiences. I highlighted the poems on pages 109, 128, 154, and 155. Here’s an excerpt from one poem that talks about how we can mean to love “forever” in the moment, but we never truly mean it:You couldn’t have fathomed an endwhen you were with them,and now you can’t imagine a worldin which they’re still there.Our forevers are so fleetingthey almost mean nothingAnd here, where the author describes being transported into a captured moment of stillness in her past and reflects on how we forget so many of those small moments in life:The sound outside aligned me witha former version of myself.And I suddenly felt the gravityof my being.I might not have judged this collection so harshly if the poet had been a teenager, but the author is only a few years younger than I am. I’m sure she was well-intentioned and earnest in creating this collection, but I’m certainly not the target audience for it. I think preteen readers would relate to these poems. In fact, I can imagine my younger self sneaking this book off to my room to read it, back when sex and drinking felt more taboo, and I wanted to sample what life could be like for my ""adult"" self.Also, as a general thought: if you have to work to earn someone's love and they hesitate to love you back, that is never a positive sign. Deep, fulfilling love is reciprocal and the easiest thing in the world.Ugh, I've become a total poetry snob.

Every Word You Cannot Say,"When I was 16, I went to Kuala Lumpur for the second time in my entire life and I bought a poetry book calledI Wrote This For You: Just the WordsThe author wrote it under a pseudonympleasefindthisand for years, I had NO idea who wrote it. All I know is that I loved that poetry book so much that I would stick gossamer stickers of delicate pastel flowers all over its pages and I'd read page 107 over and over when I felt sad, letting the words wash over me. Therapy was expensive for a 16 year old but this book felt close enough to healing. It's still one of the most special books I own.And guess what? Finally, today, I found out that the poet, Iain S. Thomas who wrote this AMAZING poetry book wrote that book as well!I just couldn't contain my joy when I found out who wrote this book because it felt like a puzzle piece clicking into place.Of course, I would have loved this poetry collection, spattered with blue ink spots, emotions and tender words. Of course I should have figured out who wrote it! How could I have missed his writing style?! It is as memorable as an old friend you once loved and then moved away but the golden sound of their laughter stays. I just couldn't stop grinning because this means that Iain must be doing well enough to finally publish his poetry under his real name and I am so proud he is writing more poetry books! He deserves all the praise.This book contains longform poetry and shape poetry (words arranged inside shapes that form images). Most of the time, it doesn't even feel like poetry at all.If you dislike modern ""aesthetic"" Instagram poetry that has too many blank spaces and words so far apart, you'd be happy to know that this poetry collection is the complete opposite of that.The poems run together in long spreads, looking more like letters or small stories that talk about healing, loving, forgiving and speaking up. There are beautiful blue and red minimalist illustrations that I greatly enjoyed. There's just something about Iain's writing that makes me feel soconnected, you know? For the brief hour reading it, I felt very close to everyone else who may have read the same words ""This page is Here to tell you that it'll be OK"". It made me realize that maybe even at that moment, someone else around the world feels lonely, is hurting or crying or loving. They are Here. They are There. They are with us all when we read.The book touches on the concept of ""Here"", inviting readers to invent their own concept of ""Here"", staying grounded in the present and looking for things that matter.Reading this book is like sitting down with the poet himself, who happens to be a really good friend of yours. You sit inside your little blanket fort with him as the fairy lights flicker warmly and the rain spatters against your window sill. You are crying because you cannot imagine healing from whatever broke your heart or ripped your soul in half. But he is talking. The poet himself is whispering to you and holding you in his arms, telling you it is going to be okay and that you are strong, you are loved and it is human to cry.That's just how I felt reading this entire book. Being held, loved, seen and cherished.It's rare for me to find poetry that not only heals me but actually makes me feel like I should be kinder to others and heal them as well.I am out of words to explain how much I love this.My favourite excerpts:""I know who I am. i am the one that looks for me. And every single day, I find me again. I find myself in the things I do and the things I notice. I find myself in crowds and in solitude. I find myself in quiet moments and at the top of tall mountains. I find myself in the tips of waves, in forests, and in the books I read. I find myself in leaves and rain and old photos. Every single day, I find me again.""""Show me how you tell someone that the thought of them spreads like a warm river through your soul, until it leaves through the eyes""""I know a moment will come when I'm weak.But I'll open the onehappy moment I saved todayAnd live to see tomorrow.""",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40680983-every-word-you-cannot-say,Every Word You Cannot Say.txt

Life of the Party,"I absolutely love Olivia Gatwood and her poetry, but if I'm being honest, Life of the Party sat on my nightstand for a while. It sat there while I read other things: some for class and some for pleasure. I knew I would have to be in the right frame of mind to really get into Life of the Party. Gatwood's poetry, while excellent, is not easy. It is not gently reassuring or encouraging. Instead, it asks you tough questions and forces you to examine your fears and biases. Sometimes, you need to prepare yourself for it.""The truth is: It is a privilege to have your body looked for.""As a collection, Life of the Party is interested in one central theme: the romanticization of violence against women and what implications that romanticization has for women living in the world. Gatwood's author's note itself could be the beginning of an essay collection on this topic. She is so good at articulating her fear, her fear that is stoked by both living in a world where women are victimized and in a media landscape that is obsessed with these stories. True crime as a genre, she argues, perpetuates misogyny, racism, and sexualized violence. Women are props in these stories, usually young, beautiful, white women, who drive brave men forward to solve crimes.""Sometimes, the writer in me wants to remember just so I can give you a story.""As soon as I read this author's note, I wanted to give the collection five stars. Before I even read the poetry, I knew Gatwood understood what bugs me (and so many other women) about true crime. It is a genre that centers around women without ever focusing on them. It's a genre in which we are beaten and raped and killed, and yet that is all that is ever known about us. Also, largely, it leaves at the violence that occurs every day to women of color, sex workers, and transgender women. I have no appetite for true crime, but I do consume large amounts of Law and Order: SVU. My feelings on that are just as complicated. On one hand, it is cathartic, but also it still largely centers on sexual violence against women without really ever getting to know them.""I want to know what it means to survive something. does it just mean I get to keep my body?""The excellent author's note aside, Life of the Party is a fantastic collection. As per usual, Gatwood writes about her complicated relationships with other girls, the casual misogyny and violence she encounters when hanging out with men, and her sexual awakening as a young girl. Woven through these poems, however, is an undercurrent of murder, rape, and sexual violence. In Murder of a Little Beauty, she examines the media frenzy surrounding the JonBenet Ramsey murder. In The Boy Says He Loves Ted Bundy But Doesn't Laugh About It, she talks about the reckoning of a young man who loves Ted Bundy and realizes that maybe that means such violence is inside him too. Several poems feature Aileen Wuornos as if she's giving advice or being written to. These poems steep Gatwood's collection in the history of true crime while offering commentary on the genre.""Maybe I see myself in the worst of it. Maybe if I can imagine myself in the shallow water, you should too. Maybe I am tired of hearing people talk about the murder of girls like it is both beautiful and out of the ordinary.""And then there are the babysitter interludes. These are perhaps the strongest poems in the collection. Gatwood begins by telling a story about her babysitter growing up. We follow the story of that babysitter: how the babysitter was a talented equestrian, how her dog bit her father in the calf, how the babysitter once smashed her father's hand in the hinges of her bedroom door, how she grew rebellious and eventually turned to heroin... How it came out that she had been sexually abused by her father and no one noticed... How she died in the hospital Gatwood's mother worked at. By including this story in small interludes, we get an vision of how sexual assault and abuse can wreck someone and how they can be reacting to it without anyone being the wiser. It gives an idea of the weight girls like this carry when there is no recourse for them.""i hate telling people how it happened. there is a difference between fact & truth. the fact is that she overdosed. the truth is that he killed her.""Life of the Party is the best collection of poetry I've read this year. I would even venture to say it's the best volume of poetry published in 2019. If you're interested in feminist poetry, true crime, or any of the other topics I discussed in this review, I'd highly recommend it. And all of Gatwood's work. She is incredible. As one of my favorite comedians Jamie Loftus said in a blurb on the back of the book, ""Imagine, we get to live in the age of Olivia Gatwood.""",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43124132-life-of-the-party,Life of the Party.txt
Love Her Wild,"You and Iwill belost and founda thousand timesalong thiscobbledroad of us.When you don’t have the prowess of stringing your thoughts with rhythmic phrases, and you still dream to be called a poet, often you do what’s plausibly the most obvious alternative:Just write the sentences, and press theEnterkey in random places.You have written a prose-poem, congratulations!Just know this, pal, it’s not that easy. Don’t insult Rimbaud, he suffered enough to die young.Love isthrowing yourself into a stormy seahoping there are arms to catch youknowing that without the leapthere is only the safeand lonely shore.Ah, all that is definitely well put. But, even without sounding like a snob, I came across dozens of these stuffs whenever I misuse my spare time in social media. There are probably two things that make this one not so tedious: decent photographs that are quite in relevance, and content that isn’t at all obsequious. Exuberant yet imitative, to sum it briefly. I however came across something that did feel from the heart, in a friend’s quaint words:“And, it was wonderful for me, a woman, to be reminded that the world is also full of beautiful men who love and cherish women for the playful, complicated and stunning creatures they are. Men who would never harm a woman or take anything from her by force. Men who help women put on their coats, brush the errant hairs from their eyes, and are attentive to their protection and well-being, even in their sleep.”It certainly feels great that the quotes that so failed to impress me, managed to captivate someone as such. I have linkedJulie’s excellent review, though it may seem to be on the opposite end of the spectrum, despite being much more alluring.This book may have proved to be suitable for me, had I been someone who’s looking for some non-engaging stuff to finish his or her Goodreads goal? (I still don’t get these things…it’s not like you are going to die or something if you don’t.) I practically found it more underwhelming, for I read Anna Shtorm’sFriends Over Loversjust a few months ago, and it’s much, much better, while still being underrated. This one would have been more congenial for me if I read it on Instagram, quotes like:I want to be with someonewho dreams of doing everything in life,and nothingon a rainy Sunday afternoon.I do love to get nostalgic on those occasions, though. Maybe with some book I have had read for a zillionth time.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33208115-love-her-wild,Love Her Wild.txt
Lord of the Butterflies,"4/9/19I'm going to go see Andrea live tonight and I'm kinda sorta maybe absofuckinglutely beside myself with glee.This is my glee face 😃Now you know.__________________________________Andrea Gibson introduced me to the power of poetry.I thought verse was all flowers and love and a bunch of other crap that, not only could I not relate to, I also couldn't give one single solitary f#ck about.YouTube is where my love affair with Andrea began. After inadvertently coming across a spoken word video (I was most likely watching pimple popping videos at the time) my view on poetry changed.I changed.I became educated on the LGBTQ community in a way that was relatable and tangible. I had gay friends, isn't that what every heterosexual person says? I realized they weren't really friends because I didn't know them as intimately as I did my straight friends. I naively thought I knew the life that they had and continued to endure because I watched that one movie that one time that had a gay guy in it. I watched Queer Eye and The L Word and considered myself enlightened.My level of ignorance was shameful at best.After devouring every video I could find, I then ordered the book The Madness Vase. My very first poetry purchase.Next, I drove four hours to go and witness these words that I had fallen in love with spoken by their architect.Words had never had such an effect on me before that live spoken word performance. I was gutted and resuscitated, my heart injured and then revived. I was a mass of emotions and then I realized I was crying. Out of embarrassment, I glanced around to see if anybody was looking at me only to discover that the entire audience was in tears.I'm going to see my second live performance by Andrea on April 9, 2019. I'm bringing tissues this time.This new book is beyond words, it is simply something that you must experience for yourself. It is now available in paper and ebook form.As someone that has suffered with panic disorder for 23 years, ODE TO THE PUBLIC PANIC ATTACK resounds with me on a level I never thought possible, giving me words to describe the indescribable._________________________________________________A very small excerpt fromODE TO THE PUBLIC PANIC ATTACKIf you've never had a panic attack,there's a good chance that you'vebeen an ass to someone who has.JUST RELAXand CALM DOWNalways seem like helpful thingsto scream if oxygenhas never been over your head,if your body has never been it's own corset.______________________________________________Thank you, Andrea, for sharing your words with the world and for being you.I received an ARC from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39656141-lord-of-the-butterflies,Lord of the Butterflies.txt
The Strength In Our Scars,"“I am a firm believer in there being beauty in the contrast. In the light and the dark days. In the hope and the hurt. In the fire and in the ash. I am a firm believer in the fall and in the rise; in the sin and in the saving. I am a firm believer in the broken, the people who hold their pieces together with belief, who bandage their fear in faith. I am a firm believer in the souls who have always managed to protect their soft; who have always known, even when it ached the most, that their wounds were healing them, that the hardest parts of life were growing them from the inside. I am a firm believer in there being beauty in the contrast—you have not lived until you have died.”This was such a lovely read.I docked one star, because I found some pieces to be a bit contradicting (but that's what life is, I suppose). I wish I could list all my favourite pieces here, but there were no titles (which I actually found refreshing).Side note: I would like to point out that this is not poetry, but prose. It reads a bit like a philosophical self-help book.“It is all I have lostthat has set me free.”“These places, they are not where you were born, but they will be where you are reborn.”",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41057388-the-strength-in-our-scars,The Strength In Our Scars.txt
Black Book of Poems,"‘If only I had a brilliant mind I’d waste away my days, for days As of this day, I am at waste, And still I lack a brilliant mind.’Armenian born author Vincent Hunanyan earned his degree in creative writing from UCLA. He now lives and writes in Stockholm.It is refreshing when a new poet offers an explanatory note about his art before the poems begin - from his stance we are more tied to his mission: ‘I believe that good poetry resonates with people on a metaphysical level; you can read a poem without quite being able to put into words why you enjoyed it. It could have been the shivers that ran down your spine or the elevating of your heartbeat. Or, it made you smile, or even cry; made you feel something. A key component of good poetry is honesty; much of the poetry in the world doesn’t speak to people because it is forced and pretentious. If what you write is true and honest, and you put some actual effort into it, I believe people will respond to it. I write only that which I know, that which I can feel and try to transcend to the reader through a few lines. Nothing else concerns me. I think that most people don’t read or appreciate poetry because they have been exposed to too much poor poetry, and been told by their professors to interpret them in a certain way, like there is a science to interpreting a poem. There isn’t; poetry, just like any other piece of artistic creation, is subjective. You cannot ruin someone's interpretation of a poem by explaining it. But if the poem doesn't speak for itself, ultimately, it is a failure.’A few examples of this impressive new poet follow:Romeo’s ElegyTo broken hearts, to broken dreamsTo me and you, to you and meTo all the friends and all the foes,To those who love and those who don'tTo those who have and those withoutTo parent's scorn, deprived of doubtTo those who give, to those who saveTo those afraid, and all the braveTo all the seconds, unforgivingTo the departed and all the livingTo those who dare, to those who careTo those in bliss and in despairTo all the smiles and all the laughs,To all we love, on love's behalfTo all the pain and single cryTo happiness and every high!City NightsIn solitude in bed I lieAnd all the while the sirens cryA homeless bastard passes byThe smell of urine rises highAnd hides away, above the skyForsaken dogs bark in the parkFireworks in distance sparkAnd I wake up, and still it’s dark.Sensitive, probing and holding thoughts that speak to each of us in our own needs, Vincent has succeeded in his first publication that his is a voice worthy of our following.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35431074-black-book-of-poems,Black Book of Poems.txt
The Dark Between Stars,"I’m probably going to be in the minority here but here goes… 3.5 overhyped stars rounded down to 3.She was thatwild thing I lovedmy dark between starsI absolutely loved Love Her Wild, Atticus’s first book. The poems were separated into sections (Love, Her, and Wild) and the poems were placed accordingly. Atticus attempted a similar set up for The Dark Between Stars with varying degrees of success. He started backward with Stars and ended with Dark, which was an interesting choice. In the book’s description it mentioned that themes range from falling in love, being committed, to accepting the nostalgia of being alone again so it makes sense to start with Stars. However, my overwhelming thought throughout the entire book was how disjointed it felt. I had to actively focus on the section to remind myself what exactly I was supposed to be focusing on.Also, one on my favorite things about Love Her Wild was that the vast majority of the poems were very short but very meaningful. I felt that there were many unnecessarily long poems that seemed almost rambling. These poems had an effect on the pacing, which was kind of off-putting.It felt like some parts were more motivational poster than poetry;The truth issometimesyou canbothdo better.Pretty sure I’ve heard this sentiment word for word by no less than 4 people.Despite its shortcomings, I still enjoyed this collection of poems very much. The poems I did like, I loved. And the use of pictures throughout gave a good sense of feelings of wonder and nostalgia to go along with the main themes.Maybe if I didn’t read through the entire thing all in one sitting I might have a different view of the coherency and pacing.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38926444-the-dark-between-stars,The Dark Between Stars.txt
"Born to Love, Cursed to Feel","I received this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.I read about 50% and then decided to give this up.Let's talk about the cover and title first. The cover is shady and intriguing, and the tile clearly depicts what the book is meant to be. It is a clear portrayal of the content of the book and it definitely goes along with the cover. It was, in fact, the cover which got me interested in this book.Now for the actual content.Born to Love, Cursed to Feelis a poetry collection by authorSamantha Kingfilled with poems aboutlove, loss, redemption, regret, moving on, etc.Initially, when I started the book, I thought it wasbeautiful. I really enjoyed the poems, and I thought that the writing was mdoern and lovely. The poems were touching, they were well-written and I could even relate to a couple of them.However, then, why did I DNF it? FRom about 40% of the book onwards,it all became tiring.Almost all of the poems I readwere written in the same vein, same tone, and were about the same damn thing. They were all about how this girl has lost her love, and how she's hurting and trying to move on and how this break-up destroyed her. And I found that as the pages kept turning and I went further into the book, I kept disliking it more and more. After a while, it was just the same old things written in new words.I like reading about loss and sad break-ups,but not so much that it becomes depressing and annoying.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30312512-born-to-love-cursed-to-feel,"Born to Love, Cursed to Feel.txt"
Dear Midnight,"Though a lot of pages were starred and a lot of poems were marked I still feel like there was even more poetry in that laid flat for me. But, the ones I liked I really liked! Let's talk about them a little bit... There are shape poems in the beginning! I didn't expect that at all, and as someone whose very intrigued by that particular style of poetry I found this very pleasing to begin our story with. Pages 14 and 16 were my favorites. As for the ones I didn't note, they weren't bad poems I just didn't think the additional spacing and extended text added to the power of the poems.Next, let's talk about how the book is actually set up. It's in three sections: Sunrise, Sunset, and Midnight. First off this is nice distinction to begin with. Secondly, the sections are color coordinated. Let me explain, Sunrise starts like most books: white pages and black ink. Sunsets pages are greyed down some, with the the same black ink- this on is rather fitting because dusk is often the time of day when it's harder to see not quite sure entirely bright or dark. Midnights pages then are introverted; The r pages are black and the text is white. The words in Midnight stick out in the darkness like the full moon would in the sky. Additionally, the mood is different at each of those times in the day, at least that's what I feel between them. But, also, it's appealing to both your morning birds and your night owls and I think depending on which of those you really relate to more will influence which section you gravitate towards more. For me, it was midnight.Some of my favorite midnight pieces included pages: 60 (I love the line ""We are a generation of almost lovers""), 64, 66/67*, 69/70, 78, 82, & 83.*Its a table of contents poem! Which are always fun. This one in particular tells you the story of this actual book- so I'm glad it didn't happen in the beginning because it would have given away the entire book and its ending before we even got started. Of course, because this was such an exact table of contents to our bigger story I also found it a little repetitive. So that ones a bit of a 50/50 for me if we really talk about it.Okay, just one more thing I want to talk about. There is one particular poem that is featured in each section of the day (pages 31, 49, and 62). This is particularly fun because the poem keeps changing. In the morning you have the poem as it is, how it started. Then during the evening it becomes a black out poem, changing the meaning. At Midnight the word regret is Italicized and that one slight change makes all the difference. Separate the poems are good, but together in a sequence/series broken up by the very time of the day makes them all the more powerful.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43824575-dear-midnight,Dear Midnight.txt

Healing the Heart,"Originally posted on:The Quirky Book Nerd*I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review*I read this a few months ago, as soon as I could get my hands on a copy, and I am still at a loss for words when it comes to describing this work. I’ll start by saying that the message of “healing the heart” rang so true all throughout these pages. It entered my life at the best possible moment—as I have been going through the mending of my own heart—and touched me incredibly deeply. She has a talent for crafting poems that are seemingly unassuming and straightforward, but that are, in actuality, extremely complex, vivid, and multi-dimensional. And the beauty of her writing lights up every line.Each section of this collection focuses on a different type of healing, and makes for the perfect book to pick up either when in need of overall healing and positivity, or when going through a specific healing process. The range of emotion shown in these poems hits its mark time and time again, and makes this a widely accessible piece. Peppernell’s words seamlessly fill one’s soul with the comfort it is craving, as well as the healing you didn’t even know you were in need of. There is such safety and peace within these pages, a reader’s sanctuary where one can comfortably grieve and find release.On a brief, more personal note, I discovered Courtney Peppernell’s work about a year ago and she immediately flew to the top of my favorite poets list. The messages, values, and general positivity that she puts out to the world through her words has been exceedingly impactful for me, and I truly admire her—she is an absolutely beautiful person. I want to have the strength to fully acknowledge and express who I am one day, and it is people like Courtney that, without knowing it, give me more courage. She has a way of always inspiring me both in my writing and in accepting and striving to be my true self—and this is a gift that is meaningful beyond words.And since I honestly cannot rave enough about her work, I very highly encourage you to check out this collection, as well as Courtney’s previous poetry collections.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38507175-healing-the-heart,Healing the Heart.txt
For The Broken,"""Your brokenness is beautiful not because of the way you are but because of the way you will be when you are finally free.""This past few weeks I´m in a place where I can´t seem to read anything.I tried different types of romance, different genres.. I tried to re-read my favourite books of the year, but it seems like nothing really goes through me anymore.So I tried to read poetry, and since ""For the Broken"" was avaiable on Kindle Unlimited, I decided to give it a shot.At first I really thought this book was about people who were heartbroken, that just got out of a relationship or of a crush that went wrong, and this poem would help them heal and realize that we can stay broken for quite some time, but surely this time is not going to be forever.But, in reality, something that I didn´t realized is that people who are broken are not broken just because of a relationship that went wrong or rejection.People sometimes are broken because society made them feel that way.People sometimes are broken because they can´t seem to fit in any place that they go.People sometimes are broken because the equality that everyone talks about is not there at all.""Losing what matters most to you is the beginning of becoming yourself.""So, even though I thought a lot of times during my reading that this book was a cheap self-helping kind of thing, it made me realize that brokeness could come in all forms and types. And, even though we think that we can´t seem to move on and this pain is never going to cease, we all have to hope that someday everything is going to be all right and there´s no one but ourselves that are responsible for the hope in our lives that someday we won´t stay broken anymore.""It´s hard to heal when your mind has moved on but your heart is stuck in the past.""",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35784849-for-the-broken,For The Broken.txt
in the absence of the sun,"If I’ve said it once, I’ve said it a thousand times: I just don’t think modern poetry is my thing.2/5 stars.If this type of poetry hits you right in the stomach, awesome! That’s great. I’m truly happy for you. But what happened to the poetry that was so saturated in beautifully strung together metaphors that it was practically dripping off the page? I miss those days. I miss that poetry. If this works for you, that’s wonderful. To each his/her own. Personally I found this entirely underwhelming and I had to force myself to push through this collection. It seems so utterly juvenile, but even middle school me would probably have read these poems and thought they were missing substance and clarity. Once I finish my stack of recently ordered Amazon poetry, I do not think I will be revisiting any modern day poets for awhile. It obviously isn’t for me, and I loathe writing bad reviews. I’m giving this 2/5 stars because frankly I don’t want to give any poet a one star rating. I don’t want writers to feel discouraged to write from the heart, which is exactly what poetry is - it’s a pressure-release valve, a blurry photograph of the soul, a more socially-accepted anti-anxiety medication.

I Am More Than a Daydream,"Reading through this very short collection, I am still amazed that poets have this ability to incite an emotion, or connect you so easily, with just a mere two or three sentences.Actually, let that sink in for a moment. A novelist can build you a fantastical world, and make you believe in these magical characters and creatures, and take you away on these grand adventures......but it's done within the length of an entire book. Fifty THOUSAND or MORE words.Jennae Cecelia, in her short bursts of anger,of pain,of curiousity,of empowerment,of embracing,of beauty, and self worth.She said it with very few words. Cecelia didn't need to build us a world where women felt fear and pressured. We have our society to thank for that. Instead she took our story - mine and yours - of heartache, of comparisons and standards of beauty, and used what we women know about those feelings of self worth, and gave us back more than our reflections on a looking glass. If eyes are the windows to our soul, and we barely make eye contact with everyone nowadays... than what are our reflections say about us tell only half of what we've been through. Peer closer. Really look at someone in the eye. There is always more to their story. But we get caught up in the physicality that we forget there's a person beneath all that falsehood, or bravada. We forget that in our own ways, EVERYONE is just trying to fit in and wanting to be loved, and accepted.She tells us in so many words that we matter. Within these pages, I am known. I felt seen and embolden in my approach to life and beauty. Though I already know I am more than a daydream. My hope is that you'll believe it too.....Cheers, sisters!***I received this book in exchange for an honest review. I am not required to write a positive one.

Bright Minds Empty Souls,"Blog|Twitter|Instagram| Review also posted atBooked J.|""It is a blessing and a curse to remember everything.""For those of you who have been following me for a while, you may have noticed that I have a massive appreciation for poets who bring us into their lives by simple prose. It never matters how little or much they pen; there's just a spark of life within their words and it's kind of fearless to let countless readers into your most intimate thoughts.Jennae Cecelia has a voice that shines through in her works andBright Minds Empty Soulsis proof of that. The quality of her writing is minimal in a way that swiftly gets down to the point. Expressing yourself is what poetry is all about, and Jennae Cecelia brings her thoughts to page beautifully. Further, her work feels a lot like she is talking directly to her audience. This makes it easy to connect with.What I loved most aboutBright Minds Empty Soulsis that it ties up pieces of her life throughout a period of time. Each poem was written separately and the collection was put together in the end to create the finished product. There's a significance to the collection that I can't explain unless you read it, then, chances are, you would feel it too. When you consider the fact that it took Jennae 6 years to complete this collection, it makes sense--it's crafted out of love.Other things to note:Jennae Cecelia always makes you feel present throughout her works. I already said this, but I have to say it again: each collection feels truly like a conversation between the two of you or even just a glimpse into her mind. There's so much to relate to inBright Minds Empty Souls, as with any other title she's published in the past, and it serves as a great inspiration.Ultimately, poetry is meant to be thought provoking and raw. Real and expressive. Life at its best and worst.Bright Minds Empty Soulscaptures more than a few emotions and will, without a doubt, make readers feel. Jennae Cecelia proves once more than she is an underrated talent and will only continue to grow as a writer in what will sure to be a long career.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30038016-bright-minds-empty-souls,Bright Minds Empty Souls.txt
The Day Is Ready for You,"The Day is Ready for You starts off really strong with the first quarter of the book comprising of some of Malee’s better poems. As the collection carried on though it started venturing into the type of one line inspirational poetry that feels like greeting card sentiments, something common it seems with many instapoets. Short, simple, easily digestible, not all that heavy hitting or memorable. The book dragged to me during the middle of the book, I think many of these poems could’ve used better editing or been excluded altogether.Malee covers several themes: love, heartbreak, motherhood, depression, and self-acceptance among others. Name You is a particularly sweet poem about motherhood that touched my heart. The handful of stand-out poems in the collection was relatable and honest, so I did have to give Malee some credit.I think that the author definitely has the potential to be a wonderful poet, though at the moment her work is very similar to many other instapoets – too simple with flowery language that doesn’t mean anything. There are times that a poem will read nicely, a story told through metaphor, but then the final line will repeat the previous statements in a blunt way that to me felt unnecessary. A good poem can stand on its own without needing to explain itself to the reader.Her work could use a little more development and that’s fine for a new author finding her footing. This book was really a middle-of-the-road read for me. I didn’t dislike it, but I didn’t love it either. I think it could be great for folks that enjoy poets such as Rupi Kaur and Amanda Lovelace.Disclaimer:Received a copy for review from the publisher via NetGalley",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36374392-the-day-is-ready-for-you,The Day Is Ready for You.txt
The Collected Poems,"Sylvia Plath was an American poet, novelist, and short story writer, widely regarded as one of the most influential and emotionally powerful authors of the 20th century. Born in Boston, Massachusetts, she demonstrated literary talent from an early age, publishing her first poem at the age of eight. Her early life was shaped by the death of her father,Otto Plath, when she was eight years old, a trauma that would profoundly influence her later work.Plath attended Smith College, where she excelled academically but also struggled privately with depression. In 1953, she survived a suicide attempt, an experience she later fictionalized in her semi-autobiographical novel The Bell Jar. After recovering, she earned a Fulbright Scholarship to study at Newnham College, Cambridge, in England. While there, she met and married English poetTed Hughesin 1956. Their relationship was passionate but tumultuous, with tensions exacerbated by personal differences and Hughes's infidelities.Throughout her life, Plath sought to balance her ambitions as a writer with the demands of marriage and motherhood. She had two children with Hughes, Frieda and Nicholas, and continued to write prolifically. In 1960, her first poetry collection, The Colossus and Other Poems, was published in the United Kingdom. Although it received modest critical attention at the time, it laid the foundation for her distinctive voice—intensely personal, often exploring themes of death, rebirth, and female identity.Plath's marriage unraveled in 1962, leading to a period of intense emotional turmoil but also extraordinary creative output. Living with her two children in London, she wrote many of the poems that would posthumously form Ariel, the collection that would cement her literary legacy. These works, filled with striking imagery and raw emotional force, displayed her ability to turn personal suffering into powerful art. Poems like ""Daddy"" and ""Lady Lazarus"" remain among her most famous, celebrated for their fierce honesty and technical brilliance.In early 1963, following a deepening depression, Plath died by suicide at the age of 30. Her death shocked the literary world and sparked a lasting fascination with her life and work. The posthumous publication of Ariel in 1965, edited by Hughes, introduced Plath's later poetry to a wide audience and established her as a major figure in modern literature. Her novel The Bell Jar was also published under her own name shortly after her death, having initially appeared under the pseudonym ""Victoria Lucas.""Plath’s work is often classified within the genre of confessional poetry, a style that emphasizes personal and psychological experiences. Her fearless exploration of themes like mental illness, female oppression, and death has resonated with generations of readers and scholars. Over time, Plath has become a feminist icon, though her legacy is complex and occasionally controversial, especially in light of debates over Hughes's role in managing her literary estate and personal history.Today, Sylvia Plath is remembered not only for her tragic personal story but also for her immense contributions to American and English literature. Her work continues to inspire writers, artists, and readers worldwide. Collections such as Ariel, Crossing the Water, and Winter Trees, as well as her journals and letters, offer deep insight into her creative mind. Sylvia Plath’s voice, marked by its intensity and emotional clarity, remains one of the most haunting and enduring in modern literature.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2078076.The_Collected_Poems,The Collected Poems.txt
Stuff I've Been Feeling Lately,"Free copy provided by Netgalley in return for an honest reviewPublication date:11th April 2017Review date:27th March 2017I’ve always been a lover of poetry, so when I went thought the “Read Now” section in the poetry genre on Netgalley and foundStuff I’ve Been Feeling Lately, I just had to grab it to read. The cover itself is well produced and it made me wonder what the book could possibly be about. Turns out, the whole book is designed as a mix tape of feelings, and is something that is heavily unique, to my knowledge. I loved this about the book, and it made me all the more determined to read it.I don’t know what I was expecting from this book, in all honesty. It seemed to be a generic ‘I’ve been feeling sad and this is what I’m feeling’ sort of book. I am so glad to say that I was taken by surprise by the amount of flexibility in this collection. We have the poems that scream, I am depressed and I don’t know what to do about it but we also have the poems that scream for recovery, of dragging yourself out of the depths of despair and fixing yourself. Not only do we have the duality of these beautiful poems, but we also have the duality of heartbroken to revival of a broken heart.Cook has created a whole world of pain and recovery in just two hundred and forty two pages.Side A is a set of 100 poems of what Cook has been feeling as she wrote this book. Pain, heartache, despair. Warmth, love, recovery. Each poem I found I could relate to those, and those that I couldn’t relate to reminded me of hope, and how the world will continue on after the pain I am currently going through. Nothing is permanent, no matter how long these things seem to go on for, is something my mother has said to me many times over the past seven years, and Cook has embodied this beautiful advice my mother gave me countless time before. Side A has taught me that, my mother is right. This pain may seem to go on and on forever, and it may seem unbearable; Cook’s writing has taught me that it will be alright, one day, no matter how far away that it. There is always sun after a storm, and recovery after a broken heart. There will always be something to wake up for, even if it’s just the bark of a dog, or the call of a friend.Side B is black out poetry of the poems within Side A, and others (I believe) not published in this collection. They are art, creating new poems with hope in poems originally about despair. I connected with these poems so well and it made my heart bleed. These were absolutely stunning and have taken my breath away. I can’t put into words just how much these all mean to me.Cook has created a mass of poems, all of which can be related to my life, and have brought me back to reality. They have gone through so many problems that I am currently going through and they have opened my eyes to realise that I can recover. Cook’s writing is absolutely beautiful and fluid, and it is so so easy to follow.I highly recommend this to any poetry fan.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29059581-stuff-i-ve-been-feeling-lately,Stuff I've Been Feeling Lately.txt
Lullabies (Volume 2),"HAPPY POETRY MONTH!april is national poetry month,so here come thirty floats!the cynics here will call this plana shameless grab for votes.and maybe there’s some truth to that—i do love validation,but charitably consider ita rhyme-y celebration.i don’t intend to flood your feed—i’ll just post one a day.endure four weeks of rerunsand then it will be may!**************************okay, i have finally reviewed this. it has been sitting in my windowsill-stack of ""books i gotta review"" long enough, and i just can't look at it anymore. as little as i wanted to revisit it, i feel anxious when i have placeholders or blank spaces in the review field, so here goes nothing.i give every author three chances to impress me. you know the old saying: fool me once - shame on you. fool me twice, shame on me. fool me three times - it's back on you.and sometimes it pans out - hermann hesse had a great last-minute save withDemianafter failing to wow me with eitherSiddharthaorNarcissus and Goldmund. jane austen, i am sorry to say, got her three shots and none of them made me see what all the fuss was about.this one… well, this one's on me.that is a picture of the folded-over pages in my copy of this book, each one representing a poem in this collection that i found problematic in some way: sloppy rhyme/meter/rhythm, misused words, superficial abstractions, vague intention masked by ""pretty"" conceits, and just general ""offness."" no one has the time or inclination to go through the whole book with a red pen, but i'll refer to some specific examples in this review, lest anyone think my negativity is some knee-jerk bitterness over the nonsense that happened on my thread forlove and misadventureand then continued to escalate outside of goodreads in situations that were very character-revealing.remember, hikers, sometimes nature will put its poison in a pretty, pretty flower.when you write a book and it becomes popular, you have two choices as a writer: you can either stick with what has already proven successful and continue in the same vein, or you can take a risk; evolve as a writer, and deliver something that shows you have range beyond your first time out. there are risks and rewards no matter which way you choose: taking risks can sometimes end in failure, losing the fans who liked your early stuff, but maybe gaining the respect of discriminating readers who appreciate risk. staying the same might satisfy your already established fans, but people who didn't like the first book aren't going to like the second book.this book is not taking any risks, and is exactly the same kind of singsongy pap as the first book, and there are even six poems fromLove & Misadventurereprinted at the end. in case you wanted to revisit them.it's another collection about love and obsession and regret and breakup woe and the joy of defining yourself in terms of another person's feelings for you. there's no growth in the writing; both the subject matter and the way it is expressed are extremely infantile.although this time, she's all growed up and gettin' racy and in one of her prose pieces, after some pillow-talk lover's fantasy about stealing a book from a bookstore, which is already douchey enough, the piece ends like so:Then do you know what I'd do?What - would - you -do? she says between peals of laughter.I'd take you out,fuckyou up against the car.stay classy, lang leav!it's revealing to me that most of the glowing reviews of lang leav's books on here have expressed some variation of ""this is my first poetry book"" or ""i never liked poetry before this."" and that's great - it's always encouraging to see people enthusiastic about books, regardless of what the book actually is - every reader their book and yadda. and i understand that language is a constantly evolving creature - the word ""tragedy"" has become less-specific than its original meaning in colloquial usage, while ""decimate"" has broadened in scope and words like ""literally"" and ""epic"" have had their meanings obliterated completely and semantic bleaching morphs words all the time. but ""poetry,"" too?? has poetry become ""anything written in choppy little line breaks?"" i'm not even a huge fan of poetry, but i know that it's more than just words scattered on a page. and don't give me that ""free verse"" nonsense. because even free verse has rules. and here are some of them:Free Verse is poetry that is based on the irregular rhythmic cadence recurring, with variations of phrases, images, and syntactical patterns rather than the conventional use of meter. In other words, free verse has no rhythm scheme or pattern. However, much poetic language and devices are found in free verse.Rhyme may or may not be used in free verse, but, when rhyme is used, it is used with great freedom. In other words, free verse has no rhyme scheme or pattern.Free verse does not mean rhyme cannot be used, only that it must be used without any pattern.so, for example, a poem like this:cannot be deemed ""free verse"" because there is anattemptat patterned rhyme, it's just poorly done. if you're going to make the effort to rhyme, follow through and be consistent. otherwise, the reader will find the hiccup grating and it just ruins any emotional connection you may have had to the poem because you are taken out of the moment and you have to start over and see what the hell happened. if you're going to choose to be rhyme-y - BE RHYME-Y - you can't go rogue in the middle or the end of a poem. find a way to make it work or abandon the idea of rhyme scheme altogether if it's clipping your wings, because honestly - greeting card rhyme patterns do not a sophisticated poem make, and i don't understand her commitment to this style when she can't even seem to do it correctly half of the time.this one, okay, this one IS free verse - hooray.but here, leaving aside the jejeune sentiment and the tra la la of it, which may be appealing to some readers, there's a structural problem here in the scansion; the way the reader is led along by the nose in a consistent cadence and meter until that off-putting stumble over the finish line. it's terrible execution and shows complete disregard for the reader.and this is something that occurs frequently throughout this collection - one lazy rhyme in the middle of a poem that otherwise has a very rigid rhyme scheme which throws the whole thing off. or one dissonant rhythm break that makes you wince.it's not just the rhyme scheme and scansion - there's also just plain lousy editing.this is the second poem in the book. ""i would not nearly had so much"" is not the way you want to introduce a collection.but wait, there's more!this book also contains a number of prose pieces, many of which are trying so hard to be clever and conceptual through the conceit of personifying abstractions (Patience and Love agreed to meet at a set time and place; beneath the twenty-third tree in the olive orchard), but they're so forced and artless. capitalizing a word does not automatically make it meaningful. you gotta supply the meaning with the other words.There was a girl named Despondency, who loved a boy named Altruistic, and he loved her in return.for grammatical/semantic balance, shouldn't that be ""altruism""? or ""despondent?"" noun/noun or adjective/adjective? this is what is so frustrating - it's all surface-pretty, but utterly thoughtless. you can be as surprising or poetic as you like, but there should also be lyrical elegance. there's no sense that any effort went into the writing of these, no going back and rereading to make sure these words work together. it's all churn with no meaning.and jesus, this:that is the complete poem. and it's a mess. analogies are meant to be gracefully balanced comparisons of the relationships between disparate things. (hot is to cold as fire is to ice) but this one is ass-backwards, as anyone studying for the sats could tell you. i assume she's riffing off the adage that ""time heals all wounds."" and she's aware that a suture is used to close a wound, which is a literal comparison to the metaphorical healing that time performs. but in the syntax she's using here, she's basically saying that ""wounds heal all sutures."" which is incorrect. and i'm sure she thought it sounded pretty and was so darn proud of her rhyme she thought no one would notice how sloppy and illogical it was. but i certainly did.these instances of ""i am making pretty words say things that sound kinda smart and poetical"" but make no sense occur frequently, likeSometimes when I read a book, parts will lift from the pages in an anagram of your name. Like a code to remind me it's not over. Like dyslexia in reverse, which makes my head hurt too much to even begin to parse.and it goes on and on - incomplete thoughts, missing words, elisions:how they easily WHAT?what is the ""it"" here; the reason for their being? does this refer to ""time is told by seeing?"" so - ""time is told by seeing"" is the reason for the existence of clocks? what the shit does that mean and why did this insight necessitate a poem?leaving aside the fact that a circle IS a line, are we supposed to fill in the blanks ourselves? ""towards"" is a preposition and requires a noun or a pronoun to complete the thought, which i assume in this case is ""you,"" but again - really sloppy syntax. and this is what is so galling and made me so furious reading this collection - the sacrifice of meaning for the sake of rhythm in some instances, while so frequently being cavalier about maintaining consistent rhythm in others.more slipshod scansion, more jacked-up sentence structure. to compete with? to compete for? to compete in? finish your thought.and i know that some people love these poems because OMG the feels. and maybe this is a generational thing or a byproduct of people who get book deals based on their internet popularity where there is less editorial oversight, and maybe my complaints about this put me in the same category as people who complain about the infantilization of america with its grown men in baseball caps and those kids and their video games and how all the pop stars are under the drinking age and that's not music why in my day and get off my lawn. but maybe it's just disgust at the fact that people are willingly shelling out seventeen dollars for a hundred or so carelessly-written poems, many of which do not exceed eight lines, and it's the poetic equivalent of nursery food.and that is what i thought of this book.and i know i'm gonna have all these people come out and tell me how much they liked this book and how it changed their life and how wrong i am for scrutinizing it because poetry is like rainbows and it is immune to judgment. and yay for you if you liked this and it had value for you, sincerely. but opinions and an asshole - i have both. and even my asshole thought this collection was unsophisticated and sloppy.*************************************************2014:pulitzer prize nominee maya angelou, in the year of her death, writes a poem commemorating the life of nobel peace prize recipient nelson mandela, (who died in december 2013, but that's pretty much 2014), and we honor their lives by allowing this to win the 2014 goodreads best poetry award?:StayThe words I heardfrom you today,are said whenthere's nothingleft to say.What I would giveto make you stay,I would give itall away.i was hoping i wouldn't have to read this, but goodreads voters have forced my hand.i'll let you know if it's any good.come to my blog!",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22151696-lullabies-volume-2,Lullabies (Volume 2).txt
Odder,"I live in Morro Bay, CA. In our Bay are otters. A lot of visitors come here to see the otters. While my family was visiting this summer, they couldn’t wait to see the otters. For my daughter-in-law’s birthday this summer, we got her a cozy chair blanket with an otter picture on it. She lit up! There is something about an otter!This is an enjoyable story that animal lovers will appreciate.But…it is also an educational experience, too.Odder is written in free verse and inspired by true events, according to the author’s note at the back of the book. It also has lovely illustrations throughout by Charles Santoso that add to the story.Premise: Otter pup Odder is separated from her mom after a fierce storm. Fortunately, strange animals – humans – discover her and take her to a strange place, and restore her health. Eventually she goes back to the wild, has fun, makes friends – but after being badly injured by a shark bite, lands back with the humans again to be given a wonderful job of nurturing and raising other pups at the Monterey Bay Aquarium.There is much to love about the story – the feelings of adventure and impulsivity of the otters. The natural movements of a shark. The ways of the bay/ocean. The wonderful human intentions (to keep the otters healthy and/or happy in the wild). The importance of play. Messages of resilience, compassion and empathy.Some trigger moments for discussion with kids…Since the story is about orphaned pups and told from the viewpoint of one of them, (Odder) there will be some violence and scariness. A sense of fear, grief and uncertainty of being permanently separated from Mom is essential to the story – which may be difficult for kids to understand, even while kind humans provide a safety net.Other difficult parts to discuss with kids may involve when Odder is attacked by a shark and can no longer be in the wild, and another otter delivers a stillborn pup.Yet, even though…The story will have moments when it is centered on grief, loss and separation as pups lose their moms, moms lose their pups and friends lose each other – there will also, be in the background, a dedicated, caring group of scientists and volunteers working hard at keeping them safe.I strongly recommend that when readers are finished with the story, they read the Author’s note, to learn the amazing fictional backstories of these animals and their caretakers at the Monterey Bay Aquarium in Monterey, CA.She is also the author of The One and Only Ivan.

Inside Out & Back Again,"Thinking about the most memorable of children's novels, one trait in all of them has to ring true in order for them to click with their readers. The books must contain some kind of ""meaning"". Even the frothiestCharlie and the Chocolate Factory-type offering isn't going to remain long in the public's brain if there isn't at least a little ""meaning"" slipped in there. Now when I use the term ""meaning"" I'm being purposefully vague because it's not the kind of thing you can easily define. What is meaningful to one person might strike another as trite or overdone. I personally believe that adult novels contain this saccharine faux-meaning a lot more often than their juvenile contemporaries, and why not? Adult books can get away with it while children's books are read by the harshest of all possible critics: children. As a librarian and a reviewer, I'm pretty tough too. I get mighty suspicious of prose that gets a little too lyrical or characters that spout the book's thinly disguised premise on every other page. All this is leading up to the fact that when I turned my jaded suspicion-filled toxic eyeballs on Thanhha Lai'sInside Out and Back AgainI found nothing to displease me. Lai's debut novel speaks with a natural voice that's able to make salient points and emotional scenes without descending into overly sentimental goo. This author makes a point to draw from her own life. The result is a novel that works in every conceivable way.""No one would believe me but at times I would choose wartime in Saigon over peacetime in Alabama."" Ha has known both in her life, actually. Born in Vietnam during the war, Ha lives with her mother and three older brothers. Her father disappeared years ago on a navy mission when Ha was just one. Today the family doesn't even know if he's alive, but when the chance comes to flee Saigon and make a new life in America, Ha's mother doesn't hesitate. Once they're settled in Alabama, Ha has a whole new set of problems ahead of her. She's homesick, mad that she's no longer the smartest girl in class, and tormented after school by some of the boys. Yet the solution, it seems, is not to become someone different but to take what she is already and find a way to make her new life work.In a wayInside Out and Back Againkind of marks the second coming of the verse novel. A couple years ago this style of writing for children was hugely popular, helped in no small part by Newbery Award winning books like Karen Hesse'sOut Of The Dust. For some it represented the perfect way to get to the heart of a story without unnecessary clutter. Unfortunately, others regarded it as a quick and easy way to write a novel with a word count only slightly higher than your average picture book. The market was saturated and finally verse novels began to peter out. It finally got to the point where I became convinced that the only way a verse novel would work would be if there was some reason for it to even BE in verse. If the author couldn't justify the format then why did they even choose that style of writing? I haven't reviewed a verse novel since 2009'sTropical Secrets: Holocaust Refugees in Cubaby Margarita Engle and like Engle's book, Thanhha Lai's novel is written in verse for a concrete, very good reason. In both cases you have stories where children were entering strange new lands where they did not necessarily know the language. To make this book a verse novel, the child reader gets to be inside Ha's head while at the same time encountering sentences that are broken up in ways different from your average middle grade novel. The result is simultaneously intimate and isolating. It's perfect.There are a fair number of children's books about immigrants coming to America, most of them historical in some way. Ha's story feels a bit more contemporary since it's set in the late 20th century. Other immigrant stories for kids always cover the same territory (hostile neighbors, the other kids at school, strange foods, etc.). What I like about Lai's book is that Ha does something I've rarely seen immigrant characters do in books for kids. She gets mad. I mean really rip-roaring, snorting, furious. Here she is, a bright kid, and now she has to feel like she's stupid all that time at school simply because English isn't her first language. It's infuriating! And it was this spark of anger that cinched Ha's character for me. You can have a sympathetic protagonist set upon by the world all you want, but when that character exhibits an emotion other than mere passive acceptance or sorrow, that's when you find something about them to hold on to. Ha's anger lets child readers really understand her. It's necessary to who she is, drilled home by the section called ""Wishes"". In that two page spread, Ha discusses all the things she wishes for, including the return of her father. Then, tellingly, ""Most I wish I were still smart.""Maybe what I really liked about the book was that it wasn't a one trick pony. Sure, much of it is about moving to America and what that's like. But it's also a novel about family. Ha's brothers are hugely annoying to her when the family is living in Vietnam. They're all older, after all, and they get a bit more attention and freedom. When the family uproots and leaves everything they've known behind, Ha begins to connect to them in new ways. She becomes a comfort and helpmate to her brother Khoi when he suffers a kind of nervous breakdown over the death of his baby chick. She learns self-defense from Vu, her Bruce Lee obsessed brother. And of course it's her brother Quang who really saves the day for her in the end (I won't give away how). The change is slow in coming, which keeps it from feeling manipulative or false. It's just a natural coming together of family members in a hostile world. Good stuff.As for the writing itself, I'm a bit tired of the term ""lyrical"". That's just personal, though, and I'm sure that if you troll the professional reviews for descriptions of the book that word will surface again and again in relation to this book. With good reason, of course. Lai knows from which she speaks. At the same time, though, she's making choices in the narrative that I found very interesting. For example, at first you think that you're reading a kind of pseudo-diary of Ha's life since her first two entries comes with dates (February 11th and 12th, respectively). Yet when you hit the third piece, it describes the ways in which Ha's brothers tease her ending, not with a specific date, but with the phrase, ""Every day"". In this way Lai is able to separate out the things that happen only once on a specific day and those things that occur frequently. It's a subtle technique, but it makes the author's point. Lai also makes small notes about the world that give a person pause. Since this is the story of a girl moving to Alabama in the early 70s, it will probably prompt a lot of discussion in bookgroups when she says of the cafeteria, ""On one side of the bright, noisy room, light skin. Other side, dark skin. Both laughing, chewing, as if it never occurred to them someone medium would show up.""Lai is also able to teach kids about Vietnamese society without coming off all school marmish. I knew about the holiday of Tet in a vague sense (mostly fromTen Mice for Tet), but what I didn't know was that not only is Tet a Vietnamese New Year's, it's also the day everyone celebrates their own birthdays.All told,Inside Out and Back Againhas the brevity of a verse novel packed with a punch many times its size. It's one of the lovelier books I've read in a long time, and can make you think about and question the entire immigrant novel genre, so long a permanent part of the American children's literary canon. Lai drew upon much of her own life to write this book. Now I'd like to see what she's capable of when she looks at other subjects as well. Great new author. Great new book.For ages 9-12.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8537327-inside-out-back-again,Inside Out & Back Again.txt
Les Fleurs du Mal,"Here's a recent essay on Baudelaire from the trusty, always-interesting online mag The Millions:http://www.themillions.com/2013/04/th...So as to try to follow that, I've got to disclose a bit of an embarrassment. Baudelaire was, for me, the kind of poet only certain kinds of people liked. By this I don't mean Francophiles or the merely pretentious but there was something that set a devotee of C.B. apart from your average earnest, quavering, verbose, nervous poet or poetry fanboy.It's hard to put it into words- maybe you know it when you see it- but there was something sort of...elegant...and...removed...and...cynicalabout somebody who felt like carting around this haunted menagerie everywhere they went, the way you just do with your favorite poets...I'm no stranger to French poetry or literary bleakness, believe you me, but there was always something slightly creepy about Baudelaire, I could never put my finger on why I recoiled from it and what this meant.There's the languid, morbid Romanticism, fond of grand statements and magnificent imagery; the surgically precise mastery of rhyme and meter (I don't speak more than toddler's French but you can pretty much get a good sense of this stuff with the original text facing the English translations); the utterly bleak yet exotic, nigh- perfumed insights, metaphoric associations and twists of phrase; the poet's own (and those of his poetic subjects) addictions and rhapsodies; the deep, indescribable longings muddled with spleen; the detestation of smug comfort and propriety with the love of the 'perverse', the 'occult' and the melodious rumination mixed with ominous, pervadingennui...Well, call me a hardheaded New England Pragmatist, but there was something sort of suspiciously sickly about this guy. I mean, here I am, 11:22pm, feasting on my pauper's pleasures of potato salad, a rather stale corn muffin and a can of Sprite. I'm very ok with this. Not necessarily dying to be anywhere else or doing much else. I'm content, in my clean, well-lighted place down the street from the apt. I mean, haunted wonderlands are all well and good but in the words of Peter Griffin, SOMEBODY THROW A FREAKING PIE!My oldest friend, a fine poet and a dedicated teacher and a loving husband and father, just loved this stuff when we were growing up. Still does, in fact. It inspired him. I never quite got it- I mean, there's plenty to take from the poems AS poems but really, where does one relate?I wasn't outraged by Baudelaire, I was given the willies. I was just pretty definitively turned-off by an elaborately detailed, mockingly erotic poem about finding a maggot-teeming corpse, spreadeagled, in the middle of a spring stroll with your lover...I get it, I get it, but I'm gonna start slowly backing away now, ok?...I didn't get it, and I didn't even really want to.Now that's totally changed. I don't quite know why.I think it's got something to do with reading Walter Benjamin's interesting take on Baudelaire's style and literary achievement on a bus on the way to visit said friend. Nothing I like better than a fine and appreciative literary assessment. And I really love it when someone's insights turn my own around...So that planted the seed, as did time and experience.I'm not the same person I was when I first encountered poetry, not to mention life itself, and my tastes haven't changed in the sense of the old favorites, the lodestars, but they've definitely widened and evolved and been enriched and (I think) deepened.I think I'm aware of ironies more than I ever was, and unfulfillment, loss, dead air and lights that turn off. I've been dealing with a long string of anguish, disappointment, despair, confusion and frustration. Time has worn away some of the gilding from the world, and this is what some like to call 'experience'. Ok, well, sure, but so what?Well, Baudelaire's one of the so-whats. I never understood what his kind of visionary poetics really meant, what it did and where it brought the craft of poetry and the interested, open-minded reader.I think in some ways this is the kind of poetry that you need to grow into. Rimbaud works just fine when you're pissed off and rebellious and Promethean and you're 16, but he was a genius and his work survives real scrutiny and lasts after the humidity of adolescence cools off...Baudelaire (a poet Rimbaud admired, btw, no mean feat in and of itself) requires a little more out of you to really start to absorb, I've found. Everybody knows by now that he was into hashish and absinthe and that he had plenty of torrid affairs and that he blew through most of his inheritance on the finest linens and dandied it up something fierce...He also had quite the lover/mistress/muse/femme fatale, as The Daily Beast makes clear:http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles...What I think I missed out on initially was the old soul that shifts and speaks within these tortured, skeptical, vivid, tastefully arranged and somehow gruesomely challenging poems.Baudelaire isn't interested in pissing off the stuffy, conventional reading public because he's a spoiled, creepy, brat it's because he has a vision of life (his own, his city's, etc) that just couldn't come across in any other guise.I'm making an ass of myself now, as per usual, so I'm going to stop bumbling down the explication road and just quote this poem in full. I'm not an expert or anything, but I definitely think that this poem is essential:ReversibilityAngel of gladness, do you know of anguish,Shame, of troubles, sobs, and of remorse,And the vague terrors of those awful nightsThat squeeze the heart like paper in a ball?Angel of gladness, do you know of pain?Angel of kindness, do you know of hatred,Clenched fists in the shadow, tears of gall,When Vengeance beats his hellish call to arms,And makes himself the captain of our will?Angel of kindness, do you know revenge?Angel of health, are you aware of FeversWho by pallid hospitals' great wallsStagger like exiles, with the lagging foot,Searching for sunlight, mumbling with their lips?Angel of health, do you know of disease?Angel of beauty, do you know of wrinkles,Fear of growing old, the great tormentTo read the horror of self-sacrificeIn eyes our avid eyes had drunk for years?Angel of beauty, do you know these lines?Angel of fortune, happiness and light,David in dying might have claimed the healthThat radiates from your enchanted flesh;But, angel, I implore only your prayers,Angel of fortune, happiness and light!I was reading this at work, looking out through the big windows and watching cold night full of pissing rain trembling in the puddles on the corner of the opposite side of the street, sky all black, stained yellow streetlights, city spaces, melancholic, churning...I think I get it now.Sometimes you have to pick the flowers yourself.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203220.Les_Fleurs_du_Mal,Les Fleurs du Mal.txt
Don't Call Us Dead,"REREAD (2024):Biennial ritual of rereading my favorite contemporary poetry collection of all time. Danez, the poet you are.I've reviewed this poetry collection extensively, so there's not much to add upon my rereads (I hereby vow to reread this collection every two years – it has worked really well for me over the past six years!), but I won't leave you without a new-found favorite from this collection, a poem called ""....nigga"":""somewhere a white boy is in his room, in the lunchroom, in the car, with his father, alone, in the dark, under his breath, as a battle cry, with the song, only with his white friends, in his lover's ear, when he's 8, when he's 40, as he comes, as tradition, as the punch line, just to try it ...""RERERAD (2022):Every two years in autumn I tend to find myself back with this collection. I discovered Smith's work by chance in 2018 and fell in love with their poetry. My appreciation for modern poetry is a constant struggle, I want to love it (bc I love poetry as an art form) but many modern poets just fall flat for me. Their words ring hollow, it feels like they have nothing of substance to say. Not Danez Smith though. They are my favorite modern poet and I keep returning to their work.Don't Call Us Deadis, in my humble opinion, their best work.It's a brutally honest and shockingly raw poetry collection which examines questions of race, gender, sexuality and illness. As a person living in a Black body in the US, a person who is perceived as a man and loves men (and loves sex!), and a person with HIV, Danez is fighting, has to fight, many battles. In consequence, their poems feel like a battle cry – some hopeful, others aggressive and loud, but all powerful and rattling.During my first two reads of this collection, I was mostly interested in Danez's poems about race and racism in the US. These were poems that I could relate to (on some level) and that I could fit into the African American literary tradition I was familiar with. ""dear white america"" and ""dinosaurs in the hood"" became instant favorites, as well as ""every day is a funeral & a miracle"" and ""dream where every black person is standing by the ocean"". I couldn't quite grasp their poems on (homo-)sexuality and being HIV+. These poems overwhelmed me, their language was so intrusive, wet, and invasive ... I found many of them quite shocking, tbh.During this reread though I consciously tried to immerse myself in these poems as well, and what can I say? It worked. It worked wonders actually. I already LOVED this collection but I think I love it a little bit more now. With the exception of only one poem I could make sense of every single poem in this collection, every poem touched me in some way.In ""summer, somewhere"", Danez pictures a place for all the dead Black boys who died due to racist injustices but also – and this is something I only took note of during my reread – due to homophobia. They write: ""outside our closet / i found a graden. he would love it / here. he could love me here."" I mean, what a beautiful picture!A new favorite poem – ""at the down-low house party"" – focuses on closeted gay men who hide their sexuality and their desires at house parties, who want to come across as cool and aloof and unbothered by male bodies. Their quiet sham is disrupted when a ""glittering boy shows up, starts vogueing & shit"" and ""his sharp hips pierce our desire, make our mouths water / & water & we call himfaggotmeaningbravery"". The poem is so vivid and one I'll keep coming back to.Danez Smith likens their illness to a ""bloodfuneral"", in ""it won't be a bullet"", one of the first poems of the collection, they set the tone: ""i'm not the kind of black man who dies on the news. / i'm the kind who grows thinner & thinner & thinner"". In ""crown"", Danez writes: ""my blood a river named medusa. every man / i touch turns into a monument."" Throughout the collection you get the sense that Danez felt that their HIV+ diagnosis was inevitable. A fate that awaits too many Black gay men. Sometimes their imagery was too vivid and invasive for me but all in all, you really get their sense of urgency and desperation.I wanna end this review with the last lines of Danez's poem ""little prayer"":""let this be the healing / & if not let it be"".Amen.REVIEW (2020):Don't Call Us Deadwas my favorite poetry collection of 2018. Ever since then, I read every single work that Danez Smith has published. They remain my favorite poet until this day. Their poetry is so real and raw and truly comes alive on the page. There are just very few artist who manage to completely capture my attention and move me so deeply with their words. Last month, I thought it was time to reread this brilliant collection.In my humble opinion,Don't Call Us Deadis Danez's best work and I would highly recommend starting with this collection. In it, Danez confronts race, police brutality, gender, sexuality, illness ... what it means to be HIV+, what it means to grow up in a Black body in the US, what it means to grow up gay in a Black family. It is an incredibly personal collection in which Danez makes themselves extremely vulnerable. They let us in on their inner thoughts, their most intimate feelings, emotions of anger and frustration and joy and hope and hopelessness.ReadingDon't Call Us Deadfeels like coming home. It is an incredibly brave collection that addresses what needs to be addressed. In a clear voice. Sharp. Bold. Loud. Danez doesn't hold back.My favorite poems from this collection are: 1)dinosaurs in the hood, 2) dream where every black person is standing by the ocean, 3)every day is a funeral & a miracle, 4)dear white americaand 5)summer, somewhere. [I linked videos, if available, of Danez performing these poems. I would highly recommend watching them perform their poetry because their words are meant to be heard, not read.]I would like to discuss some of these poems a little further because they're all brilliant and hold a special place in my heart.Dinosaurs in the hoodis by far my favorite poem in this collection and quite frankly, my favorite poem of all time. I love poems hat have a clear message, that tell a story. In the poem, Danez imagines what it would be like to direct a movie. A movie about ""a little black boy playing / with a toy dinosaur on the bus"", about a ""neighborhood of royal folks— / children of slaves & immigrants & addicts & exiles—saving their town / from real ass dinosaurs.""It is a humorous poem that will make you laugh and smile but at the same time, also swallow deeply and feel pain when Danez insists that ""no one kills the black boy. & no one kills / the black boy. & no one kills the black boy.""Dinosaurs in the hoodexplores how Black people are portrayed in mainstream media. All the stereotypes and tropes. All the trauma that Black characters (and people) are forced to undergo in order to please a predominantly white audience. By breaking with these norms, Danez manages to write an incredibly empowering poem. Their hopefulness at the end is electrifying: ""besides, the only reason / i want to make this is for the first scene anyway: little black boy / on the bus with his toy dinosaur, his eyes wide & endless / his dreams possible, pulsing, & right there."" It is so important that we imagine our own futures, futures full of hopes and dreams and light and possibilities.My second favorite poem in this collection is called ""dream where every black person is standing by the ocean"":& we say to herwhat have you done with our kin you swallowed?& she saysthat was ages ago, you’ve drunk them by now& we don’t understand& then one woman, skin dark as all of uswalks to the water’s lip, shouts Emmett, spits&, surely, a boy beginscrawling his way to shoreThis poem always makes me cry. For me, it's an incredibly piece and tool for working through trauma. Danez uses the image of the ocean, which has served as a burial ground for too many victims of the transatlantic slave, to connect their Black audience to their ancestor through water. Water that stands for the bloodshed but also for memory. Water that isn't just the ocean but also the rivers, lakes, seas in which Black people were drowned – like 14-year-old Emmett who was found on the shores of the Tallahatchie River. For me, the poem also strikes an extremely hopeful chord. Danez connects us to our ancestors. They show that there is a bond there that can never be broken. That they live in us, that we live because and for them. The poem is short, yet powerful.Summer, somewhereis a longer narrative poem in which Danez imagines an alternative heaven for Black boys (who were murdered by police or through other acts of racism).please, don't call us dead,call us alive someplace better.Danez shows that hope appears as a form of resistance and rebirth. The poem is an extended sequence, a dream-like vision of ""unfuneraling"" Black boys shot dead by police. Here we find anguish for lives severed in their prime, for the acquittal of Trayvon Martin's killer, George Zimmerman, in the summer of 2013, as well as the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown during the following summer. The result is tremendously moving. The poem functions as an exalting and longed-for acknowledgement of historical pain.Indear white america, a poem that went viral on Youtube, Danez's anger finally boils over. It is a reckoning with white racists, white ""allies"", the white middle class, white liberals. Danez finally has had enough with the supposedly well-intentioned ignorance of white Americans who ""just don’t see race"", or the wilful hatred of others who do.i tried, white people. i tried to love you, but you spent my brother’s funeral making plans for brunch, talking too loud next to his bones. you took one look at the river, plump with the body of boy after girl after sweet boi & askwhy does it always have to be about race?because you made it that way!As a Black person living in a predominantly white society, I could relate to EVERY. SINGLE. FUCKING. WORD. Danez was saying. They were speaking from my soul.Dear white americais a poem that continuously has me shook because Danez doesn't hold back and they no longer give any fucks. Upon my reread, I also noticed that they paid homage to James Baldwin by using Jimmy's famous lines: ""How much time do you want for your progress?""It is extremely disheartening that Danez's words remain relevant as ever [and will still be relevant in 50 years]. Structural racism is the foundation on which our societies are built. Dismantling this system will take hundreds of years. It's frustrating how long it takes for white people to simply see you as human, as equal. It's frustrating and exhausting. However, people like Danez Smith give me hope and strength. They let me know I'm not alone. They let me know that there are shoulders I can stand on, people with whom I can walk hand in hand. All the people who fought before me, fight beside me, and will fight after me are an incredible source of hope and strength.Here's to us. <3// Oh, I won this book for my BookTubeAThon Book Dominoes challenge (go me). Not sure if I have to disclose this since I wasn't paid or even required to write this review but maybe some of ya'll wanna know that I didn't pay for this book myself as I won it in a giveaway. :)",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33375618-don-t-call-us-dead,Don't Call Us Dead.txt
peep,"Danielle Blau's Hecht Prize winning debut collection, PEEP invites you into a world so strange it is utterly familiar, a world from our ancient past that could also be the future--or a twisted version of the present. It is a mirror world where the husk of our culture shows starkly, and yet it is lit by joy, in the words, the verses themselves. PEEP is uncanny, primal, magical, capturing hopelessness, gridlock, our impact on the environment and those around us, questioning progress and the language we use to speak to each other, each little peep a little life desperate to not pass unnoticed. ""The first impressions Danielle Blau's poems give the reader are impressions of newness and immediacy. These impressions also happen to be, along with the many others that billow out of these rich and abundant poems, the second and fifth (and fiftieth) impressions. Blau's newness and immediacy aren't ephemeral or fugitive. They aren't calculated or contrived. And they aren't generated from fashionable detailing or cultural signalling. Her poems glitter, and they're incredibly energetic, but they're never flashy, and their persuasiveness derives from deep sources. Though her flexible diction is present-day, though she has a gender-specific savviness and élan that probably wouldn't have been possible before the advent of the twenty-first century (or thereabouts), though she's street-wise, nothing in her work is just contemporary, nothing is independent of anything else. As hip as she is, she's also a throwback to the Romantic vocation of organic form. All her effects are emanations of the fullness with which her sensibility inhabits language and the confident way her imagination takes possession of her experience ... peep is a tour de force, and it's more than a tour de force. It displays deep within itself, for all its intellectual and imaginative power and self-delight, a curious tenderness and vulnerability. The book glories in language and thinking; it's imaginative and bold; but it's also intimate. If I were asked to account for this intimacy, especially in the face of all the other effects that Blau realizes, I might say, diffidently, that Blau is the performer of her own experience, but she is also its scholar and critic.""--Vijay Seshadri Poetry.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62759364-peep,peep.txt

The Girl Who Became a Rabbit,"“And a body shouldn’t have to stay as a body does / not want to be. Navigate new skin, find thread against / bone. Let the imagined body be more important than the / real.”Thank you so much to the author for the gifted eARC! This one is out in the US on September 10th, 2024 from Hub City Press.The Girl Who Became a Rabbit by Emilie Menzel is an evocative meditation on the unruly, mutable nature of bodies and the ways they refuse to adhere to neat definitions. In this lyric poem, Menzel expertly captures the sensation of being tethered to a body that transforms in unexpected ways, often against one’s will. This is a work that pulses with the tension between the desire to control the body and the reality of its chaotic autonomy.What struck me most about The Girl Who Became a Rabbit is Menzel’s deft exploration of the body as both a site of transformation and an emotional landscape. The imagery of bodies that fold in on themselves, that spit things out only to swallow them back, creates a visceral sense of discomfort and fascination. The bodies in this poem are in constant flux, a reflection of Menzel’s larger themes about the futility of trying to impose order on the disorderliness of physical existence. It’s a haunting depiction of the ways in which bodies refuse to be static, and Menzel’s language embodies that same fluidity.Menzel’s lyricism is as fragmented as it is intimate. The poem unfolds in a stream-of-consciousness style that mirrors the non-linear, dreamlike way we experience our own bodies. Her metaphors are dense and abstract, yet they cut to the core of deeply familiar emotions: the desire for home, the yearning to make sense of one's self, and the longing for connection amidst the chaos of embodiment. Menzel's writing blurs the lines between the physical and emotional, weaving vulnerability into the very fabric of her language.Underlying this poem is a profound meditation on the body as both earth and home. Menzel asks whether the body can serve as a refuge, exploring how our physical forms shape our identities and whether they can offer the solace of stability. Yet, the ever-changing nature of the body in this poem suggests that home, much like identity, is elusive—an idea that feels especially poignant for those of us who struggle to find grounding within our own skin.This book, while brief, is an immersive, almost otherworldly experience. It reads like a modern-day fairytale—a reimagining of what a body can be, how it can transform, and what it means to live within one. Menzel’s ability to navigate themes of trauma, grief, and alienation through such lush, lyric language is nothing short of brilliant. The Girl Who Became a Rabbit leaves an indelible mark, raising profound questions about the limits and possibilities of the body. I can’t wait to see what Menzel does next.📖 Recommended For: Readers who enjoy fragmented, poetic prose, those intrigued by the body as a site of transformation, anyone interested in deeply introspective explorations of identity, and fans of Bluets by Maggie Nelson.🔑 Key Themes: Bodily Autonomy and Chaos, Transformation and Grief, Home and Belonging, Alienation and Connection, Trauma and Healing.Content / Trigger Warnings: Animal Death (minor), Gore (minor), Blood (minor), Self-Harm (minor).",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203610612-the-girl-who-became-a-rabbit,The Girl Who Became a Rabbit.txt
She Fits Inside These Words (Volume 4),"It has been way too long since my last book review but I’m here with yet another poetry book. This one is the newly published “she fits inside these words” by husband and wife r.h. Sin and Samantha King Holmes, and R.M. Drake. “Ars longa, vita brevis” are the immortal words from Hippocrates written on the back of this book. It means, “skillfulness takes time, and life is short”. I like this quote but I think it really only vaguely fits the theme of this book, and I say that because there’s barely a theme to this book. I have read entires from each of these poets before but only attached to Sin. This is 100% still his book, everything about it matched his style and he gets the most pages, out of five chapters he gets three. None of the three poets have matching themes and King’s poetry is nearly inseparable from Sins’s. Sin brings his usual topics of relationship advice for women (from his straight male view). It’s starting to get annoying how he caters to a very specific audience (probably because the books keep selling). I feel so left out when I read his work but it’s good work. I just don’t know how much more he can write on the same topic, almost everything he writes in here is a rewording of the same thing. King’s chapter slows everything down because she writes in a longer prose style that puts much more words on each page (which must be why her section is the shortest). And Drake’s chapter I’d say is the best. His chapter starts with this beautiful poem dedicated to his brother and instantly switches things up by not being a poem about empowering women. And while that’s not a bad message to do, it’s the only message Sin ever does. Sin also uses a prose style for most of this entry in his long list and I feel he works better in a more traditional style. At the end of the day, this is still a very enjoyable read that you can speed through. Of course I’ll continue buying Sin’s books because I’m dedicated at this point and the cover art is super aesthetically pleasing and looks good on my shelf. All that said, “she fits inside these words” is probably an 8/10 (4/5 Stars) from me. Excited to see what’s next, hoping Sin shocks us all and mixes it up for once. -Tyler.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55711769-she-fits-inside-these-words-volume-4,She Fits Inside These Words (Volume 4).txt
In Mad Love and War,"""Grace"" (1)""The haunting voices of the starved and mutilated... I could say grace was a woman with time on her hands, or a white buffalo escaped from memory. But in that dingy light it was a promise of balance... And Wind, I am still crazy. I know there is something larger than the memory of a dispossessed people. We have seen it.""""Deer Dancer"" (5-6)""Of course we noticed when she came in. We were Indian ruins. She was the end of beauty. No one knew her, the stranger whose tribe we recognized, her family related to deer, if that's who she was, a people accustomed to hearing songs in pine trees, and making them hearts...Some people see vision in a burned tortilla, some in the face of a woman.This is a bar of broken survivors, the club of shotgun, knife wound, of poison by culture...How do I say it? In this language there are no words for how the real world collapses... So I look at the stars in this strange city, frozen to the back of the sky, the only promises that ever make sense...and that's when she broke, became human...That's what I'd like to know, what are we all doing in a place like this?... The way back is deer breath on icy windows...And then she took off her clothes. She shook loose memory, waltzed with the empty lover we'd all become.She was the myth slipped down through dreamtime. The promise of feast we all knew was coming. The deer who crossed through knots of a curse to find us...But I imagined her like this, not a stained red dress with tape on her heels but the deer who entered our dream in white dawn, breathed mist into pine trees, her fawn a blessing of meat, the ancestors who never left.""""Mercy"" (20)""Forget the massacres, proclamations of war, / rumors of wars. / I won't pour rifle shot through the guts of someone / I'm told is my enemy. / Hell, my own enemy is right here. / Can you look inside, see past the teeth worn down / by meat and anger, / can you see? / Sometimes the only filter / is a dead cat in the road... unless this light / becomes a bayonet of sound, hands of fire / to lead you to yourself / until you cry / mercy.""""Eagle Poem"" (65)""To pray you open your whole selfTo sky, to earth, to sun, to moonTo one whole voice that is you.And know there is moreThat you can't see, can't hear,Can't know except in momentsSteadily growing, and in languagesThat aren't always sound but otherCircles of motion.Like eagle that Sunday morningOver Salt River.

Neon Vernacular: New and Selected Poems,"""I am this space/my body believes in,"" ends ""The Unnatural State of the Unicorn,"" the first poem in Yusef Komunyakaa 's 1986 volume, I APOLOGIZE FOR THE EYES IN MY HEAD (Wesleyan). That the body itself, apart from mind or soul, can possess beliefs--or memories or hopes or regrets or revelations--comes as no surprise to anyone familiar with Komunyakaa's work, or to anyone discovering this poet for the first time through NEON VERNACULAR, which includes rich samplings from books now out of print. The tense, often colloquial language of Komunyakaa's tautly lineated poems in this volume and in his newest, MAGIC CITY, enacts on the page the muscle and movement of the human body as it walks, talks, makes love,sings the blues, even kills. Indeed, not since Berryman has an American poet developed and then used a relatively standardized style to such effect. Short lines, short sentences, fragments, and the ampersand appear in Komunyakaa's earliest work as well as in his most recent. These technicaldevices are exploited with increasing skill in poems whose subjects range from lyric meditations on love and jazz to Komunyakaa's experiences in Vietnam to his boyhood in Louisiana.The short-lined poem, a staple of the Deep Image movement, has seemed stale and tiresome in recent years, as too often it has been shaped by poets who equate the line with a unit of syntax. While this lineation may have once appeared interesting in Stanley Kunitz's THE LAYERS (OP) or the earlier work of his protegée Louise Gluck, too often it creates a rhythmic portentousness. Komunyakaa mostly avoids this pitfall, in part because of his sensitive and well~tuned ear, in part because he knows that a short line as well as a long one should possess both content and integrity.Perhaps the most interesting feature of Komunyakaa's development is how his unique sense of line and rhythm, though deriyed from his deep understanding of jazz, suddenly comes into focus when he addresses not the subject of music--""Villon/Leadbelly,"" ""Copacetic Mingus,"" ""Elegy for Thelonius""--but war. TOYS IN A FIELD, published in1986 by Black River Press, and DIEN CAI DAU, issued more widely in 1988 by Wesleyan, mark the beginning of Komunyakaa's most compelling work, both volumes resulting from the poet's tour of duty in Vietnam. At first it might appearstrange that such material would sharpen and focus the accomplishments of LOST IN THE BONEWHEEL FACTORY (OP, 1979), COPACETIC (Wesleyan, 1984), and the aforementioned I APOLOGIZE FOR THE EYES IN MY HEAD, Southeast Asia and the horrors enacted there being very far removed from the world of bayous and crawfish and Big Mama Thornton and hoodoo--and lynchings, or the ever-present fear thereof. Or maybe not so far removed. For the steamy jungles of Vietnam must have seemed like the humid Louisiana landscape of Komunyakaa's childhood become nighnnarish. ""Camouflaging the Chimera"" exemplifies both the terrifyingly phantasmagoric quality of the poems in these two collections and Komunyakaa's characteristic style at its most finely tuned and wrought.... Chameleonscrawled our spines, changing from dayto night: green to gold,gold to black. But we waitedtill the moon touched metal,till something almost brokeinside us. VC struggledwith the hillside, like black silkwrestling iron through grass.We weren't there. The river ranthrough our bones. Small animals took refugeagainst our bodies; we held our breath,ready to spring the L-shapedambush, as a world revolvedunder each man's eyelid.A return to an earlier world is the most obvious connecting thread between the poems in MAGIC CITY and the ""New Poems"" of NEON VERNACULAR. Though Komunyakaa's childhood memories of Bogalusa are scarred by savage racism in poems like ""The Whistle,"" ""The Steel Plate,"" and ""History Lesson,"" a deep but unsentimental love of place and family invests these recent poems with a new and expansive warmth, at times even gentleness. The modulation of tone leads him to experiment with a child~like narrative voice reminiscent of Elizabeth Bishop in MAGIC CITY's opener, ""Venus Flytraps,"" and with longer, sectioned poems as well. The virtuosic ""Changes; or Reveries at a Window Overlooking a Country Road, with Two Women Talking Blues in the Kitchen,"" a double-columned piece that counterpoints two women's gossip about local love and loss and betrayal with a meditation on jazz and poetry, is a stunning achievement; no less impressive in its own way is ""Birds on a Powerline,"" which ends with the words ofKomunyakaa's grandmother after his rerum from Vietnam: ""Jesus, I promised you. Now/He's home safe, I'm ready. / My traveling shoes on. My teeth/ In. I got on clean underwear.""The phrase ""poet's poet"" is overused and probably not terribly helpful to general readers who sample a book or two of poetry each year, staring dazedly at publications such as this one and trying to decide what's really worth their while--and their 10 bucks. An immersion in YusefKomunyakaa's poetry and its exactingly crafted restraint is powerful persuasion against the hyperbole that has become, unfortunately, the language of the reviewer's tribe; thus, attempting to take this poet's graceful and searing reserve as example seems the most fitting tribute in a reviewof his two first-rate collections.(originally published in THE BLOOMSBURY REVIEW)",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61204.Neon_Vernacular,Neon Vernacular New and Selected Poems.txt
Ooga-Booga: Poems,"After finishing this book, I started to read Seidel's bio. I stopped when I got to the second paragraph where it said he suggested corrections to Ezra Pound's translation of Confucius despite not understanding the Chinese language. My gut says that's all you need to know about him.I didn't understand much of this book and yet you can feel the language. It punches you or taunts you or just dances around in choreographed numbers so offbeat that you reread lines to see if they were put together with actual letters or just broken rocks. Incongruous. Bawdy. Sometimes romantically materialistic. Every time your mind feels like it's just found the downbeat, Seidel changes the time signature. He poems in sentences. Short, staccato-like statements. Baffling yet moth-to-the-flame alluring. This is the kind of writer you love to hate or hate to love.A lot of the allure (for me) was the way his ideas sort of build on themselves, layered tangentially but taking you just slightly left (or right) of where you're expecting them to go. For instance, in ""On Being Debonair"" he writes of the moon:""I like the way she speaks to me.Everything about me is bespoke.""And then the next stanza pulls you to a dissonant description of place:""The desert this time of yearIs troops in desert camouflage.""He'll throw in what appear to be ridiculously simplistic rhymes in the middle of stanzas or repeat a line or word with slight changes that again build to something more or jolt you just off course... of course, just enough to keep you interested. But then it's never about you the reader--the writing always seems dedicated to itself--the pursuit of an idea, the play of the words. Or he'll let the reader's mind complete a thought like in this stanza from ""The Death of the Shah"":""The future of psychoanalysisIs a psychology of surface.Stay on the outside side.My poor analystSuffered a stroke and became a needy child.As to the inner life: let the maid.""Some of my favorites from this slim collection:- ""Homage to Pessoa""- ""Fog""- ""E-mail from an Owl""- ""East Hampton Airport""- ""To Die For""- ""Barbados""- ""Organized Religion""- ""Cassanova Getting Older""I'll leave you with one of the more disturbing but poignant pieces.THE BLACK-EYED VIRGINSA terrorist rides the rails underwaterFrom one language to another in a packed train of LondonRugby fans on their way to the big match in ParisAnd a flock of Japanese schoolgirls ready to be fuckedIn their school uniforms in paradise.This is all just after Madrid in the reign of terror.This is the girls' first trip outside Japan.The terrorist swings in the hammock of their small skirts and black socks.The chunnel train stops in the tunnel with an announcementThat everyone now alive is already human remains.The terrorists have seen to it that trainsSwap human body parts around with bombs.The Japanese schoolgirls say so sorry.Their new public hair is made of light.----------------------------------------NEW WORD I LEARNED FROM THIS BOOK:pseudocyesis",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/804491.Ooga_Booga,Ooga-Booga Poems.txt
The Upside-Down World: Meetings with the Dutch Masters,"Self-discovery immersed in the Dutch Golden Age (cities in The Netherlands; 1976 to present-day): “In every age, art is an experiment for every artist, just as, in every age, life is an experiment for every person,” wrote Benjamin Moser years ago in an article, Can Writers Still ‘Make it New’? Soon after, he wrote about writing as a “calling,” as “an inner purpose,” and “a means of understanding, and thus of elevating, our everyday lives.”Those essays were written during Moser’s quest to learn “something new” about the great Dutch artists and their 17th century masterwork paintings as his way to understand and connect with the new country he moved to when he was twenty-five, The Netherlands. The Upside-Down World: Meeting with the Dutch Masters took nearly twenty-five more years to accomplish.Can you imagine spending nearly half your life “consumed” by one thing? Granted a huge undertaking given how prolific the era was, and how difficult to unearth something new for most of the artists he applies a microscopic art critic’s lens to, most unknown to many of us. Repeatedly he chants, “Almost nothing was known.” The challenge for others, Rembrandt the most famous, was to discover something new that meshed with Moser’s mission to find “something higher” for mastering “something about life” – and himself.From an art appreciation point-of-view, you will learn why Rembrandt was “great in every field,” even if many of his paintings are too dark and gruesome for your taste. The real intrigue, though, is understanding the man behind the book who devoted so much passion, dogged pursuit, research, and speculation immersing us in Moser’s study of the Dutch masters.The writer sparks interest since the two books he’s written garnered the kind of recognition for excellence he strives for. Why This World: A Biography of Clarice Lispector was named finalist for the National Critics Award, Notable Book by the New York Times, and won Brazil’s Cultural Diplomacy State Prize for his biography of their Ukrainian-born novelist. Sontag: Her Life and Work earned him a Pulitzer-Prize.As a reviewer of memoirs, I can offer opinions. Art historians can address the rest.Handsomely designed with high-quality glossy paper and over 300 illustrations, Moser’s third book looks and feels like an art book. So why is it billed as “a revealing self-portrait”?Because the memoir is something new. Seeming to say you don’t need to know my intimate details to know me. Know what matters to me, instead. Thus, casting an atmosphere of mystique like some of the artists known for their atmosphere, moods, perspectives.Moser admires artists whose work is subtle. So is he. Attracted to the elegance of subtlety, he’s drawn to art that “evoked emotions that were more intense because they are indirect.” Is Moser explaining his memoirist approach demonstrates his intensity of purpose by being indirect? (Direct exceptions found in the Introduction and Afterword.)“When you see Vermeer’s work together,” you “wonder what they are really saying,” echoes how we feel assessing what the author’s art critiques and commentary are really saying about himself.The prose is both elegiac and down-to-earth. Valuing authenticity, not following another artist’s style, render Rembrandt’s followers as not rising to greatness. Great art doesn’t have to be loved, but it does have to create something unique.Artists in this group include Pieter Saenredam’s architectural perspectives. “Was he aware, at the time, of the enormity of the task?” Moser asks. Is this also a statement about his young self when he began this enormous endeavor?That the Houston born American connects with artists who “saw beauty in old things,” felt a “closeness” to these Old World artists tells you something about his sense of belongingness in a world that valued craftsmanship. A stiller world, one that brought him peacefulness.“Puzzled” by the meaning of an artist’s painting seems to imply puzzlement with today’s upside-down world. This is also an art term Dutch artists used for describing art that turned the bourgeoisie world on its head.Discussing “realism” versus “idealism,” Moser points out that although one of the genres the Dutch are famous for — still-life paintings — may not have been as realistic as they appear since life in the 1600s was harsh for the majority of Dutch people. Strikingly, many artists featured, and their families, died young. Forty, “old.”We shouldn’t be surprised artists want to lift us up. Vermeer a prime example of brilliant light. Hendrick Avercamp for his spirited ice skating scenes.Moser too seeks lightness, “happiness” not loss. “Artists know their failures as well as anyone, which is why I don’t like to dwell upon this painful thought.”The prose is the work of a wordsmith who has a “fear of ignorance.” You’ll learn new words. The one that pleases especially is sprezzatura, defined in the art world as a work that gives the impression of ease but took considerable effort – like this unusual memoir told through art.You will come away with some historical details you won’t forget. For instance, 165,000 “starving” Dutch people after the Holocaust waited in long lines to see a Rembrandt exhibition. Mosher’s heartening explanation is that art is a “symbol of dignity of a free people.”It’s refreshing that even though a “jewel-like” Vermeer painting may be “so perfect,” others “shocked.” Moser reactions are telling as those failed paintings brought him “closer” to the artist as “a man struggling” – like he apparently has.Moser wrote the Vermeer chapter in the third-person voice – “the man who writes this sentence is forty-five years old” – when he could look back and feel “proud” of his work. The struggles he went through, he says, are no longer as important to him as when he began his journey. Failure isn’t “the end,” rather the “beginning.”Moser has revealed himself as a man of seriousness, scholarship, dedication to writing as a noble profession creating his own “aura” of the grace he attaches to Dutch paintings.The concept of grace plays out, then, artistically and personally. A painting’s “charisma” defined as “that indescribable quality of grace.” It’s one of many observations and speculations that make you stop reading to think.Memorable painters include: Paulus Potter for the animals he painted that “elevated” their status – serene cows roaming, animals in the barn, majestic dogs. Jan Steen for his moods, “warning against vanity and vice.” Meindert Hobbema for the “balletic sway of the trees.” Jacob Van Ruisdael for his landscapes Moser explains differently than our Nature imagery. Its “land-shaped” reflecting how Dutch land had to be shaped by man due to its flatness and waterways. Moser feels “close to this invisible man,” to his “introspection” and “meditation,” aspects that fit his thoughtful commentary.Moser still lives in the same 17th century Dutch house in Utrecht when he set off on his coming-of-age journey. The same house Vermeer lived in! He loves – and we appreciate how much it means to him – to look out the same windows seeing what the great artist saw.

The Collected Poems of Lucille Clifton 1965-2010,"‘today we are possible.’‘Lucille is another word for light,’ wrote the greatToni Morrisonin an essay on Lucille Clifton, ‘which is the soul of ‘enlightenment.’ And she knew it.’ Lucille Clifton is my absolute favorite poet. She is an immortal icon in the art form and just a delight to read and learn from. It is difficult to review a ‘collected works’ so I’d like to make this a celebration of her in general because her work is such a momentous achievement and gift. She is remarkable. Her works centers on empowering explorations of the Black experience and womanhood told through succinctly perfect poetry. Let’s take a moment to celebrate the life and legacy of Lucille Clifton, and what better way to begin than with the poem ‘won’t you celebrate with me’ from the collectionThe Book of Light:won't you celebrate with mewhat i have shaped intoa kind of life? i had no model.born in babylonboth nonwhite and womanwhat did i see to be except myself?i made it uphere on this bridge betweenstarshine and clay,my one hand holding tightmy other hand; come celebratewith me that everydaysomething has tried to kill meand has failed.Lucille Clifton was born Thelma Lucille Sayles, in Depew, New York on June 27, 1936. She studied at Howard University before transferring to State University of New York at Fredonia. Here she was introduced to Fred Clifton, a philosophy professor who would become her husband, in 1958 by none other thanIshmael Reedas he was organizing a community Drama workshop in Buffalo. Both Lucille and Fred starred in Reed’s production of Tennessee William’sThe Glass Menagerie.Lucille had shown her poetry to Reed who enjoyed it so much he passed it along to his friend, the greatLangston Hughesin 1966. Her work would be included in his anthologyThe Poetry Of The Negro, 1746-1970, which really kickstarted her career. Her first collection,Good Times, would go on to be included in the New York Time’s 10 Best Books of the Year. From here she would go on to a highly regarded and decorated career, having a double Pulitzer Prize nomination (the first poet to do so), served as the Poet Laureate of Maryland, won the Ruth Lily Poetry Prize in 2007 and was honored with a Robert Frost Lifetime Achievement Award. In addition to poetry, Clifton wrote many children’s books, herEverett Anderson's Goodbyewas given a Coretta Scott King Award in 1984. She would taught at many universities, including St. Mary’s College of Maryland, Colombia and Dartmouth. Sadly, Lucille Clifton passed away from cancer on February 13, 2010.blessing the boats(at St. Mary's)may the tidethat is entering even nowthe lip of our understandingcarry you outbeyond the face of fearmay you kissthe wind then turn from itcertain that it willlove your back may youopen your eyes to waterwater waving foreverand may you in your innocencesail through this to that.There is a powerful simplicity to a Lucille Clifton poem. She refrains from capitalization and there is never any excess in her work, just direct and perfectly constructed poetry that sings from the heart louder and more beautiful than all the choirs on earth. PoetRita Doveonce described Clifton’s poetry as as‘Lucille Clifton’s poems are compact and self-sufficient...Her revelations then resemble the epiphanies of childhood and early adolescence, when one’s lack of preconceptions about the self allowed for brilliant slippage into the metaphysical, a glimpse into an egoless, utterly thingful and serene world.’In such a small space, Clifton is able to say so much and say it so memorably. ‘I don’t go get a poem,’ Clifton said about her writing process, ‘it calls me and I accept it.’ This idea of channeling a poem is evident in her work, that speaks from so deep down in the soul it is as if magic. Because if there is anything magical in this world, it is the poetry of Lucille Clifton.‘Poetry is a matter of life, not just a matter of language.’Much of her work centers Blackness and womanhood, examining the intersections between them in a way that speaks out proudly and confidently. ‘She sifts the history of African Americans for honor,’ write Toni Morrison, ‘she plumbs that history for justice...From humor to love or rage, Clifton’s poems elicit a visceral response.’ Clifton tackles topics of sexuality, gender and race as something to take pride in and to uplift others. ‘I come to comfort the afflicted and to afflict the comfortable,’ she once wrote, and she takes each topic head on to make her voice heard. In poems such asHomage to my HairandHomage to my Hips, she speaks openly of the Black woman body as something holy:homage to my hipsthese hips are big hipsthey need space tomove around in.they don't fit into littlepetty places. these hipsare free hips.they don't like to be held back.these hips have never been enslaved,they go where they want to gothey do what they want to do.these hips are mighty hips.these hips are magic hips.i have known themto put a spell on a man andspin him like a top!She writes of the strength of Black women, but reminds us that this strength is something that was imposed on them for survival. ‘America made us heroines / not wives.’ she writes in the poemBlack Women, ‘we hid our ladyness / to save our lives.’ She consistently reminds us that Black women exist in a world controlled by white men and towards this she shakes a fist of liberation. She speaks of the ways she is targeted because she has the bravery to speak out, an act that is brave because the white population has made it dangerous.i feel the reverberationof myselfin white americaa black catin the belfryhangingandringing(fromwhite america)There is a proud womanhood at work within her poetry that reminds us of how incredible a strong woman is in a world so set against her. Poems such as ‘wishes for sons’ fromNext: New Poemsdemonstrates her wry humor as a method of devastating satire.‘i wish them cramps.i wish them a strange townand the last tampon.i wish them no 7-11.i wish them one week earlyand wearing a white skirt.i wish them one week late.later i wish them hot flashesand clots like youwouldn't believe. let theflashes come when theymeet someone special.let the clots comewhen they want to.let them think they have acceptedarrogance in the universe,then bring them to gynecologistsnot unlike themselves.Motherhood, childbirth, and miscarriage all are granted heroic and mythical proportions in her work. There is a rightful rage directed towards the oppression of Black people, such as inthe photograph: a lynching, or the promise that Black liberation will come and the fate of the obdurate white hegemony will be one of their own making, even opening this interpretation to one of climate justice:‘the airyou have pollutedyou will breathethe watersyou have poisonedyou will drink’She writes to give strength as a call-to-arms, to give comfort, and to leave those who disagree shaking in their shoes. It is a voice that is brave and bold, one that commands attention and respect.‘...she opens herselfto the risk of flame andwalks toward an oceanof days.’(fromnew year)Clifton plays with language in a clever way, often using mythological and biblical allusions to add an element of the epic to human nature. In her series of lucifer poetry, she subverts the idea of the devil by reclaiming him through his association with darkness/blackness.‘i the only luciferlight-bringercreated out of fireilluminate i couldand soilluminate i did.’The poem plays with concepts of Adam and Eve, in which Eve speaks as a voice of truth in an active voice instead of as a passive, ‘treacherous’ image that patriarchal readings of the Bible have accustomed to readers. Though there is likely no better image of the divine and letting oneself go to fate thanthe lesson of the falling leaves:the leaves believesuch letting go is lovesuch love is faithsuch faith is gracesuch grace is godi agree with the leaves.Clifton has great commentary on mortality, often reflecting on death such as the loss of her husband from cancer and her own struggles with breast cancer. ‘have we not been good children / did we not inherit the earth,’ she asks in1994, speaking of her own cancer diagnosis. ‘to be born with breasts / you know how dangerous it is / to wear dark skin.’ she says earlier, confronting the health care disparity that harms the Black community. ‘this woman / this one precious, perishable kingdom’ she writes, looking death in the eye and acknowledging the fate that must befall us all.‘you might as well answer the door, my child, the truth is furiously knocking.’I first discovered Lucille Clifton 10 years back in college. Through a clerical error, my 400 level class--what it was meant to be has long been forgotten--was accidentally assigned to Women’s Studies of Modern African American Poetry. I thought something was off when I purchased my textbooks but I showed up the first day anyway. The first day we dove into Lucille Clifton andAudre Lordeand I was hooked. I had previously had an interest in poetry but not the language to describe it. After the first lecture the teacher pulled me aside, as I was not on her roster and was actually not supposed to be there but she encouraged me to remain in her course. There was a prerequisite I had not taken she said she would wave on the condition that I read the entirety ofSister Outsider: Essays and Speechesby Lorde and have a conversation with her about it at the end of the course. This class changed my life forever. It was where I really learned to love poetry, especially as we wrote intense, weekly essays dissecting specific poems. For the final assignment we were given a topic at random to research poetry about and write a 15 page paper, I was assigned poetry about miscarriage. The heart of my paper centered around Clifton’sthe lost baby poemthe time i dropped your almost body downdown to meet the waters under the cityand run one with the sewage to the seawhat did i know about waters rushing backwhat did i know about drowningor being drownedyou would have been born into winterin the year of the disconnected gasand no car 	we would have made the thinwalk over genesee hill into the canada windto watch you slip like ice into strangers’ handsyou would have fallen naked as snow into winterif you were here i could tell you theseand some other thingsif i am ever less than a mountainfor your definite brothers and sisterslet the rivers pour over my headlet the sea take me for a spillerof seas 	let black men call me strangeralways 	for your never named sakeThis poem has always stuck in my mind and I feel forever in debt to the way Lucille Clifton unlocked the language of poetry to me. It is my favorite art form and I have grown to love her work so much that I cannot think of poetry without immediately turning to her work.‘Poems come out of wonder, not out of knowing’If a collected works is daunting to you, I might recommend beginning withBlessing the Boats: New and Selected Poems, 1988-2000, Clifton’s National Book Award winning selected works. She is a towering giant in American poetry and one of the most empowering and heartfelt poets you will ever encounter. I cannot recommend her more highly and I have a true, deep love and respect for her. I’d like to leave you with a video of one of my other favorite poets,Jericho Brown, talking about and reading a poem by Lucille Clifton:https://twitter.com/tmagazine/status/...Do yourself a massive favor and read her work.5/5as the day arriveswith all its clumsy blessingswhat we will becomewaits in us like an ache.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13591815-the-collected-poems-of-lucille-clifton-1965-2010,The Collected Poems of Lucille Clifton 1965-2010.txt
Rupture Tense,"‘We, who are made and unmadeby the dark mass of the unseen.’‘I’m drawn to acts of looking,’sayspoet Jenny Xie, ‘and toward what a gaze can puncture.’ In her first collection, the Walt Whitman Award winningEye Level: Poems, she examined ‘all that is untouchable as far as the eye can reach,’ and here in her 2022 collectionThe Rupture Tenseher gaze casts a long look over the intertwinings of past, present and future, often through a camera lens that captured the Chinese Cultural Revolution and the reverberations of it still felt in her family today. The collection begins with brilliant ekphrastic poetry of the photos from Chinese journalistLi Zhensheng, who hid negatives of his photography that captured the public demonstrations and abuses during the Cultural Revolution under the floorboards of his apartment preserving them so they can be seen today, and moves into investigations of herself returning to China after decades in the United States as well as of her grandmother who would take her own life after the Revolution. With breathtaking poetry, Xie plunges us intomoments when we feel history, feeling its gaze fall upon us like a heavy weight as we gaze to the future.Li ZhenshengXie’s work often examines what she believes is that sight is ‘constructed and enabled and reinforced’ by the context around it. ‘Vision and connected forms of perception map the coordinates of what we know, while simultaneously directing our attention toward what remains unseen,’ she said in a recent ’interview. This idea takes on multiple meaningsThe Rupture Tense, particularly in the idea of historical events and the way our context is shaped by those who want to direct how we see it. Take the opening poem for example,Red Puncta, written about Li Zhensheng’s photography:By negative space, by forgetting's lining. Bybackground: fabric where things seethe. Wherefugitive looks and tung trees scrape open looseseams. In the far off, shame plants in earlobesand draws color. See how the background leaksout watery faces that haven't been rifledthrough. Such as the man in the crowd ofthousands, running his tongue over the filmscarring his teeth. Such as the woman, her fattylids betraying her drowsing. The ones fartheroff, their heads angled away, mouthing theunrecoverable. The background is milky fog, issolitary, is sight that is untold. Edge closer.Friction from the future lies in the folds.While Zhensheng’s photos captured the events of the Cultural Revolution, Xie tells us ‘a photograph is no place to keep the dead,’ and through the photos and these poems they ‘anchor’ inside the viewer/reader, a reminder of history that resonates forward. It is a reminder not to let the past repeat itself, such as inPostmemorywhen she warns ‘Nature reuses / plotlines / not wanting / to waste / a thing,’ but also that the past informs the present.(photo by Li Zhensheng)‘There are others. The brutalized. The hanged. The stoned. The lashed. The suicides. The betrayed. The paranoid. The disappeared. The executed, slender backs to the firing squad. How close Li had to stand to acquire their expressions, close enough he could smell the spume of blood and of brain matter.’This is a sharp collection that finds interesting ways to continuously circle back into it’s themes. Xie uses a variance of styles, such as a poem written as instructions to a game and gives close attention to the use of white space. Many poems leave large gaps between lines that remind us of how even with gaps in time everything is interconnected, past and present as we forge towards the future. These gaps are felt in her poems about returning to China, felt in the titular rupture tense between past tense and present tense where she finds it is ‘no surprise that I’m more verb than subject.’ Xie looks at the idea of identity that is rooted in a country that now feels forgeign to you, with all its past moving within you.Meeting PlacesThe world clangs!Death barks back in the furred dark.In the recesses of newsprintyou trace the ragged linewhere one country joinswith another by torturous stitchesand feel convulsionsalong your midpoint.The world stops clanging.Death licks at its privates.And then you turn the page.There is a lovely reflection on heritage going on here, but also the pains of feeling removed from it. ‘How can I be trustworthy with this mouth,’ she asks of being an English speaker. Luckily for us, the readers, Xie uses it to great poetic success. Shortlisted for the National Book Award,The Rupture Tenseis an outstanding collection of work that brings past, present and future alive.5/5‘When spring comes around, you carry the weight of spring.When summer comes around, you carry the weight of summer.When fall comes around, you carry the weight of fall.When winter comes around, your pages fall open.And you, all future tense, leak through.’",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59808546-rupture-tense,Rupture Tense.txt

American Sonnets for My Past and Future Assassin,"OK, you have to start with the title here.Even if you aren’t a poetry person, you have to be struck by it. It sounds as if it’s making sense even though it can’t be true at any literal level; you can’t have more than one assassin, but the grammar coheres. Then, in that verbal ambiguity, new possibilities arise: “assassin” is metaphorical, and “my” refers not just to one person but to many occupying the same position.The book turns out to be an interrogation of those possibilities while also probing the nature of “sonnets.” It’s angry, thoughtful, committed to a project of self-betterment, and full of images and turns of phrase that do remarkable things, things like the title of the book which also serves (in the singular) as the title for each of the separate 50-or-so poems here.I think there are a handful of these that work less well – a few are too gimmicky for my taste (“You don’t seem to want it” or “I cut myself on some glass”) and some seem a little too repetitive of the motifs that Hayes weaves throughout (like the “male hysteria” conceit”) – but even those tend to be redeemed by the cumulative power of the project. Many more are flat-out excellent while most of the “ordinary” ones are also effective and compelling. The result is that even those rare misfires function as part of a collection. In fact, I come eventually to wonder if they aren’t ultimately impressive as well, kind of like the squawks in a Coltrane solo – not so much errors as reminders of the technical brilliance it takes to pull off jazz at that level.This is very much a jazz collection. The purist in me protested when I first realized these “sonnets” are neither metrical nor rhymed. I got over that complaint about 12 lines into the first one, though. Hayes has intuited the rhythm of the sonnet and then seen how far he can stretch it.Here’s one example from my expanding list of great poems here:Sometimes the father almost sees lookingAt the son, how handsome he’d be if halfHis own face was made of the woman he loved.He almost sees in his boy’s face, an opennessLike a wound before it scars, who he wasLong before his name was lost, the trailTo his future on earth long before he arrived.To be dead and alive at the same time.A son finds his father handsome becauseThe son can almost see how he mightBecome superb as the scar above a wound.And because the son can see who he wasLong before he had a name, the trace ofHis future on earth long before he arrived.I’m struck by how that really is sonnet-like, not just in its layout but in its laying out of contrast. The first eight lines give us what I think is a gorgeous reflection on a father seeing a son and loving him for being shaped by the woman he loves, and then the final six reverse that, looking from the son to the father.That’s enough to make me say wow, but Hayes is full of other excellent ones. Consider these lines from “From now on I will do my laundry early Sunday: “I believe/ Eurydice is actually the poet, not Orpheus. Her muse/ Has his back to her with his ear bent to his own heart./ As if what you learn making love to yourself matters/ More than what you learn when loving someone else.”Or consider from “Our sermon today…”, “When the wound/ Is deep, the healing is heroic. Suffering and/ Ascendance require the same work. Our sermon/ Today sets the beauty of sin against the purity of dirt.” As with the book’s title, I am both bewildered by such language and drawn to it, drawn by its clarity of expression to find the ambiguity beneath it.Or from “The subject is allowed…”, “What if it were possible to make a noise so lovely/ People would pay to hear it continuously for a century/ Or so. Unbelievably, Miles Davis and John Coltrane/ Standing within inches of each other didn’t explode.”Or the first one, the one that convinced me to buy this and that points so forcefully to the nature of ambiguity at the center of the collection, “Orpheus was alone when he invented writing./ His manic drawing became a kind of writing when he sent/ His beloved a sketch of an eye with an X struck through it./ He meant I am blind without you. She thought he meant/ I never want to see you again. It is possible he meant that, too.”I’ve said all of that without touching on the political. I’ve heard this one referred to as one of the first great literary works to grapple with what the Trump moment means. That’s true in part since many of these address not just African-American history but also, implicitly, the Afro-pessimism that’s taking root in so much contemporary literature. One poem even seems to mention Trump by name – the not-as-effective-as-my-favorites “I pour a pinch of serious poison” – but I think, in the end, our current moment is incidental.This is really what jazz has always been: an improvisation that insist a single moment can make sense of everything we imagine of both “before this moment” and “after.” This is angry and beautiful, and it speaks to poets and poems who’ve helped shape its voice, but it’s ultimately something like Coltrane at his best. It’s an artist spilling it all out and finding, against all odds, that it holds together.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36479356-american-sonnets-for-my-past-and-future-assassin,American Sonnets for My Past and Future Assassin.txt
Village Prodigies,"There are few books of poetry that I can sink into with as much ease and pleasure as I sank into this one. Perhaps because this is not a collection of poems but an episodic work of fiction that employs poetry as its storytelling medium, it engaged and sustained this reader's attention from start to finish. As a lifelong poetry enthusiast with an eclectic range of aesthetic tastes, I was also impressed by the stylistic range of this work, for there is much to please the experimentalist and formalist alike, yet tone and quality are consistent. It's also a genre-bender: historical fiction in verse with a dash of sci-fi? Yes, please. Never didactic but always meaningful, never facile but always accessible, this book is more than a peek back in time. This book captures an age. (For more specific information about the book's structure, characters, and chronology, see below. I have provided a basic outline while purposefully avoiding plot spoilers.)The book follows its main character, Seth Portis, and his all-male cast of childhood friends, each one gifted in his own way. Because the book is not chronological, you get to see this group of friends at different phases of their lives, but not in the order you might predict. When we are introduced to Seth Portis in the first section of the book, he is an adult learning to cope with his aging parents, and his dementia-ridden mother in particular. In the second and shortest section of the book, we get a glimpse of an older Seth and a man named Brown, who we do not yet know, both grappling with the news that they have cancer. In the third section, we go back to Seth's childhood, at which point we meet all of his friends (which includes Brown), and the whole cast of characters is introduced rather humorously as a sort of MacCarthy-esque clique of 4th-grade boys who form a secret club in order to make mischief. In the fourth section of the book, we see these characters as young men coming of age during the Vietnam War. Next, we see the same men as young professionals who are incorporating new forms of high-tech entertainment and communication media into their lives (Facebook, videogames, and so on).Some readers may be tempted to describe this book as a novel in verse, but really it's more of a series of episodes about a group of friends. And along with the poems that deal specifically with our main cast, there are other poems interspersed that act as portraits of the men's hometown, including a few minor episodes about some of the more colorful people who live in the town. (Think Winesburg, Ohio in the rural Southeast, then throw in the Red Scare, small town racisms, Vietnam, LSD, road trips, a chicken processing plant in Mexico, and more.) One has the sense that this book might have gone on forever, giving us more and more episodes about its beloved characters, and yet the collection has a sense of completeness about it. It may well be this poet's best book to date. It certainly contains some of his best poems.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30971624-village-prodigies,Village Prodigies.txt
Bluets,"I quote whole chunks from the book. There isn’t really anything to “spoil”, per se, but if you want to go in completely blind, you have been warned.I picked this up because it was on quite a few poetry lists, hailed as a modern classic. Itisa modern classic, in my opinion, but I’m only saying that because I enjoyed the hell out of it. It isn’t, however, entirely “poetry”. It’spoetic, for sure. It’s poetic musings and gatherings of things, philosophy, art, science, readings. Such a beautiful collection of blue to deal with feeling blue, in the general sense. Not that Maggie Nelson would necessarily equate feeling blue with the emptiness and sadness that the general sense connotes. I’ll still file it under poetry. Who cares, there are no rules.Below?Les Bluetsby Joan Mitchell (1973). It inspired the name for Nelson’s 240 “pieces” in this book. If you own Lydia Davis’Essays One, you can flip to this picture and read her essay on it. I didn’t! But if you want to, it’s also online, righthere. You can let me know how it is if you do.I’ll spruce up the review with some quotes at the end, all from the book. For now, we’ll start with what Nelson starts with, right before she gets into the book, a snippet from Pascal’sPensées:“And were it true, we do not think all philosophy is worth one hour of pain.”The tribal side of me (easily activated during each and every single one of the 38 Premier League games that Arsenal play) despises blue. Red is where it should be. Reactionary, angry, sexy, seductive, alluring. The cognitive side of me (often on vacation) rests inside blue when it can. I think of music, the deep emotional crags inside of my brain,filledto the brim with blue. Indigo. Cyan. Azure. Navy. Sky. Turquoise. I think of those albums that were blue, and the blue affected everything about how they affected me. So not so cognitive, eh? Emotional. Deeply emotional. Maybe this one, John Mayer.Or this one, Jay Z.This one for SURE, Drake.The Beatles have to be there, despite this not being a studio album.Nirvana.A music list for Alan is pointless without some Red Hot Chili Peppers.This one too.An abundance of blue. It’s an important colour. Maybe the musical draw from the colour drew me to pick the book up. But it landed something fierce. I’m not currently in the state of mind that Nelson would have been in when she wrote the book, or parts of it. She was reeling from the dissolution of a romantic relationship. That’s a lazy explanation for the feeling though, as we all know it’s not a one-to-one linear relationship. The amount of her “sadness”, if you can call it that, did not make her delve even deeper into the colour.Fuck it, I won’t wait for the end to toss everything in. Here are some of the quotes I liked:27. But why bother with diagnoses at all, if a diagnosis is but a restatement of the problem?45. This pains me enormously. She presses me to say why; I can’t answer. Instead I say something about how clinical psychology forces everything we call love into the pathological or the delusional or the biologically explicable, that if what I was feeling wasn’t love then I am forced to admit that I don’t know what love is, or, more simply, that I loved a bad man. How all of these formulations drain the blue right out of love and leave an ugly, pigmentless fish flapping on a cutting board on a kitchen counter.71. I have been trying, for some time now, to find dignity in my loneliness. I have been finding this hard to do.72. It is easier, of course, to find dignity in one’s solitude. Loneliness is solitude with a problem. Can blue solve the problem, or can it at least keep me company within it?—No, not exactly. It cannot love me that way; it has no arms. But sometimes I do feel its presence to be a sort of wink—Here you are again, it says, and so am I.I adore how she puts these across. She does a bit of the music soul searching too - that’s what inspired my closer look into the musical influence on the colour (the cover art?) - she goes with Joni Mitchell’sBlue.She also works with Leonard Cohen’sFamous Blue Raincoat. We Canadians know our blue, that’s for damn sure.Rant coming up. Skip it if you want - look for the next bolded letters.As a side note, I wanted to listen to Joni Mitchell’sBluewhile reading this book, as the album was salient again due to constant mentions. I go to Spotify, I search it up, and I remember that both her and Neil Young took their discographies off of Spotify due to… what exactly? Sharing a platform with Joe Rogan? Due to ideas that he was spreading COVID misinformation? I’m no Rogan apologist (I think he’s brilliant at maintaining that many conversations with that many differing personalities, but he can be a massive idiot at times), but had they listened to a single episode of his work or was it just the classic out of context clips that go around of him being an oaf that talks about elk, BJJ, and ivermectin? Look: now millions and millions of people are a) deprived of your music and b) deprived of the chance to become acquainted with your work. Do you know the amount of inspiration and influence you are taking away from upcoming artists? Not to mention the selfish lens of the fact that your influence/legacy will be nil to ongoing generations. Spotify (unfortunately)isthat big. It isthatubiquitous.A pattern I notice with ageing: your experience grows. Of course, as experience accumulates, you may mistake this accumulation with wisdom. That would be stupid. You don’t have a god-given talent to identify patterns within this experience properly. You are welcome to speak out on it, of course. Yes, stick it to the man. I get it, trust me. Stick it to thesystem. Monopolies are bad. I have a sarcastic tone, but I do genuinely agree. I just think it’s a damn shame to be that old, have that much experience, have seen that much of the world, and still be unable to come back to a situation and potentially admit that your pride may have gotten the better of you.Listen, I’m sorry, I CANNOT believe that Joni Mitchell had even heard of this podcast prior to… seeing clips of it? Being told about it? Does Joni Mitchell even listen toanypodcasts? Come now. Do I think this was an orchestrated attempt by other music streaming services at Spotify’s stocks and chokehold on the market? Heyyyyyy now. We can talk over some coffee.“It’s a dangerous thing to mistake speaking without thought for speaking the truth, don’t you think?” says Benoit Blanc. I love that quote. Let’s not forget that quote before taking sensationalist stances. Fucking hell, Joni Mitchell, look what you’ve made me type out in my review. As for your music… shit, I’m not going out of my way to buy it. Don’t it always seem to go that you don’t know what you got ‘til it’s gone?Rant done. I needed to get that out.I’m rambling - I don’t have a coherent point. I just want to say that “this was good”. I also want to say that because it was good, “I liked it”. That’s it, really, isn’t it? Here are the rest of the sections I liked.121. “Clearness is so eminently one of the characteristics of truth, that often it even passes for truth itself,” wrote Joseph Joubert, the French “man of letters” who recorded countless such fragments in notebooks for forty years in preparation for a monumental work of philosophy that he never wrote. I know all about this passing for truth. At times I think it quite possible that it lies, as if a sleight of hand, at the heart of all my writing.134. It calms me to think of blue as the color of death. I have long imagined death’s approach as the swell of a wave—a towering wall of blue. You will drown, the world tells me, has always told me. You will descend into a blue underworld, blue with hungry ghosts, Krishna blue, the blue faces of the ones you loved. They all drowned, too. To take a breath of water: does the thought panic or excite you? If you are in love with red then you slit or shoot. If you are in love with blue you fill your pouch with stones good for sucking and head down to the river. Any river will do.135. Of course one can have “the blues” and stay alive, at least for a time. “Productive,” even (the perennial consolation!). See, for example, “Lady Sings the Blues”: “She’s got them bad / She feels so sad / Wants the world to know / Just what her blues is all about.” Nonetheless, as Billie Holiday knew, it remains the case that to see blue in deeper and deeper saturation is eventually to move toward darkness.184. Writing is, in fact, an astonishing equalizer. I could have written half of these propositions drunk or high, for instance, and half sober; I could have written half in agonized tears, and half in a state of clinical detachment. But now that they have been shuffled around countless times—now that they have been made to appear, at long last, running forward as one river—how could either of us tell the difference?198. In a 1994 interview, about twenty years after he wrote “Famous Blue Raincoat,” Cohen admitted that he could no longer remember the specifics of the love triangle that the song describes. “I always felt that there was an invisible male seducing the woman I was with, now whether this one was incarnate or merely imaginary I don’t remember.” I find this forgetting quite heartening and quite tragic, in turns.203. I remember, in the eighties, when crack first hit the scene, hearing all kinds of horror stories about how if you smoked it even once, the memory of its unbelievable high would live on in your system forever, and you would thus never again be able to be content without it. I have no idea if this is true, but I will admit that it scared me off the drug. In the years since, I have sometimes found myself wondering if the same principle applies in other realms—if seeing a particularly astonishing shade of blue, for example, or letting a particularly potent person inside you, could alter you irrevocably, just to have seen or felt it. In which case, how does one know when, or how, to refuse? How to recover?233. That the future is unknowable is, for some, God’s means of suturing us in, or to, the present moment. For others, it is the mark of a malevolence, a sure sign that our entire existence here is best understood as a sort of joke or mistake.234. For me, it is neither. It is simply the way that it is. Whether this accident be a happy or unhappy one is probably more a matter of mood than anything else; the difficulty is that “our moods do not believe in each other” (Emerson). One can wander about the landscape looking for clues, amassing evidence, but even the highest pile never seems to decide the case.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6798263-bluets,Bluets.txt
Theogony / Works and Days,"This 1920s translation by Hugh Evelyn-White, now in the public domain, seems okay. A couple of widely-available audio versions of Hesiod, free, or on Scribd subscription, use it. I listened toTheogonyand ended up reading along while listening toWorks & Days, because it had the sort of detailed new material that I find easier to absorb in writing.TheogonyIn Evelyn-White'sTheogonythere are phrases that are less than clear if you don't already know all the details, e.g. making it sound like Athene was destined to have two children, a girl Tritogenia, and a son - but this information refers to her mother Metis, and Tritogenia is another name for Athene. Or that any sacrifice and prayer was of interest to Hecate, as if it implicitly means those to all other deities too; was that part of the lore?Victorian-style vocab sometimes seems merely quaint, e.g. ""shapely-ankled Alcmene"", but the choice to call Cronos' father Uranus ""Heaven"" is plain confusing. (Was the latter due to avoidance of double entendres and the tedium of snickering students after years as a don?) Use of words like this with strong Christian association also leads to ideas which either jar, or highlight huge differences in culture, or both, depending on perspective, e.g. ""Heaven rejoiced in his evil doing"". This isn't the first time in the last few months that I've seen the word ""sin"" used in a Classical text, and yet this is never accompanied by discussion of the original words and how the meanings and significance differed. Perhaps a different word would avoid that baggage, but might be burdensome for scansion.Hesiod, along with Homer, is the oldest written source on Greek mythology and religion, and, you will probably read Hesiod when already familiar with most of the stories; it sometimes confirms, sometimes adds variation, to versions well-known these days. (Such as Ariadne becoming the wife of Dionysus.) There are genealogies of deities and heroes rarely referenced now, and the effect is rather like the paragraphs of 'begats' in the Bible.Some of the most interesting phrases and stories:- at the beginning, the Muses wash at ""the Horse’s Spring"" before beginning their song and dance to Zeus and Hera - which you can read as echoing the sacredness of horses to the Indo-European religion from which the Greek branched off, and which is far more evident in theRig Veda. (I assume that as Greece was not as well-suited to riding as regions with greater continuous expanses of relatively flat land, that the cult of horses ended up less prominent there.) Pegasus is mentioned here, but almost in passing, as springing from the head of Medusa and bringing thunder and lightning to Zeus.- ""as pitiless as bronze"" - I think this is also in Homer, but it's always a tingly reminder of just how old the material from these texts is, that bronze, not iron, is the byword for this. ""Rosy-fingered dawn"", so familiar from the Odyssey, is also used.- Before Zeus freed his uncles from Cronos, Earth had hidden thunder and lightning - arguably correlates with the idea of a golden age as found inWorks & Days?- Quite a disquisition on the goddess Echidna. Perhaps those who named the creature had read Hesiod and this is why the name stood out more than those of other deities who are rarely mentioned elsewhere. (Though there might well be references in other later texts I don't know, and the animal has now become *the* meaning of the name so it's unlikely to be used of the goddess in casual recent references.)- ""Epimetheus who from the first was a mischief to men who eat bread"" - perhaps, like the Golden Age, a folkloric memory of a time before agriculture, though 2700 years ago there must have been travellers around who'd encountered societies who were still foraging and hunting.- I had thought of Prometheus' theft of fire and gift of it to man as a separate story from the creation of Pandora as the first woman. But here Pandora (unnamed) is part of the price of fire - similar to the connection of Eve with the knowledge from the Serpent in Eden, and the proximate geography, both from the East Mediterranean, must mean a common root. (Which I would have thought would have been discussed more in popular sources from a historical viewpoint, because it's the kind of interesting comparative mythology that usually is; it's not even in Wikipedia, and associative passages in classic feminist texts are the main other places I've seen Eve and Pandora discussed together.)- Plutus, god of wealth is the son of Demeter. Which fits with the classical elemental association of wealth with earth, but I hadn't heard it before.Works & DaysI love literature that ends up being a source on pre-modern agriculture. My favourite parts ofAnna Kareninawere the farming scenes (and I didn't much like the rest of it). So of course I findWorks and Daysfascinating and would give it five stars because of that - though I'm a bit wary of actually doing so in case that were read as support of everything in it.It was even more interesting coming to this a couple of days after finishingPiers Plowman. Firstly it has the sort of detailed content about the agricultural year that I always used to think (before actually reading the whole thing) would be a big part of Langland's work, which actually focuses a great deal more on Christianity. And secondly, both authors, who seem to be from freeborn families of modest means, rant about other people's irresponsible behaviour and prescribe what they should do. They make a few identical points, such as, in Evelyn-White's version of Hesiod: ""for Hunger is altogether a meet comrade for the sluggard. Both gods and men are angry with a man who lives idle"". It is easy to see Hesiod and Langland as earlier examples of a familiar contemporary figure, the opinionated, conservative middle-aged man from the upper working or entrepreneurial middle class. A.E. Stallings, in the introduction to her translation ofWorks & Dayscalls Hesiod a curmudgeon, and I have to agree this is a good word for the both of them.Though Hesiod can seem more like his modern counterpart, because his practical material concerns are closer to day-to-day thinking now, than is the strenuous self-denial that was the ideal of medieval Christianity. There wasn't a conflict between religion and wealth to square:""Through work men grow rich in flocks and substance, and working they are much better loved by the immortals.Though I'm sure that in the Middle Ages, there were also those who'd have agreed with opinions like, ""Little concern has he with quarrels and courts who has not a year’s victuals laid up betimes, even that which the earth bears, Demeter’s grain. When you have got plenty of that, you can raise disputes and strive to get another’s goods."" One can see a forerunner of 20th century American financial advice books likeThe Richest Man in BabylonandThe Millionaire Next Door:- ""He who adds to what he has, will keep off bright-eyed hunger; for if you add only a little to a little and do this often, soon that little will become great.""; ""It will not always be summer, build barns.""- an aim is to be in the position ""so you may buy another’s holding and not another yours"" (this relates to propitiating the gods)- This type of curmudegeonly conservative business owner of course doesn't like to pay staff when they're not useful, and doesn't want those with other responsibilities that might get in the way: ""And so soon as you have safely stored all your stuff indoors, I bid you put your bondman out of doors and look out for a servant-girl with no children;—for a servant with a child to nurse is troublesome.""So apparently labourers were out on their ear in autumn, unless they had employers who were wealthy and/or kind enough to feed them year round. Which you'd think would make sense and improve loyalty, and would mean the same good workers would be there next year? Especially if you were concerned with finding high-quality experienced staff: ""a brisk fellow of forty years ... who will attend to his work and drive a straight furrow and is past the age for gaping after his fellows."" There are undoubtedly social history papers on this labour pattern in Greece, which I've not read - I'm just extrapolating, and thinking about the more recent early modern West European system of hiring fairs and year-and-a-day contracts, you shouldn't take it as a substitute for actual research.- The manner of Hesiod's ambivalence about children, which he considers from a personal practical point of view, is a good fit for the contemporary manosphere: on the one hand they are extra mouths to feed; on the other they maybe a useful support in old age.- This was a world with hardly any public services, so self-reliance was a necessity and not just a preference: ""And look after the dog with jagged teeth; do not grudge him his food, or some time the Day-sleeper[robbers]may take your stuff.""As in most old religious texts, there is a trust in moral forces that wouldn't have been borne out in the world (here, unlike in Christian works, it isn't overtly said that the reward will be in the afterlife):Neither famine nor disaster ever haunt men who do true justice; but light-heartedly they tend the fields which are all their care.I understand that it's considered unresolved, the extent to which Hesiod's Golden Age is a folk memory of a pre-agricultural foraging society. Since I first read that, I've become aware of how many thousands of years oral legends about volcanoes and earthquakes persisted in indigenous societies (including Australia and America), and how those correlated with archaeological findings, I would now come down on the side that yes, the Golden Age, Eden and so forth *are* folk memories. These, especially in Hesiod, were recorded when writing was still relatively new and so oral tradition would have been stronger at the time. As with the story of Eden, the gods made work harder for the Greeks, and there is a sense that an alternative way of life exists/ed, but is not moral or appropriate now: ""For the gods keep hidden from men the means of life. Else you would easily do work enough in a day to supply you for a full year even without working; soon would you put away your rudder over the smoke, and the fields worked by ox and sturdy mule would run to waste.""Interestingly, the Greeks' Golden Age included herding, as did the society their religion and language originated from (seeThe Horse, the Wheel & Language: ""They dwelt in ease and peace upon their lands with many good things, rich in flocks and loved by the blessed gods.""Work seems to be a way to the gods, in Hesiod's view (nearly 2000 years before Protestantism): ""between us and Goodness the gods have placed the sweat of our brows: long and steep is the path that leads to her, and it is rough at the first; but when a man has reached the top, then is she easy to reach, though before that she was hard.""Years after I first read about Hesiod as the originator of the terms, I still find it amazing that the idea of the Bronze Age and Iron Age are actually themselves 2700 years old. In theTheogonya sickle is made of flint - an understanding of how it was done in ages past - but probably also still was by some other societies Greeks had encountered.But the most fascinating stuff, to me, is hearing, from someone writing nearly 3000 years ago, how people lived with the seasons then - and also, as I'm used to hearing about the agricultural cycle from early modern North-West European sources, how timing was a bit different due to the climate.Mark, when you hear the voice of the crane who cries year by year from the clouds above, for she give the signal for ploughing and shows the season of rainy winter.But if you plough the good ground at the solstice, you will reap sitting, grasping a thin crop in your hand, binding the sheaves awry, dust-covered, not glad at all; so you will bring all home in a basket and not many will admire you. Yet the will of Zeus who holds the aegis is different at different times; and it is hard for mortal men to tell it; for if you should plough late, you may find this remedy—when the cuckoo first calls in the leaves of the oak and makes men glad all over the boundless earth, if Zeus should send rain on the third day and not cease until it rises neither above an ox’s hoof nor falls short of it, then the late-plougher will vie with the early.When Zeus has finished sixty wintry days after the solstice, then the star Arcturus leaves the holy stream of Ocean and first rises brilliant at dusk. After him the shrilly wailing daughter of Pandion, the swallow(So swallows arrived much earlier, in March)Set your slaves to winnow Demeter’s holy grain, when strong Orion first appears, on a smooth threshing-floor in an airy place. Then measure it and store it in jars.(Unlike in the Norse Eddas and sagas, where it's acknowledged that the high-born might end up as slaves if captured, and some slave characters have names, any mentions of slaves by Hesiod are only as tools; there seems to be a sharp divide; they are *other* and not really talked about as people.But a parallel with the Norse, on another subject: Zeus is here described as ""the all-wise"".)Along with this is advice similar to that found in early modern almanacs (which depending on your perspective is wonderful social history, amusing and/ or silly and irrelevant), on auspicious and inauspicious days for various activities and also births, and various mundane topics. Though the almanacs didn't, so far as I know, include so much advice on where and where not to piss (or 'make water' in Evelyn-White's prim old vocab); it seems to imply that even many homes in Hesiod's time and place might not have designated locations. Some phrases raise more questions: ""Take nothing to eat or to wash with from uncharmed pots, for in them there is mischief."" Might charms have been said over pots when they were cleaned? Sometimes Hesiod states the obvious, but old texts often leave out other things obvious to people of their time and which did not need to be stated.After finding Epicurus'The Nature of Things, also translated by Stallings, a slog, I'd become more hesitant about reading Hesiod, despite my interest in it. The audio, and the brevity of the public domain version (without more supplementary material) helped break through that, reminding me just how short the text is and I hope to read at least one other version.(January 2021)",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27418.Theogony_Works_and_Days,Theogony  Works and Days.txt

Στα ανθρώπινα ποιήματα, όπως και αλλού σποραδικά , υπάρχει ο μόχθος των εργατών , υπάρχει κάπου ο ύμνος των Μπολσεβίκων , υπάρχει μια σταδιακή εγκατάλειψη στην κούραση.Είναι πολλαπλές οι στιχουργικές στιγμές που ο Βαλιεχο ξαφνιάζει , εκπλήσσει , τόσο με τον σουρεαλισμό πριν τον σουρεαλισμό οσό και με τον πλούτο του εφιαλτικου του φαντασιακου.

Green Eggs and Ham,"I have indeed always very much lovedGreen Eggs and Ham, as both Dr. Seuss' poetic, rhythmic text and his accompanying illustrations are both entertaining and enchanting (a sweet delight, with movement, joy and exuberant silliness). And yet, the presented underlying message ofGreen Eggs and Hamalso shows a basic and important, necessary truth (to not simply and categorically insist that one does not enjoy a certain food, but to actually try it first, that one needs to at least taste a food before making a decision as to whether one likes it or not). That being said, I can also to a point appreciate that some individuals might well consider Sam-I-Am massively annoying, and even bordering on the offensive, with his continuous insisting, basically hounding if not actually stalking the other nameless character until he finally gives up and resignedly tries Sam's green eggs and ham. Thus, while I personally do very much adoreGreen Eggs and Hamand cherish the message of trying different foods that Dr. Seuss is trying to convey, I also do comprehend that for some, Sam-I-Am is at best tedious and a bit like a recurring mosquito annoyingly buzzing around one's ear.But actually, for my adult and educated self, for my language teacher/instructor self, the genius ofGreen Eggs and Hamactually now seems to lie NOT so much in the message of the presented narrative, but in Dr. Seuss' poetic, repetitive text in at of itself, in a text that with fun and rhythm introduces children to important tenets of English grammar and word usage (different verb forms, prepositions and negation are prominently featured inGreen Eggs and Hamand by repeating the author's words or by having them read aloud, children learn, children become accustomed to proper preposition usage, the differences between the future and the present tenses of verbs, modal verbs such as ""can"" and ""should"" and the position of the negative). A wonderful, marvellous combination of enjoyment and didactic intent, and highly recommended for both in-class and at home practice/use, and absolutely outstanding for ESL instruction (case in point, in grade four, after my family had immigrated from Germany to Canada, my homeroom teacher usedGreen Eggs and Hamwith me and it definitely made learning English verbs and the many different prepositions much easier and also much more fun to both learn and remember). And not just for children either, as I have also used theGreen Eggs and Hamas a fun introductory activity for novice adult ESL learners with lasting and successful results (with the caveat to NOT ONLY use material primarily meant and designated for children with adult learners, but that as a quick activity,Green Eggs and Hamis an enjoyable, teachable interlude).",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23772.Green_Eggs_and_Ham,Green Eggs and Ham.txt

The Giving Tree,"The Giving Tree, Shel SilversteinThe Giving Tree is a children's picture book written and illustrated by Shel Silverstein. First published in 1964 by Harper & Row, it has become one of Silverstein's best known titles and has been translated into numerous languages.The book follows the lives of an apple tree and a boy, who develop a relationship with one another. The tree is very ""giving"" and the boy evolves into a ""taking"" teenager, a middle-aged man, and finally an elderly man. Despite the fact that the boy ages in the story, the tree addresses the boy as ""Boy"" his entire life.In his childhood, the boy enjoys playing with the tree, climbing her trunk, swinging from her branches, carving ""Me + T (Tree)"" into the bark, and eating her apples.However, as the boy grows older, he spends less time with the tree and tends to visit her only when he wants material items at various stages of his life, or not coming to the tree alone (such as bringing a lady friend to the tree and carving ""Me +Y.L."" (her initials, often assumed to be an acronym for ""young love"")) into the tree.In an effort to make the boy happy at each of these stages, the tree gives him parts of herself, which he can transform into material items, such as money (from her apples), a house (from her branches), and a boat (from her trunk).With every stage of giving, ""the Tree was happy"". ...تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز چهاردهم ماه می سال 2009میلادیعنوان: درخت بخشنده؛ نویسنده: شل سیلورستاین؛ مترجم: سیما مجیدزاده؛ مشهد، گل آفتاب، 1383 در 55ص؛ شابک 9645599326؛ چاپ هفتم 1388؛ چاپ دهم 1392، شابک 9789645599322؛ موضوع داستانهای خیال انگیز از نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 20ممترجم: هایده کروبی؛ تهران، انتشارات فنی ایران، 1385، در 36ص؛ شابک: 9643891739؛مترجم: مونا ماشی؛ تهران، ماشی، 1387، در یک جلد؛ شابک 9786009060184؛مترجم: کمال برزگر بفرویی؛ قم، فراکاما، 1390، در 52ص؛ شابک9786009241309؛مترجم: امیرحسین مهدی زاده؛ تهران، نشر نو، آسیم، 1392، در 58ص؛ شابک9789647443784؛مترجم: کمال مرادی؛ تهران، پلک، 1392، در 104ص؛ شابک9789642862290؛مترجم: صفورا نراقی؛ تهران، البرز فر دانش، 1393 ، در 44ص؛ شابک9786002022622؛مترجم: هرمز ریاحی؛ تهران، انتشارات خروس، 1391 ، در 58ص؛ شابک9786009453924؛سیلور استاین، نام آوری خویش را به عنوان نویسنده ی ادبیات کودکان؛ مدیون همین کتاب است؛ داستانی درباره: یکی که میبخشد، و دیگری که میستاند؛ داستان در مورد درختی ست که «سایه»، «میوه»، «شاخه» و حتی «کنده اش» باعث شادی پسرکی میشودمتن داستان درخت بخشنده و مهربانروزی روزگاری درختی بود ….؛ و پسر کوچولویی را دوست میداشت؛ پسرک هر روز میآمد، برگهایش را جمع میکرد؛ از آنها تاج میساخت، و شاه جنگل میشد؛ از تنه اش بالا میرفت؛ از شاخه هایش آویزان میشد، و تاب میخورد، و سیب میخورد؛ با هم قایم باشک بازی میکردند؛ پسرک هر وقت خسته میشد زیر سایه اش میخوابید؛ او درخت را خیلی دوست میداشت؛ خیلی زیاد؛ و درخت خوشحال بود؛ اما زمان میگذشت؛ پسرک بزرگ میشد؛ و درخت بیشتر تنها بود؛ تا یک روز پسرک نزد درخت آمد؛ درخت گفت: «بیا پسر، ازتنه ام بالا بیا، و با شاخه هایم تاب بخور، سیب بخور، و در سایه ام بازی کن، و خوشحال باش.»؛ پسرک گفت: «من دیگر بزرگ شده ام، بالا رفتن و بازی کردن، کار من نیست؛ میخواهم چیزی بخرم، و سرگرمی داشته باشم؛ من به پول احتیاج دارم؛ میتوانی کمی پول به من بدهی؟»؛ درخت گفت: «متاسفم، من پولی ندارم»؛ من تنها برگ و سیب دارم؛ سیبهایم را به شهر ببر بفروش؛ آن وقت پول خواهی داشت، و خوشحال خواهی شد؛ پسرک از درخت بالا رفت؛ سیبها را چید و برداشت و رفت؛ درخت خوشحال شد؛ اما پسرک دیگر تا مدتها بازنگشت …؛ و درخت غمگین بود؛ تا یکروز پسرک برگشت؛ درخت از شادی تکان خورد؛ و گفت «بیا پسر، از تنه ام بالا بیا، با شاخه هایم تاب بخور، و خوشحال باش»؛ پسرک گفت: «آنقدر گرفتارم که فرصت بالا رفتن از درخت را ندارم، زن و بچه میخواهم، و به خانه احتیاج دارم؛ میتوانی به من خانه بدهی؟»؛ درخت گفت: «من خانه ای ندارم؛ خانه ی من جنگل است؛ ولی تو میتوانی شاخه هایم را ببری؛ و برای خود خانه ای بسازی و خوشحال باشی»؛ آنوقت پسرک شاخه های درختش را برید و برد، تا برای خود خانه ای بسازد؛ و درخت خوشحال بود؛ اما پسرک دیگر تا مدتها بازنگشت؛ و وقتی برگشت، درخت چنان خوشحال شد، که زبانش بند آمد؛ با اینحال به زحمت زمزمه کنان گفت: «بیا پسر، بیا و بازی کن»؛ پسرک گفت: «دیگر آنقدر پیر و افسرده شده ام، که نمیتوانم بازی کنم؛ قایقی میخواهم، که مرا از اینجا ببرد، به جایی دور، میتوانی به من قایق بدهی؟؛ درخت گفت: «تنه ام را قطع کن و برای خود قایقی بساز؛ آن وقت میتوانی با قایقت از اینجا دور شوی؛ و خوشحال باشی»؛ پسر تنه ی درخت را قطع کرد؛ قایقی ساخت، و سوار بر آن از آنجا دور شد؛ و درخت خوشحال بود؛ پس از زمانی دراز، پسرک بار دیگر بازگشت، خسته، تنها و غمگین؛ درخت پرسید «چرا غمگینی؟ ای کاش میتوانستم کمکت کنم؛ اما دیگر نه سیب دارم، نه شاخه، حتی سایه هم ندارم برای پناه دادن به تو»؛ پسر گفت: «خسته ام از این زندگی، بسیار خسته و تنهام؛ و فقط نیازمند با تو بودن هستم، آیا میتوانم کنارت بنشینم؟»؛ درخت خوشحال شد، و پسرک پیر، کنار درخت نشست، و در کنار هم زندگی کردند؛ و سالیان سال، در غم و شادی به زندگی ادامه دادند؛ …)؛ پایاندوستان خوبم، آیا شرح داستان، چیزی به یاد ما نمیآورد؟ بیشتر ما شبیه پسرک همین داستان هستیم، و با مادر، و پدر خود، چنین رفتاری داریم؛ درخت همان مادر و پدر ماهاست، تا وقتی کوچکیم، دوست داریم با آنها بازی کنیم؛ سپس تنهایشان میگذاریم، و دوباره زمانی به سویشان برمیگردیم، که نیازمند هستیم و گرفتار، برای مادر و پدر خود، وقت نداریم، آیا تا به حال به این فکر کرده ایم، که مادر و پدر، برای ما همه چیز را فراهم میکنند، تا ما را شاد نگاه دارند، و با مهربانی چاره ای برای رفع مشکلمان، پیدا میکنند، و تنها چیزی که در عوض از ما میخواهند، این است که تنهایشان نگذاریم؛ به مادر خود عشق بورزیم، و به پدر، احترام بگذاریم، فراموششان نکنیم؛ برایشان زمان اختصاص دهیم؛ همراهیشان کنیم؛ شادی آنها در دیدن روی ماهاست؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 17/06/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 20/05/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/370493.The_Giving_Tree,The Giving Tree.txt
Miss Mary Mack: A Hand-Clapping Rhyme,"1. Due to many versions of this story, I could not find any awards for this specific book.2. This book is appropriate from grades Pre-K to Second Grade.3. Miss Mary Mack by Mary Ann Hoberman is a zany story and song about a girl named Miss Mary Mack who asks her mom for fifty cents to see an elephant jump over a fence. The elephant jumped so high that he didn't land from the jump until the Fourth of July. When he landed, he fell right into Miss Mary Mack's backyard and she was able to convince the elephant to keep him.4. This song/book is one of the more catchier songs from my childhood. The story is absolutely ridiculous and will definitely make younger children laugh. The nostalgia that I associate with this book/song definitely makes it worthwhile, although it can have the tendency to get annoying.5. I would use this book in the classroom to teach children how to identify rhymes. Since this book is a song, I would sing it and have my students clap every time they hear a rhyme. I would also use this book in an unconventional way in which I would read/sing the book backward with my students to show that rhymes are interchangeable.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/133678.Miss_Mary_Mack,Miss Mary Mack A Hand-Clapping Rhyme.txt

Chicka Chicka Boom Boom,"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom is an incredibly deep commentary on human instincts, written superbly by the great Bill Martin Jr. At the beginning of the story, we meet our protagonist, ""A"", who's goal is to beat all the other letters to the top of the coconut tree. What I enjoy the most about Bill Martin Jr's novel is how it doesn't waste any time. As soon as A is introduced, we're immediately shown his motivations and his end goal, without any dillydallying. He is a simple character with a simple mission, and because of this, a backstory or other form of overly long character background check isn't necessary. Martin Jr is well aware of this, and introduces A accordingly. We meet other characters as the story goes along, such as B and C for example. They all have great personalities, but fall somewhat short to the incredible character achievement that is A. However, a lot of them have distinct character traits that make them interesting, such as Loose-Tooth T.The book's main conflict occurs when all the lowercase letters of the alphabet, (who are geniusly portrayed as children) try to be the first to make it to the top of the iconic tree, but end up falling and injuring themselves, having to be helped by their parents. This is the message that a lot of reviewers are failing to see. The letters are just like us. As a species, humans are captivated with the idea of pushing farther and farther, but never stop to think if we should, whether it will harm us in the long run or not. We are lowercase letters, obsessed with climbing further and further up the coconut tree. And eventually, it will be too late. We'll fall. But unlike the lowercases, we won't have uppercase letters to come save us. It's up to us and us alone to decide whether or not we choose to climb the coconut tree.Despite all this, at the end of the book we're shown A sitting firmly at the top of the tree after all the other letters had gone home. This gave me a lot of mixed feelings. Yes, it was a fitting end to A's character arc, as he completed his goal and went through the hero's journey. However, it also gave me a bit of sadness. It's slightly depressing that A is so obsessed with getting to the top of the tree, that he does so in the middle of the night, with no on around to see him. Some might say this is just dedication, and shows A's determination, (one of his defining character traits) but I find it somewhat disheartening. This is another genius hint at the book's deeper meaning by Bill Martin Jr.Chicka Chicka Boom Boom is a book about society. About human beings. About life. It saddens me that some might even think to give Bill Martin Jr's bestseller one star, because it means that they clearly didn't see the books deeper meaning. Or perhaps, they're too scared to look for it.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/293595.Chicka_Chicka_Boom_Boom,Chicka Chicka Boom Boom.txt
Llama Llama Red Pajama,"Years ago I used to work at Barnes and Noble as the Children's Lead. As such, one of my duties was to do story time on Saturday mornings. I cant tell you how many various children's books I read, and I honestly don't remember many reactions. For the most part I read a story and moved on to the next, only noting when one was an utter miss so I didn't read it again.This was the only one that had an extreme enough of a positive reaction that I recall it vividly. I pulled out the book and suddenly some 30 or so children lost their minds and I suddenly felt like a rock star on a stage… if the entire fan base was five and under.I picked it up again recently for my daughter, and it is once again repeating. We've read it five nights in a row now, and every time she gets so excited to hear it. If you have a young child in your life, make sure you give this one a try as it seems to be a consistent hit. 4/5 stars",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/401679.Llama_Llama_Red_Pajama,Llama Llama Red Pajama.txt
"One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish","One book, two book, red book, blue book...what a wonderful year it has been for reading! Instead of my normal book review, I thought I would use this last book review of the year to reflect on the year of reading. 2019 proved the old adage that the best investments are in old books and old friends. Since I consider books I've read before as old friends, it was a good year indeed!The best of my re-reads included Murakami Haruki's Sputnik Sweetheart and Norwegian Wood. My own book ""The Underground Novel"", my satirical self-help novel, which I finished last year. Tales from the Irish Club by my old English teacher Lester Goran, the writing of Henry David Thoreau. I haven't decided what I will re-read next year, but shockingly that might include a biography of Elon Musk.That brings me to my biggest surprise of the year: a biography of Elon Musk. Though the writing was not a literary masterpiece, the subject matter was enthralling. So much so that I had to reflect on a simple question: Do I love biographies as a genre? It appears I do. One of my favorite books is a biography of Orson Welles. Thus, next year I'll do everything I can to lay my hands on more biographies.2019 was also a year of science. I read no less than three science books, my worst subject and enjoyed each of them. One of these books might find it onto my re-read list. One of the difficult things about reading science is that my critical blinkers are often turned off. I'm not sure how to engage these books in book reviews other than to note their value as entertainment, the accessibility, and their ability to motivate me to read other science books. Still, I'm not deterred. I will read at least one science book next year.2019 was also the year of ""The Boys"". I finally finished the comic book series I started when I was in graduate school. Why? I had to. I couldn't have the series ruined for me by things people were saying about the Amazon series. (I'm sure the Amazon series is fine, but I will always think of the series as something inspired by Bush-era silliness).The biggest disappointment this year: The big-think books. Nicholas Nassim Taleb is still a dazzling philosopher, but his newest book seems to see him indulge in his worst habits (picking petty fights with people who seem to annoy him on social media) rather than deepening and enriching his philosophy. At this point too, I seemed to have become able to anticipate what will be written in any given chapters (though to his credit he still has some surprises, read the section on -- How the Intolerant Minority wins!); 7 Habits of Successful People was a minor bust; The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck and Essentialism were good books, but their usefulness for me was limited. I had already gotten their messages a long time ago. Alas, there was not a big ""rethink"" moment for me in 2019.Perhaps that means I'm just getting older and my reading is leading to a wiser life. Perhaps the big-think moments are actually in the genre of biography, not big think books. Actually, I'm pretty sure that's it.Having written all this, what is my take away for reading in 2020. Well, less but better. 30 books is fine for 2020 if they are the right ones. Spend more time vetting my books. Don't just pick up something because it seems convenient at the moment. It's hard to do, but it will pay off in the end.""I took the long way to choosing a book,"" I will write at the end of 2020, and I was all the better for it.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7770.One_Fish_Two_Fish_Red_Fish_Blue_Fish,"One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish.txt"
Fox in Socks,"This is a buddy cop story about one down-on-his-luck, jaded old detective named Knox and a scrappy new deputy named Fox. Fox is the sort of guy who travels the whole world with nothing on his feet but socks. Knox is the kind you box in.Fox points out early on how Knox puts himself in a box at the station. Knox responds by trying to get Fox in the same box. Fox responds by trying to get Knox to parade around the world in nothing but blue socks like himself. Knox ignores him.So to get his attention, Officer Fox gets a whole bunch of chicks to come. Some are time bound type-A chicks. Some are creative, almost childish block building types. Others are blue collar brick layers. Fox tries to get Knox to let at least one of these chicks turn a trick for him.Covering their blue collar and creative shifts at work, Fox gives the chicks time with Knox. Knox doesn't really respond to all of this, so Fox tries to get involved with the chicks too. Knox tells him he'd rather have a bedroom full of bricks than chicks, for all the good it does his detective work. He begs Fox off.Who apologizes.Then brings a single girl named Sue onto the crime scene, herself wearing socks and no shoes like a little fae creature. She's the kind of girl who does her own sewing.""See?"" Fox asks Knox.Knox admits it's a rather difficult thing to do one's own sewing. But he waits too long.Who comes? Crow comes. Slow Joe Crow comes. He's the kind of guy that can sew too and so he and Sue swap sewing. Fox tries to distract her by getting her to sew his sox and stay in the department.But meanwhile, Slow Joe Crow catches Knox and sews him into that box he's built for himself. It's even worse now. Sue retaliates by sewing Slow Joe Crow's rose to him.Knox gets tired of this and tries to go on a holiday.Fox crashes it by taking him to this environmental disaster, this superfund site where the water of the river has turned to blue goo. Even the geese are eating the stuff. Fox, the naive youngster, encourages Knox to try some.Knox sees it for what it is: poison. So he bails.Fox at this point is sultry, but isn't showing it. He's keeping his outward sunny disposition but tries this passive aggressive tactic of pointing to another duo, another team, another set of buddy cops in the department. Bim and Ben. These guys are the servants of the entire police force — the ""serve"" you so seldom see in the ""protect and serve;"" not to mention how seldom we also see the ""protect"" bit. Anyways, when Bim and Ben aren't filing paperwork or patrolling the streets, these guys literally sweep all the floors before janitorial shifts begin. So much so that they even break their brooms with all of the sweeping. They rally the pigs to play in two separate bands, both percussive, but one's more of a drumline and the other more of a xylophone squad.Knox isn't impressed. He sees through the comparison and doesn't care: he doesn't want a buddy or to be a buddy cop.Fox does it again with another duo, Luke and Duck. These two lick clean water straight out of a single source aquifer nearby, in contrast with the superfund site from earlier. Knox doesn't buy this eaither and they spend time staring at each other eating cheese while the breeze blows through the flea infested trees.Their talk's interrupted by a gang known as the Tweetle Beetles. Rather dumb name for a gang, considering the rest, but they start battling it with fists, then escalate to paddles, they end up in this warehouse-sized bottle they fill with muddled water. There's a French poodle that prefers Italian food. I'm only assuming the poodle's name is Shakespeare, because only a Romeo and Juliet opera would make sense of that poodle cameo at that point.Knox is so fed up with all the passive aggression and the new energy of Fox that he throws him to the gang and locks the bottle warehouse.Weirdest buddy cop novel ever, but there's a nice rhythm to it.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/105551.Fox_in_Socks,Fox in Socks.txt
The Llama Who Had No Pajama: 100 Favorite Poems,"""The Llama Who Had No Pajama"" is an anthology of 100 favorite poems by Mary Ann Hoberman. The poems really focus on different topics and aspects of learning, such as seasons, animals, rhyme, nature, letters, opposite, etc. I would have really enjoyed this book of children poetry if I didn't sit down in one sitting and read through the whole book all at once. Some of these poems are really serious and they can become a life lesson to children. Children can really connect with this book because all the poem should have similar qualities in their life such as celebrating birthdays, swinging on the swings, and so many more themes. I found the illustrations to be very well done and they will absolutely attract the reader 's attention. An appropriate grade level for this book would be first grade through fourth grade. An activity I could accomplish with children would be easy and fun once I pick one specific poem. For example, if I picked a poem about rhyme, I can make rhyming clip cards. A big image would take up most of the card, such as ""bee"" followed by a picture of a bee. There would be two-three other words with pictures located on the bottom. For example, ""car"", ""lamb"", ""key"", the child will then take a clothespin and pin it on the image that rhymes with the bee. Another activity I could accomplish with children would be picking the poem about nature. I would take the children on a nature walk and they can pick up acorns, leaves, rocks, etc. Once we arrive back at the classroom we can sort all of the objects and explore and learn about every once the children found interesting.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/401900.The_Llama_Who_Had_No_Pajama,The Llama Who Had No Pajama 100 Favorite Poems.txt
It's Raining Pigs and Noodles,"Two of my favorite poems are in this book. I Ate a Tooth this Morning, and I'm Stuck Inside a Seashell.Summary: I Ate a Tooth this Morning is about a girl who sat down for breakfast and her tooth fell out. It pooped into her cereal by accident and she ate it. She is sad to say that she will never see her tooth again.Review: I love the poem I Ate a Tooth this Morning because as a kid I was always nervous that I might also loose a tooth inside of something I was eating. I think this poem is very relatable for children. I also think that the little illustration at the bottom matches very well, as you can see the nervousness in the girls face.I might pair this poem with any other poems in this collection of poems, as all of these poems have humor and rhythm.Juicy Quote: ""I'm sorry that is happened, and I'm sorrier to say that I will never see again that tooth I ate today."" This quote is a good quote as you can hear the rhythm and pacing with this line of the poem, so it can be used to teach those thing about poetry to young students.Summary: I'm Stuck Inside a Seashell is about someone who got stuck inside of a seashell. The person went into the seashell and just kept going further in until they got lost. The person is nervous that he or she will never get out and there is no where left to go.Review: I love the poem I'm Stuck Inside a Seashell mostly because it is a concrete poem. The poem is shaped like the spiral of a seashell. I love this poem also because I love the beach and I have often wondered what it must be like for the animals that live inside seashells.I would pair this poem with other concrete poems to help teach students about creating that type of poem. In a Twist is another example of a concrete poem.Juicy Quote: ""I am winding winding winding through this narrow spiral shape, and I'm sorry that I entered, for it seems there's no escape."" This is a good quote from the poem because it matches the concrete picture of the poem. The students can visualize what it must be like for the person stuck inside the shell.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1299318.It_s_Raining_Pigs_and_Noodles,It's Raining Pigs and Noodles.txt
"Rutherford B., Who Was He?: Poems About Our Presidents","There is a brief moment of doubt when you first cast eyes upon the title of this book. It’s partly the design of the cover, I suppose. Your eye immediately alights on the words “Rutherford B., Who Was He?” and you find yourself thinking, “Is this some kind of lushly illustrated picture book biography of Rutherford B. Hays? Thankfully, no. An overwhelming sense of relief consumes you as your eyes alight on the subtitle, “Poems About Our Presidents”. Whew! Not to say a Hays picture book bio couldn’t exist, but to read it, even if it was brilliance on a page, would feel like the dullest kind of homework. Singer’s latest title, however, is anything but boring. A visually explosive mixture of fact and verse, this may not be the first presidential poetry collection for kids out there, but by gum it’s the best.Our presidents. Who the heck were they? What was their deal? Were they villains or heroes? Memorable or forgettable? Did they serve out their term or die in a variety of grisly fashions? Stretching her poetic chops to the max, Marilyn Singer summarizes each and every fella. Sometimes they have long poems, and sometimes nothing more than a few sentences. Accompanied by artist John Hendrix’s eclectic art, the two weave these disparate men together, tying up their faults and finer distinctions. Backmatter includes a description of the job of the president, Presidential Biographies, and a list of Sources that Singer used to make this book.Comparisons, sadly, are inevitably going to be made between this volume andThe President’s Stuck in the Bathtub: Poems About the Presidentsby Susan Katz, illustrated by Robert Neubecker. Both books go president-by-president bringing up facts about each feller. However, while Katz takes a lighthearted trivia take, Singer is talking about the real issues and problems these guys faced. Take the titular Rutherford B. Hayes. In Katz’s book we’ve an amusing diversion about how he installed the telephones in The White House. In Singer’s we’ve a clever poem explaining why he was called “His Fraudulency”. And while Katz wouldn’t touch Reagan’s controversial aspects with a ten-foot pole (his story is about accidentally treading on a lady’s train at a fancy gala), Singer dives right into it showing both the Democrat and Conservative contemporary thoughts on the man. More to the point there were things I “learned” in Katz’s book that I completely forgot until I read Singer’s. Cleveland served as president twice with Benjamin Harrison in between terms? Who knew? Best of all, Singer doesn’t do one poem per president in a traditional fashion. She mixed it up a bit. She puts guys like Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren in conversation with one another. Or she’ll cram all the dullards into section together, their accomplishments and failures popping up willy-nilly. It's freeing, really.Singer also does something that most books about the presidents eschew: She shows both their strengths and their weaknesses. Even George Washington! Aside from being a slaveholder, few children’s books dare to mention that critics at the time criticized him for failing to establish a plan for the abolition of slavery. This, alongside many other facts, is located not in the poem itself but in the very brief Presidential Biography located at the back of the book. Singer's balanced attitude even extends even to Richard Nixon. The only reverso poem in the book (a technique Singer perfected in books likeMirror Mirror: A Book of Reversible VerseandFollow Follow A Book of Reverso Poems), Nixon’s poem actually goes so far as to mention how the man opened up the gateway to China and helped to protect the environment in his day.We all have our preferred presidents and the ones we just can’t stand. With that in mind, it is inevitable that folks are going to read through this book and disagree with Singer’s take on one prez or another. I, for example, think she was way too nice to official psychopath President Andrew Jackson (his musical isn’t calledBloody Bloody Andrew Jacksonfor nothing, y’know). That said, you can’t please everybody. I’m more than willing to stomach the handling of Jackson (which, to be fair, does touch on some of his problems) so long as Reagan is seen as the divisive figure he remains to this day. Likewise, George W. Bush and Obama. In both cases she manages to work in both the criticisms aimed at them and their significance one way or another.And then there’s the poetry itself. And some of those poems do, in fact, require a thorough reading of the little biographies at the end of the book. Admittedly, the kid that does go so far as to understand every word written there will be few and far between. But the poems are strong. I like that there are different kinds. From your standard ABABAB style to five line poems where the last word is the same rhyme on each line to the aforementioned reverso, to more. My favorite of all the poems, personally, is the discussion between Zachary Taylor, Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, and James Buchanan. Here’s a sample:Taylor: I swore to preserve the Union.I roared: Do Not secede!Fillmore: I felt the states should have their rights.Pierce: I didn’t want this land to bleed.And so I let the states decide –Buchanan: Were they slave or were they free?Taylor: I’d have hanged those rebelsfrom the nearest tree.I’ve managed to go this long without bringing up the work of John Hendrix, which is a feat in and of itself, since much of the book’s success lands squarely on his broad and manly shoulders. Hendrix is a design nut’s dreamboy. He simply has to shake up every possible picture with the turn of a page. Helped not a little by Singer’s willingness to combine her presidents and their poems, one minute he’s drawn a conversation between the four presidents that preceded Lincoln (their speech balloons making them look not a little like the political cartooning style of the day) and the next he’s dipped Kennedy and Johnson in the blue light of a television screen with JFK speaking from the set and LBJ basking in its glow.It’s difficult to say whether or not Hendrix is typecast into illustrating books about historical figures (preferably those of the mid-19th century) or if he just naturally selects those jobs. There’s no denying that when it comes to caricatures, he’s magnificent. Yet he also favors a form of illustration that brings to my mind nothing so much as the speech balloons of P.T. Bridgeport from the old Walt KellyPogocartoons. That poster-like style has served him well over the years, but what I like so much about his work on this book is how he keeps the eye dancing over the pages. Observe how the dance between Grover Cleveland and Benjamin Harrison takes place against a pure white background. Then you turn the page and BLAMMO!! Teddy Roosevelt is riding hell-for-leather over the head of William McKinley in a burst of orange and red. That’s my kind of poetry.I am as certain as the sun shines in the sky that this is not the last book of presidential poetry we have yet to see. In perhaps five years (maybe more, maybe less) a new book will come out with a new spin. Nothing wrong with that. No book should be the be all or the end all on a particular subject. However, I do hope that folks realize with this particular title that aside from being chock full of great verse and art, the factual content makes this puppy invaluable. Smarter than a lot of the pure nonfiction titles out there, Singer and Hendrix have put together one whopper of a good collection. Here’s hoping more folks find it and take to it in the near future.For ages 7 and up.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17428662-rutherford-b-who-was-he,"Rutherford B., Who Was He Poems About Our Presidents.txt"
Hop On Pop,"I never encountered Dr. Seuss during my childhood in Germany (and I also do have to wonder whether Dr. Seuss' delightfully fun and often song like poetry would work all that well in translation, and actually in any type of translation). But I do indeed vividly and with very fond nostalgia recall repeatedly and joyfully using his, using Dr. Seuss' 1963 board bookHop on Pop(which I had found in the school library) in 1976, in grade four, to practice English language prepositions and basic present and past tense verb forms (after having immigrated to Canada from Germany with my family) and indeed findingHop on Popa lot more fun, a lot more engaging and above all also a lot more prepositions and basic English grammar retaining than the bone dry and tedious work sheets that my homeroom teacher kept shoving at me (ha, ha, and notice the propositional phraseat me) and how Mrs. Hopkins was both annoyed with and aghast at me preferring Dr. Seuss andHop on Popto her boring grammar worksheets, as according to both my teacher (and unfortunately also according to my parents), a ten year old should not be reading ANY board books, period (neither for pleasure nor for learning purposes). But well, I say absolute and total utter BS to and for that kind of an attitude, to and for board books supposedly only ever being suitable and useable for younger readers (toddlers), and indeed, when I was teaching ESL classes for adults at the college/university level (about a decade ago),Hop on Popin particular was really and massively popular with my ALL of my students, we had loads and loads of fun with the book and that the chanting of the entire class recitingHop on Poptogether really did help my students to retain the prepositions Dr. Seuss textually features (up, on, in, off, after) and that following a preposition, one needs to use an object and not a subject pronoun (him, her, me instead of he, she, I). And whileHop on Popmight not present an actual plot with a beginning, a middle and an end, Dr. Seuss poetically celebrating withHop on Popword sounds, basic prepositions and verb forms and tenses, this is fun, a delightful, a totally wonderful and creative, marvellous language learning tool, and most definitely shiningly and glowingly five stars.And just to say to and for the IGNORAMUSES who have over the years repeatedly tried to getHop on Popcensored and banned, removed from school and public library shelves because it supposedly encourages violence against fathers I really must ask them they are functionally or deliberately illiterate. For honestly, Dr. Seuss makes it textually very clear that hopping on Pop is NOT acceptable behaviour (and even in grade four, with my very limited English language skills, I immediately knew thatHop on Popdoes not promote and encourage children being violent towards their fathers but very clearly points out that jumping, that hopping on one's father is not condoned, is unacceptable behaviour). I mean, it is frankly and sadly totally ridiculous and laughable that in 2014, some obviously unhinged and braindead Torontonians not only wantedHop on Popremoved from the Toronto Public Library but also were demanding that the TPL write an apology to ALL Toronto fathers (and while the challenge was unsuccessful, it should also and obviously never have even been considered and taken seriously in the first place, as the book banners right from square one so to speak admitted that they had NOT readHop on Popand wanted the book banned and censored just because of the book title).",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206962.Hop_On_Pop,Hop On Pop.txt
Every Time I Climb a Tree,"""Every Time I Climb a Tree"" is a collection of poems by author and illustration David T.W. McCord. In ""Every Time I Climb a Tree"", readers get an inside view of a child's life, through a childlike perspective. What happens when you climb a tree? What happens when you lick a fence? What happens when you see a worm on the floor? With rhythm and prose, each page turns into the next, revealing a new poem, and in turn, a new situation to laugh about, cry about, or relate to. ""Every Time I Climb a Tree"" is a must-have for all ages -- the simplistic vocabulary makes for a solid read for younger readers, while more advanced readers can enjoy and appreciate the deeper themes within each humorous poem.McCord's illustrations within ""Every Time I Climb a Tree"" are beautiful. Each page contains its own poem, and in turn, it's own illustrations. Surrounded by negative space, the relatively simplistic-seeming illustrations create a bare-bone effect, which perfectly parallels the block, to-the-point text. The illustrations usually contain one character with one or two objects, and seem to be created through using watercolor and charcoal pencil. Although the simplicity of the illustrations may seem uninteresting at first, the simplicity of the illustrations help highlight clues and insight to the corresponding poems. For example, in the poem ""The Pickety Fence"", the reader may be a bit confused with the short poem, which states ""Give it a lick, its the pickety fence, give it a lick, its the clickety fence"". This prose may be confusing for some, but the illustration of a young girl running along a fence with a stick, tapping against each beam, gives insight as to what the ""clickety fence"" is referring to. In this way, the illustrations serve two purposes: to compliment the illustrations, and also to provide relevant clues to help readers infer a deeper meaning from the prose. The colors are bright, such as the neon-yellow fence, and the characters are relatively realistic, adding up to a set of illustrations that are short, sweet, and to the point.Though the prose may seem very basic, it is in fact laced with deeper themes and meanings that can be relevant for children of all ages. In the poem ""Every Time I Climb a Tree"", the young child explains the difficulties he experiences when he climbs a tree - he gets bitten by ants, attacked by bees, and always, always, always scrapes his leg or skins his knee. Yet, despite having adults yell at him and question where he's been, he loves climbing trees, and expresses feeling ""free"". This poem explores the innocence of childhood, the desires of a child, and the need of all people, regardless of age, for an escape at times. Each poem relates childhood with adulthood and universal feelings, helping tie the poems to a community and world relevance for every child.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/645882.Every_Time_I_Climb_a_Tree,Every Time I Climb a Tree.txt
My People (Coretta Scott King Award - Illustrator Winner Title,"Audience: This book is good for any type of reader, both genders, and for students in young elementary. In addition to being fitted for early elementary grades it would be a great book for families.Appeal: The first appeal of the book is how few of words it has, in addition to very view words it has elaborate pictures. The pictures being so detailed allow for each reader to interpret the images and meaning.Application: I would use this book when discussing the similarities between cultures because it has such strong meaning of the beauty of people.Awards: This book won the Coretta Scott King Illustrator Award winner in 2010.Review:K Up-Smith's knack for pairing poetry and photography is well documented in books such as Hoop Queens (Candlewick, 2003) and Rudyard Kipling's If (S & S, 2006). Here, his artful images engage in a lyrical and lively dance with Langston Hughes's brief ode to black beauty. Dramatic sepia portraits of African Americans-ranging from a cherubic, chubby-cheeked toddler to a graying elder whose face is etched with lines-are bathed in shadows, which melt into black backgrounds. The 33 words are printed in an elegant font in varying sizes as emphasis dictates. In order to maximize the effect of the page turn and allow time for meaning to be absorbed, the short phrases and their respective visual narratives often spill over more than a spread. The conclusion offers a montage of faces created with varying exposures, a decision that provides a light-filled aura and the irregularities that suggest historical prints. A note from Smith describes his approach to the 1923 poem. This celebration of the particular and universal will draw a wide audience: storytime participants; students of poetry, photography, and cultural studies; seniors; families.

The Cat in the Hat,"This ""kids' book"" is, in my opinion, a nightmare-quality horror story.Why, you ask? What's scary about a funny-looking cat? *shudder* Well, what's so scary about these cute things?(Well, there actually is nothing scary about that last one. That still doesn't make it any less of a nightmare.)Sometimes I have nightmares where everything goes wrong, but I am helpless to do anything about it. What's worse, the voice of reason is gone. Well, that pretty much sums up the plot of this book.As a horror story, it gets solid 3 stars.Quick, somebody call Stephen King!Two kids are left alone on a dreary rainy day - which by the way is aperfect setting for a horror story.(Sidenote:I am not that outraged with the mother leaving the kids unsupervised. In Eastern Europe parents do it all the time. And we survived). Suddenly a stranger barges in and insists that the kids join him in his games (*cue ominous music here*). And he refuses to leave.Yeah, if this creature barged into my house, I'd be curled up in a ball in a corner, wailing and wetting myself.The sentient fish, who appears to supervise the kids and is the sole voice of sanity here, sensibly protests (He should not be here. He should not be about. He should not be here When your mother is out!) - and immediately gets physically threatened and abused. Terrified, it demands the abuse to stop -""This is no fun at all! Put me down! [...] I do NOT wish to fall!""- and narrowly avoids death. Hilarious, right?Not to mention that, for a fish, seeing a cat is like you answering the doorbell just to greet a Grim Reaper.Next, the terrifying delinquent Cat unleashesThings(perfect name for horror creatures) who wreck havoc on the house. Then the Cat cleans up and vanishes.Basically there iszero evidenceleft of this horrific intrusion even if the kids tried to tell.But likely the poor little victims will keep quiet. And who knows what will happen the next time the Cat shows up, knowing there are no consequences...*shudder* / *ominous music* / *Nataliya keeps her light on at night to avoid nightmares*""Should we tell her The things that went on there that day?""YES. YOU SHOULD, KIDS. ALWAYS. PLEASE DO TELL YOUR PARENTS!----------------------Ok, enough about the story.1 star rating for lazy writing and lazy rhyming.Apparently, the author spent months coming up with a long poem that is almost fully monosyllabic. Here is the issue. If children are old enough to read this long poem by themselves, they should be able to read more than a syllable at a time. I know I did. Let's not be condescending to kids - they are capable of a lot if we give them the benefit of the doubt.Now, rhyming. I guess you run out of words quickly if you are limited to single syllables but still need to maintain the poetry rhythm. Still, it's not a justification for pathetic excuse of lines that go ""Cold, cold wet day"", ""Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit!"", ""We sat there we two"", ""The sun is not sunny"", ""Fun that is funny"", ""So so so..."" That is just lazy. Just because the story is for kids does not mean it's okay for the writing to be subpar.The story has enough exclamation points to drive you mad.""And then something went BUMP! How that bump made us jump! We looked! Then we saw him step in on the mat! We looked! And we saw him! The Cat in the Hat!""To quote (and take slightly out of context) the great Terry Pratchett,""Multiple exclamation marks are a sure sign of a diseased mind.""---------------------------------Yeah. Not a fan of this one. Maybe it's because I am a few decades past the target audience. Maybe it's because the book scares the bejeezus out of me.2 stars total for the horror potential(which is higher than my initial 1-star rating, so yay?).

Mirror Mirror: A Book of Reverso Poems,"I like to think that the world of children's literature has gained a bit more respect in the last decade or so. Folks notice it and reference it more often. And as sales continue to be good and scholars take note of it more often, its sub-genres proliferate and gain acceptance. Graphic novelists of children's fare increase. Non-fiction writers for kids demand more attention. And then there are the poets. Poets like Marilyn Singer who has been doing good steady work for years and years. I'm looking at my watch and I see that it's just about time that Ms. Singer get her due. How clever of her to make it easy on me by producing a poetry picture book that is not only fun, not only clever, and not only beautiful to look at, but also has a good FIVE stars from five professional review journals.Mirror Mirroris everything a person wants in a book for kids. It's enjoyable for children, who will pore over the wordplay for long stretches of time, and it's clever enough for the gatekeepers (librarians, teachers, parents, etc.) who want a poetry book for kids that doesn't take them to Snoresville, USA.Mirror Mirror, in short, delivers.Better flip to the back of the book (how appropriate!) if you want an explanation of what's going on here. Says the last page, ""We read most poems down a page. But what if we read them up?"" Calling such poems ""reversos"", Singer's concept is simple. Each poem is repeated. The one on the left is read down. Then Singer takes the same words, puts in some slightly different punctuation, and when each line is read backwards it tells an entirely new story. The stories in this book are fairy tales and Singer not only tells the tales frontwards and backwards but gives them new stories too. The ugly duckling, for example, has some doubts of his own potential beauty. In his upbeat poem he says confidently, ""Plain to see - / look at me. / A beauty I'll be."" Then doubts set in and he sighs, ""A beauty I'll be? / Look at me - / plain to see."" One of the smartest books out there for kids, young readers will be entranced by Singer's wordplay and Masse's lovely (if not equally clever) illustrations.When I first heard of a ""reverso"" I thought it meant a poem where every single word is backwards when it repeats. Fortunately, Singer has no wish to drive herself bonkers. It's not every word that's backwards, but lines. This makes for great wordplay, and some creative solutions. My favorite is the poem that I think also comes across as the cleverest. ""In the Hood"" is a Little Red Riding Hood take. It's short, so I can write it in full here. On the Little Red side of the equation it reads, ""In my hood / skipping through the wood / carrying a basket / picking berries to eat - / juicy and sweet / what a treat! / But a girl / mustn't dawdle. / After all, Grandma's waiting."" The wolf replies, ""After all, Grandma's waiting, / mustn't dawdle . . . / But a girl! / What a treat - / juicy and sweet, / picking berries to eat, / carrying a basket, / skipping through the wood / in my `hood.""Alas, not every poem is equally strong. I found I was a little baffled by the Rapunzel verses, since I couldn't figure out who was telling each of the two poems. Generally speaking, though, these glitches are the exception rather than the rule. And if you don't care for one poem, you're bound to think another is fantastic.Most folks will probably look at the pictures here and assume that illustrator Josee Masse utilizes a kind of paint on wood technique similar to the work ofStefano Vitale. Not the case, I assure you. According to her editor, ""she painted the pieces of art with acrylic paint on illustration board. She uses an undercoat of acrylic which is what gives the texture . . . . Then she builds up colors on top of that"". These puppies clearly took serious work to make. What I like about the pictures too is how well she has split the pictures that accompany the poems into two mirror-like images. Their details reflect how well Masse has understood the text too. For example, in the poem ""Do You Know My Name?"" the girl from the Rumpelstiltskin story laments that even though she's the beloved heroine, no one ever knows her name. On the opposite page we see the little man dancing beside a fire that burns his name into smoke, while on the other side that smoke has turned into golden thread that spells out nothing at all. Extra points to Masse for taking the time to draw a correct bobbin on a spinning wheel too. Most artists of that story don't take the time (Paul Zelinskybeing an exception).I can't help but think that with the success of this book Singer and Masse will simply have to give in to the demands of their fans and do a sequel of sorts. Why, they could take nursery rhymes in the second! Then classic children's books in the third. Then famous women from history, tall tales, presidents, the list goes on and on. For now, though, we can enjoy this single reverso collection, possibly the first of its kind for kids. Beautiful both as object and as a way of getting kids interested in poetic forms, this is a must purchase for any library or home collection. One of a kind.Ages 4-8",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7493149-mirror-mirror,Mirror Mirror A Book of Reverso Poems.txt
"Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?","I still (and yes, even years later) cannot even remotely fathom that Bill Martin Junior's classic and universally beloved by young childrenBrown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?was actually and in fact categorically banned in 2010 by the State Board of Education in Texas because its (and no, I am not really feeling contrite at all or in any manner guilty about being insulting and denigrating here) obviously woefully lacking in even basic intelligence members (and in particular totally moronic board member Pat Harding, who also made things much much worse and herself look absolutely and utterly ridiculous by repeatedly and vocally trying to justify her sorry self) somehow and in error believed that Bill Martin Junior was the author, was the same Bill Martin of the DePaul University in Chicago, who in 2008 penned an academic textbook calledEthical Marxism: The Categorical Imperative of Liberation(a book I have actually read, and no, it did not turn me into a raging Communist either, Ms. Harding).I mean, banning children's books is bad enough anyhow as well as it being totally undemocratic and dictatorial (read Stalinist, Fascist), but really for those extremist right-wing Texas ignorants who were obviously infesting the State Board of Education like dangerous parasites to ban and to forbidBrown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?from being used and displayed in Texas schools because they were obviously not able to figure out that the author ofBrown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?and the author ofEthical Marxism: The Categorical Imperative of Liberationwere different Bill Martins (and especially since Bill Martin Junior had died in 2004 and the other Bill Martin did not even pen his ethical Marxism book until 2008), this just so totally and painfully shows that the Texas Board of Education's members who insisted onBrown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?being removed from schools are either not able or not willing to adequately research authors or the books they write. And really, how is the Texas Board of Education's 2010 banning ofBrown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?any different from when in the South Africa of apartheid, Anna Sewell's classic horse autobiographyBlack Beautywas banned by government bureaucrats because they thought the novel was about people with darker skins being beautiful (and of course, this could not be accepted in South Africa, and without the bureaucrats even bothering to readBlack Beauty, it was banned and restricted by idiots with clout and power).But then again, perhaps Pat Harding actually did readBrown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?and thought (after noticing the author's name and freaking out in error and terror) that there indeed might be some kind of hidden and insidious left wing propaganda present and ready to hurt young children inBrown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?, to turn them into Communist agitators, that perhaps Eric Carle's illustration of that big red bird signifies Bill Martin Junior's support of Russian Communism, of Leninism and that the yellow duck's colour could be considered as being a positive nod towards China, towards Maoism? I mean, who knows, and while I am of course being majorly tongue in cheek and facetious here, it is indeed pretty darn surprising and woefully painful how many strange reasons for banning books especially book banners in the USA and in staunchly Social Conservative areas do seem to regularly come up with and vehemently support (and democracy, my foot, or rather my ass, since Social Conservatism is far far too often politically Fascist in scope at best and also even quite majorly politically and philosophically akin to Stalinism and Leninism at its extreme, at Social Conservatism's most reactionary and most radical, and that Social Conservatives are actually and generally speaking politically speaking hard core collectivist and radically LEFT WING Stalinists, and yes, I am talking about putrid individuals such as Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, Greg Abbott, Pierre Polièvre et al and their moronic and ignorant LEFFTIE supporters).",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/759611.Brown_Bear_Brown_Bear_What_Do_You_See_,"Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See.txt"
Sheep in a Jeep,"This book first caught my eye because of the red Jeep on the cover, owning a similar jeep I dove head first into this mind boggling 32 page masterpiece thinking it would help with the sheep like noises coming from my jeep. I learned all too quick that this book was well beyond my age when I failed to realize that sheep cannot drive a jeep! The artistic factor in this book is well below sub-par, I think I could have drawn better in an ambien induced coma. I am not sure who the author was trying to insinuate the sheep to be, but they are some sketchy animals! Once they crash their jeep into a heap they try to sell this lemon without providing a Carfax report. This book teaches people to be sly and dishonest. I would recommend this book for anyone who is looking for a career as a crooked car salesmen or a life in prison.

The Night Before Christmas,"A visit from Saint Nicholas might have seemed more like a Yuletide home invasion back in 1823 – or so one might conclude after a close reading of Clement Clarke Moore’s original poem. That poem, which may be better-known to many readers simply as “The Night Before Christmas,” has done a great deal to influence how Americans in the two centuries since its publication think about the holiday – even if the Saint Nicholas of the poem differs in many respects from the popular Santa Claus figure of the present day.A word, first, about an authorship controversy that still swirls, like cold winter winds, around this beloved poem. While Moore, a classics professor and Episcopalian divine at New York’s General Theological Seminary, took credit in 1837 for the anonymously published 1823 poem, a number of critics and historians have joined with the family of Henry Livingston Jr., in claiming that Livingston, a New Yorker who served as a major in the Continental Army during the American Revolution, actually wrote the poem and regularly recited it to his children.It would seem, therefore, that – just as Shakespeare scholars are divided into “Stratfordians” (who believe that Shakespeare wrote his own plays) and “Oxfordians” (who insist that Edward DeVere, 17th Earl of Oxford, actually wrote the plays and had them published under Shakespeare’s name) – so those who examine the life of this poem can be divided into “Mooreans” and “Livingstonians.” But without delving too far into the holly-thorned thickets of literary controversy – where, 100 years from now, Dr. Scrooge of Oxford and Dr. Grinch of Stanford and Dr. Krampus of Heidelberg will no doubt be fighting out this controversy in the scholarly journals of the year 2124 – let us turn to this delightful poem, here in its bicentennial year, and enjoy it for its own sake, in the true spirit of Christmas.The poem begins on a note that will be quite familiar to everyone:Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the houseNot a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there…Here, we see that by 1823 – in the midst of American history’s “Era of Good Feeling,” in the year when President James Monroe had published the “Monroe Doctrine” stating that the nations of the Americas were henceforth closed to European colonization – the tradition of hanging stockings by the chimney, for Saint Nicholas to fill them with gifts, was already well-entrenched.The scene is one of a peaceful, contented, safe early-19th-century American home –The children were nestled all snug in their beds,While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;And mamma in her ‘kerchief, and I in my cap,Had just settled down for a long winter’s nap…And that scene too has become thoroughly familiar to us, even if relatively few people, young or old, eat sugarplums nowadays.At that point, the poem takes on a somewhat darker tone – “When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,/I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.” Even if the makers of the filmThe Santa Clause(1994) had some fun with these lines from the poem, showing the appearance at the main characters’ house of a magical ladder manufactured by “The Rose Suchak Ladder Company,” it seems evident that the speaker of the poem, a homeowner, is worried about the prospects of a burglary gang attacking his peaceful home.Once the worried homeowner has flown like a flash to his bedroom window, opened the shutters, and raised the sash, he engages in an oft-overlooked bit of elaborate 19th-century description – “The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow/Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below”. And against that brightly lit winter night-time landscape, the reader gets a first sight of “a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer.”The manner in which the speaker insists upon the miniature size of the sleigh and reindeer may seem a curiosity to us nowadays, as the sleigh and the eight reindeer are always depicted in modern Christmas tales as being full-size. But given the “elf” references that appear throughout the poem, the poet may have felt obligated to make these future archetypes of the Christmas holiday “elfin” in nature by reducing their size.It is at this point that we are introduced to one of the most famous characters in all of folklore – as the reindeer are being guided by “a little old driver, so lively and quick,/I knew in a moment it must be Saint Nick.” The reader must wait a bit for more of a proper introduction to the saint, as the poet, evidently quite taken with the image of the reindeer as “coursers”, shows Saint Nick calling to his reindeer by name, issuing a quite-specific command:“Now, Dasher! Now, Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen!On, Comet! On, Cupid! On, Donner and Blitzen!To the top of the porch! To the top of the wall!Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!”There it is: the reindeer have names – names that will live on as long as December 25th is celebrated as a holiday.Once this command has been given, the poet offers one more descriptive flourish, and then the eight reindeer display their most famous magical ability:As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky,So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,With the sleigh full of toys, and Saint Nicholas, too.Please note that the reindeer do indeed fly, but only in response to Saint Nicholas’ command, and only for the purpose of getting the sleigh up and onto the roof; evidently, up until that point, the sleigh and its reindeer simply went dashing through the snow just the way less magically-adept people’s horse-drawn sleighs do.The speaker of the poem hears the hoof-prints of reindeer “prancing and pawing” on his roof; and then, just as he’s closing his window, “Down the chimney Saint Nicholas came with a bound!” The poem takes on particular interest for the modern viewer here, as the speaker gets his first clear look at a Saint Nicholas who appears quite different from the Santa Claus of today:He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.This “St. Nick,” I would dare say, looks quite different from Saint Nicholas of Myra (270-343 A.D.), whose surprise gifts of gold coins, dropped through the windows of three homes of poor families in Asia Minor, saved the marriageable daughters of those families from being sold to human traffickers. Nor does this soot-covered, fur-clad figure seem much like the red-and-white-clad Santa Claus of today, who took shape in the early 20th century in depictions like Haddon Sundblom’s illustrations for Coca-Cola advertisements.Even the use of the word “peddler” is multi-layered and potentially troubling. Peddlers were the door-to-door salesmen of their day; they brought the convenience of immediate access to consumer goods in a still largely-rural America, but represented a potentially troubling irruption of “outside” values (as demonstrated by the profusion of “traveling salesman” jokes in American folklore). And, as the Wikipedia entry on peddlers points out, peddlers in 19th-century America were often of Greek, Italian, or Jewish background, belonging to groups that faced ethnic intolerance and religion-based discrimination from the Anglo-American, Protestant majority of the United States' population.One wonders: if the devout Moore did indeed write this poem, might he be offering a subversive, transgressive reminder to his readers that the Saviour they all worshipped was a Jewish man who dressed humbly (perhaps not unlike a “peddler”), had no fixed address, and was rejected by many of the “respectable” people of His time? Or that the original Saint Nicholas was Greek, and would have been Orthodox rather than Protestant, and was a man who spent his life preaching human equality rather than seeking to elevate some human beings “above” others? But perhaps I’m reading too much into the poet’s deployment of one simple word. Or perhaps not.We can all agree that the poet’s depiction of Saint Nicholas is vivid, with immediate sensory appeal and compelling characterization:His eyes — how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath;He had a broad face and a little round belly,That shook, when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly.Here, we see elements of the modern Santa Claus archetype taking shape. He is jolly, benevolent, slightly mischievous – as suits someone who commits countless acts of breaking-and-entering each year, but breaks into homes to give gifts rather than taking things away. All one needs to do is take away the details about Saint Nicholas smoking a pipe – something that wouldnotpass muster with modern sensibilities.Overall, St. Nick makes a positive impression on the poem’s speaker – “He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf/And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.” And the speaker’s fears of a home invasion by malign burglar-elves finally seem to be dissipated when the speaker reflects that “A wink of [St. Nick’s] eye and a twist of his head/Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.” Abouttimeyou realized that, sir!Free at last of the homeowner’s suspicions, St. Nick “spoke not a word, but went straight to his work/And filled all the stockings”, as has been a St. Nick tradition ever since. Once he is done with his appointed task, St. Nick “turned with a jerk,/And laying his finger aside of his nose,/And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose” – demonstrating the magical gravity-defying abilities that would become a part of Santa Claus folklore forevermore.The poem’s speaker records that St. Nick “sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,/And away they all flew like the down of a thistle”. It is not clear here whether the word “flew” means that they flew through the sky, in the conventional Santa-and-reindeer scenario of today, or whether they all just drove off in the sleigh quite quickly. Nonetheless, the speaker heard St. Nick “exclaim, as he drove out of sight,/Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!”There have been many book adaptations of “The Night Before Christmas” – Acadian (“Cajun”), African American, Arizonan, Irish, “Kiwi” (New Zealand), LaNochebuena (Mexican), Ozark, Pennsylvania-Dutch, and Texan “Nights Before Christmas,” as well as versions for dinosaurs, pirates, and the Rugrats, and even occupation-specific variants directed toward librarians, pirates, preachers, principals, soldiers, and teachers. And there have been eight films with the title, from 1942 to 1994. Here one sees proof of the poem’s ongoing power and influence, along with evidence in favour of that old saying regarding the sincerest form of flattery.Yet nothing – not authorship controversies, not a host of not-always inspired readings and adaptations, not the changes in holiday fashion over two centuries and counting – takes away from the power and the influence of this little poem. Whether you call it “A Visit from Saint Nicholas” or “The Night Before Christmas,” it is one of the most influential poems ever written, and is a joy to experience, on Christmas Day or at any other time.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/196970.The_Night_Before_Christmas,The Night Before Christmas.txt
My Parents Think I'm Sleeping,"Age Group: 3rd grade - 5th gradeSummary: My parents think I'm sleeping is a short simple story about a boy tricking his parents that he is all tucked in bed under his covers, when really he is wide awake. He turns on his flashlight and is reading poems and stories. He is playing with pieces of a model rocket and not fast asleep at all. He waited for his parents to leave then dove beneath the covers with his light to play. He believes his parents think that he is sleeping and that he has them truly fooled. (This is one story from a series of short stories from the ""I Can Read!"" series)Theme: The theme of this short story is the innocence that children hold. This story shows how the little boy thinks he is being so sneak in playing and using he flashlight in bed, but clearly his parents know that he is not actually asleep. He is so happy playing around in his bed that his parents continue to let him do that until he eventually falls asleep on his own.Personal Response: I really enjoyed reading this particular short story out of the ""I Can Read"" series. I really related to what the little boy was doing because I would do the same exact thing as a child and my mom just recently told me she knew I was still awake every time, but let me do it because I was reading and then would just fall asleep when I got tired anyways. I love how this book depicts how sneaky the little boy thinks he is being, because in reality his parents know what he is up to. He is just so happy to be under his covers awake, when he is supposed to be asleep.Recommendation: I would recommend using this particular short story, as well as the series as a whole in the classroom. I love these books because they aren't at too hard of a reading level so kids are able to enjoy them on their own or with an adult reading them. They are great to have stored in the classroom as they are short, and interesting for children just beginning to read on their own. I think it would be beneficial to read this short story then begin a discussion with the kids about if they have ever done something they thought was sneaky and how they grew from that. It could also be fun to read this before bed with your child and then let them read a book with a flashlight under their covers until they are responsible enough to decide when they are tired.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203173.My_Parents_Think_I_m_Sleeping,My Parents Think I'm Sleeping.txt
The New Kid on the Block,"Outside of Shel Silverstein and Dr. Seuss, one would be hard-pressed to come up with an American composer of juvenile poetry who was more a fixture over the course of his or her long career than Jack Prelutsky. His books were brought to life by some of the finest illustrators of his day, a veritable Hall of Fame of the art form including Victoria Chess, Brandon Dorman, James Stevenson (illustrator ofThe New Kid on the Block), Dan Yaccarino, Peter Sís, Paul O. Zelinsky, Chris Raschka, Garth Williams, and Arnold Lobel, collaborators he conspired with diligently to set the perfect tone for his work in word and image. Jack Prelutsky guest-starred on the classic PBS animated television seriesArthurin the episodeI'm a Poet, which first aired May 19, 1997, reciting a couple of his famous poems fromThe New Kid on the Blockin his role as judge at a kids' poetry contest. But I think what lifted Jack Prelutsky to rarified air among his poet contemporaries is the appealing mix of comedy and deeper meaning in his work. One never knows which way his poems are going to turn until the last line, so there's a sense of unexpectedness to his verses. Jack Prelutsky writes humor well, as effectively as Shel Silverstein at his best, but positioned amidst the laughs are islands of personal affirmation, literary substance that reinforces the rest of the book and allows it to stand taller. I've also noticed that few—if any—children's poets utilize vocabulary like Jack Prelutsky. He ransacks the lexicon for witty, applicable rhymes to keep his poems pithy and rhythmic, but the super-advanced terms usually define themselves easily by the context they're used in, a plus for his unique methodology of complex word integration. The introduction of high-level vocabulary is as painless as possible, and that means learning takes place while the laughs arrive in droves. No matter your age or education,The New Kid on the Blockwill enhance your grasp of the American language, and that's good for everyone.""I spied my shadow slinkingup behind me in the night,I issued it a challenge,and we started in to fight.I wrestled with that shadow,but it wasn't any fun,I tried my very hardest—all the same, my shadow won.""—I Spied My Shadow Slinking, P. 72The New Kid on the Blockcontains too many poems to discuss each individually, but several deserve special mention.Jellyfish Stewis the composition Jack Prelutsky starts reading at the end of hisArthurepisode, to a crowd of excited third-graders who can't get enough of his clever verses.Clara Cleechis about juggling, so what's not to like? If I were going to commit one poem in this anthology to memory, it would probably beClara Cleech.I Am Running in a Circleis the amusing misadventure of a boy caught in a revolving door, but captures the feeling of being stuck in any situation, going around and around in circles, helpless to get untracked.An Unassuming Owlis one of the book's funniest offerings, a mixture of wordplay and goodnatured ribbing of grammatical sticklers. We find deeper substance inAh! A Monster's Lot is Merry, a goopy swamp creature's raucous ode to the joys of antisocial living if it means we're allowed to be gross, unkempt, and play by our own rules without having to impress anyone. The reader is left to decide for him- or herself if it's better to have friends or live entirely as one pleases. I mustn't forget to praiseHomework! Oh, Homework!, a cathartically expressive rant against the evils of mounds of unwanted homework being dumped in the laps of kids every day. Who wants to go home after clocking seven or more hours at school and then put in a few more hours doing the same sort of assignments? I think we all can empathize with the sentiment ofHomework! Oh, Homework!My Dog, He Is an Ugly Dogis a lovely composition concealed beneath the topsoil of silliness. A boy runs down a litany of his dog's many faults, only to conclude the dog is the perfect pet for him. When we acknowledge the flaws in our friends and ourselves, we're free to love without unfair expectation, unconditionally, and that's the rich soil which grows relationships of value.Yubbazubbies(wow, what a title!) is a heartsong to the sweet, scrumptious Yubbazubbies that run around everywhere, flavorful little fruits irresistible to the taste buds. Yubbazubbies are a treat too tantalizing to turn down when they come your way. You can't blame a person for trying a few, right? We're only human. InGussie's Greasy Spoon, the narrator outlines every way the titular restaurant fails its customers with its invariably stomach-turning food options. Everything about the place is disgusting...so why does the narrator return for lunch every day? I suppose our lack of judgment in indulging our own unseemly habits deserves no less ridicule, going back to sup on the same queasy fare day after day, settled into old, destructive habits and lacking momentum to escape the rut.Gussie's Greasy Spoonleaves us with something to consider in that regard.The Cherries' Garden Galashowcases some of the tightest, smartest rhymes inThe New Kid on the Block, a cheerful rundown of the festivities when an assortment of fruits and vegetables in the mood to celebrate convene to dance the night away in toast to the harvest's success. There are more coy puns in this poem than I have room to cite: ""the Ginger seemed well-bred,"" ""the Radishes grew hoarse"", ""the Grapes began to whine,"" ""the Rhubarb got to fighting,"" ""the Sage repeated maxims,"" and on and on with myriad punny delights.The Cherries' Garden Galamight be the most fun you'll have in this book.An Alley Cat with One Life Leftcircles back to more substantive stanzas, as an alley cat lists the unfortunate ways he's squandered his first eight lives. There's no leeway for a misstep now with only one life in reserve, but he isn't bitter about it. ""I'm an alley cat with one life left, and glad that life is mine."" The duration of his final life is by no means guaranteed, but the alley cat will appreciate it, take care of it, and live it up while his heart still beats.An Irritating Creaturepresents the ballad of a sketchy, unpleasant living thing that won't leave the narrator alone. He sends it farther away each time he ejects it from his home, desperate to be rid of the creature's unsavory companionship, but nothing does the trick. ""It appears I can't evict it, though I truly wish I could, it's entirely too tenacious—I suspect it's here for good."" Wow, does that ever describe some of the personal problems that plague us, issues we wish we could bring under control but instead seem to dictate to us. Not every irritating creature can be packed up and stowed on a rocket destined for deep space. InToday Is Very Boring, we have another poem recited by Jack Prelutsky during his appearance onArthur, the ho-hum discourse of a boy who decries the dullness of his life even as once-in-a-lifetime occurrences humorously pop up all around him. If we're dead-set on writing our life off as drab and uninteresting, how are we going to change our mindset when excitement knocks on the door? It would be a pity not to realize how incredible the world around us every day is simply because we're conditioned to ignore its wonders, but we're all guilty of that to some degree. We can take a vital cue fromToday Is Very Boringand apply it to our lives forthwith.""Oh, Teddy Bear, dear Teddy,though you're gone these many years,I recall with deep affectionhow I nibbled on your ears,I can hardly keep from smiling,and my heart beats fast and glows,when I think about the morningthat I twisted off your nose.Teddy Bear, you didn't whimper,Teddy Bear, you didn't pout,when I reached in with my fingersand I tore your tummy out,and you didn't even mumbleor emit the faintest cries,when I pulled your little paws off,when I bit your button eyes.Yes, you sat beside me calmly,and you didn't once protest,when I ripped apart the stuffingthat was packed inside your chest,and you didn't seem to noticewhen I yanked out all your hair—it's been ages since I've seen you,but I miss you, Teddy Bear.""—Oh, Teddy Bear, PP. 110-111Oh, Teddy Bearis, to me, the best poem inThe New Kid on the Block, the main reason I have to round my two-and-a-half star rating up, if not consider giving this book the full three stars. The sentiments ofOh, Teddy Bearare so simple, even comically framed, but they tug at the heartstrings like nothing else in this collection. When I think back toThe New Kid on the Block,Oh, Teddy Bearis the poem I'll remember and get tears in my eyes at the thought of.Ballad of a Boneless Chickenrelates the experiences of a chicken born without a skeleton, a chicken who wishes she could get important things done in life, but lacks the internal calcified system to do anything about it. ""I have feathers fine and fluffy, I have lovely little wings, but I lack the superstructure to support these splendid things."" How many times have we felt like the boneless chicken, filled with grand dreams of conquest and accomplishment but without the self-discipline or courage to make the sacrifices necessary to fulfill those dreams? I can't imagine a more helpless feeling than crawling around for a lifetime as a boneless chicken, unable to pursue any worthy goal to completion because one can't control one's impulses.My Sister Is a Sissyherds the anthology from veiled philosophical musing back to pure fun, with the third Jack Prelutsky poem included in hisArthurepisode. It wasn't animated Jack Prelutsky who read this one, but Arthur the Aardvark, himself, opening the show with this silly soliloquy about a boy whose sister is creeped out by practically everything under the sun. It must have been rewarding for one legacy children's author (Prelutsky) to have his work recited by the most famous character of another (Marc Brown) on television.Jack Prelutsky isn't Shel Silverstein, but he's not too far behind. What I love aboutThe New Kid on the Blockis the feeling that the zany people populating its poems could all live on the same city block, leading their comedically satisfying lives mostly behind closed doors so they aren't aware of the richness of humor in every house they pass by so close to home. That infuses the book with a subtle warmth, and I appreciate it. Artist James Stevenson's résumé can't compete with the manifold triumphs of Arnold Lobel's writing and illustrating career, but Stevenson is up to the task of doing Jack Prelutsky's poetry justice in this book, just as Lobel did in his own lauded collaborations with Mr. Prelutsky. I do adoreThe New Kid on the Block, and recommend it for readers ready to be introduced to the pleasures of Prelutsky poetry. You don't want to miss this one.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/488240.The_New_Kid_on_the_Block,The New Kid on the Block.txt
Goodnight Moon,"“In the great green roomThere was a telephoneAnd a red balloonAnd a picture of – ”Goodnight Moonis a classic and well-loved American children’s picture book from 1947. It was written by Margaret Wise Brown and illustrated by Clement Hurd. Many American adults remember it as their favourite bedtime story, and it continues to lull young children to sleep to this very day.The book describes a bedtime ritual, more than telling an actual story. A young anthropomorphic bunny is in bed saying“good night”to everything she can see around her:“Goodnight roomGoodnight moonGoodnight cow jumping over the moonGoodnight light, and the red balloon ...”There are three books in the series, all by the same author and illustrator, the others being“The Runaway Bunny”and“My World”. These three books have been published together as a collection, with the overall title“Over the Moon”.In this rhyming poem, the bunny works her way through seemingly random but personally significant objects, such as a red balloon, the bunny’s doll’s house, two kittens, a brush and comb and so on. The book has slowly become a bestseller. It has currently sold an estimated 48 million copies, and been translated into over a dozen different languages. It is hard to see the attraction, save that a bedtime ritual is helpful and reassuring, little children love rhymes, and a familiar short book often becomes a favourite. The illustrations are simply drawn, and coloured in flat areas with no shading. There is a spacious feel about the room, however, and the light cast on the bunny seems benevolent; the moon outside friendly, the twinkly stars restful and familiar. To an adult it may seem surreal, but there is an appeal for young children.It seems to be the case with several great writers of children’s classics, that they never leave their childhood behind in the conventional way. They never really become settled domestically, in happy relationships, or as normally functioning members of society. Perhaps the most inspired children’s writers never grow up. Margaret Wise Brown was a restless and unsettled person. She never had children of her own, and her affairs were often chaotic and unstable. She had periods of despair and loneliness, and there are many reports of her provocative or obstructive comments. Her books may seem delightfully whimsical, but under the surface seemingly lies isolation and turmoil. She called one longstanding lesbian lover,“Rabbit”, but even their relationship was by all accounts rocky and tormented. In desperation her lover once took an illustrator aside and said,“Why don’t you marry Margaret and take her off my hands?”Perhaps it is the author’s brittle and alienated personality which enabled her to empathise with how little children would feel reassured. Margaret Wise Brown once said that she considered the purpose of children’s books to be:“to jog him with the unexpected and comfort him with the familiar.”Quite prolific in her work, Margaret Wise Brown originally worked as a teacher, and also studied art. It was while working at the“Bank Street Experimental School”in New York City, that she started writing books for children. The school believed in a new approach to children’s education and literature, one which was rooted in the real world, and the here and now. Margaret Wise Brown embraced both this philosophy, and also was influenced by the poet Gertrude Stein.She once referred to the:“painful shy animal dignity with which a child stretches to conform to a strange, adult social politeness.”Margaret Wise Brown’s first children’s book was published in 1937 and entitled“When the Wind Blew”. She went on to develop her“Here and Now”stories, and later the“Noisy Book”series. Between 1944 and 1946, she wrote three picture books under the pseudonym“Golden MacDonald”. Even in her personal life the author went by various nicknames, perhaps seeking an identity. To some she was“Tim”, as her hair was the colour of timothy hay. To others she was“Brownie”. To those who were familiar with the use of the pseudonym“Golden MacDonald”, she was“Goldie”. Early in the 1950s she wrote several books for the“Little Golden Books”series, including“The Color Kittens”, “Mister Dog”, and“Scuppers The Sailor Dog”.Margaret Wise Brown was a lifelong beagler, very keen on hunting hares and rabbits. A beagle pack of ten or more hounds, following the animals by scent, would usually be followed on foot. The author's enthusiasm and ability to keep pace with the hounds was well known at the time. In one interview for“Life”magazine, the reporter expressed surprise that such affectionate portrayals of so many rabbits in her books could be created by one who had such a zest for hunting and shooting rabbits. The author replied:“Well, I don’t especially like children, either. At least not as a group. I won’t let anybody get away with anything just because he is little.”Even her last moments seem akin to something from a black farce. Margaret Wise Brown was in a hospital in France, with appendicitis. The operation seemed to be routine, and she was clearly in one of her ebullient social moods. Earlier the same year she had met James Stillman “Pebble” Rockefeller Junior at a party, and they became engaged. One morning, she jokily kicked her leg in a can-can style, to prove to one of the medics how well she was recovering. An embolism killed her instantly. Perhaps she would have appreciated this grotesquerie.Margaret Wise Brown left behind over 70 unpublished manuscripts. Her sister tried to sell them without success, so kept them instead, in a cedar trunk for decades. Comprising more than 500 typewritten pages in all, they were rediscovered in 1991, and most have now been published. Many of them have new illustrations, but most, like this edition ofGoodnight Moonare still in print with the original illustrations.The book is compact and sturdy. In this case “board” book describes the pages as well as the cover. It is very substantial and can withstand overly affectionate treatment by the smallest people. However, neither the text nor the illustrations of the book especially appeal to me. I do understand that it has had a classic appeal to several generations. I see that no less than fifteen of my friends have rated it 5 stars, and several more rate it above average. I have to assume then, that in this case I am out of step with the target audience, and let this book stay at my personal default of 3 stars.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32929.Goodnight_Moon,Goodnight Moon.txt
Won-Ton: A Cat Tale Told in Haiku,"A substitute teacher came up to my reference desk seeking, “Fun haiku books” to turn into lesson plans with their kids. That’s the sort of open-ended question that can render your brain blank for a moment or two. Suddenly every haiku book for kids you’ve ever encountered flees from your brain. You’re left gaping like a fish, desperately scanning your poetry shelves for one, just ONE, haiku book that will help. Then, if you’re really in trouble, you start thinking of books that are so new to your library system that it’s no good to remember them anyway. For instance, the last time this happened I found myself thinking ofWon Ton: A Cat Tale Told in Haiku. A spirited little story that couldn’t be simpler, the first person narrative of a feline in a new home is told entirely in haikus. With plenty of things to love for poetry and cat lovers alike,Won Tontakes an old form and renders it furry.Split into little unnumbered chapters (“The Shelter”, “The Choosing”, etc.) we hear the tale of a cat named Won Ton (though that’s not his “real” name, mind). A shelter kitty, Won Ton is adopted by a nice boy and goes off to start a new life. For a cat there are plenty of things to explore and figure out. There’s the couch that makes for an excellent scratching post and the moths that make for “a dusty snack”. In the end, Won Ton makes it clear that he’s not his boy’s cat. The boy ishisboy. And finally, “ ‘Good night, Won Ton,’ you / whisper. Boy it’s time you knew: / My name is Haiku.”It’s interesting that right off the bat the Author’s Note makes it clear that the book isn’t told in haiku at all but rather senryu. Actually, I’m being facetious. Senryu, which focuses on “the foibles of human nature – or in this case, cat nature” appears to have been developed from haiku itself. This would make it an ideal book for classroom study, then. We hear about kids that have to write their own haikus all the time. How many have to write senryus, eh?I liked that in the Dedication we learn that the author has cats named Mai Tai, Papaya, and Koloa. Won Ton isn’t all that kooky a name in comparison. As for the haikus themselves, they’re definitely less evocative and more driven by a deep and abiding knowledge of cat personalities. The repeated joke throughout the book are the haikus that go, “Letmeoutletme / outletmeoutletmeout. / Wait – let me back in!” These occur periodically throughout the book. Of course, I wondered how well this kind of poetry would read aloud. Often Wardlaw has to break apart a line mid-sentence with varying degrees of success. Some poems don’t require the continuous flow of a sentence from one line to another. Others get a bit confusing when the lines aren’t next to one another. In one long line, “Naptime! Begone, oh / fancy pad. I prefer these / socks. They smell of you” looks fine. Broken up it’s a little hard to read. For the most part, though, everything is fairly smooth.Eugene Yelchin is the illustrator paired with Ms. Wardlaw for this book and he’s an artist I’ve not seen much of before. Yelchin for this book has taken graphite and gouache to watercolor paper to create these images. His style is an elongated series of stretched lines, something akin to an artist likeJules Feiffer, though Yelchin reigns himself in a bit more. I particularly enjoyed his backgrounds. When Won Ton is in the shelter the background switches from plain white to gray or gray-blue or gray-pink. Then when the family returns home with their new cat, the artist takes a moment to render a landscape heavily influenced by older Japanese prints of mountainous backgrounds. Inside the home the colors brighten. Yellows and oranges and maybe a light blue. Patterned carpets and backyard scenes allow for more tips of the hat to Japanese prints, but not so much you’re taken out of the reading. Yelchin’s humans pretty much stay out of the picture, seen only in body parts until the boy’s face appears at the end as a kind of reward. As for Won Ton himself, the artist has clearly studied cats, and how much you take to it may depend on how much of a cat person you are. Yelchin’s hero is almost all outline. The shading is done well enough, but when you think back on the art, it’s the black outlines that remain in your mind. That seems to be the style that’s primarily at work here.When we think of famous poetical kitties the first thing that tends to come to mind isOld Possum’s Book of Practical Catsby T.S. Eliot. Actually, this book pairs pretty well withOld Possum, particularly when it comes to the naming of cats. Won Ton isn’t particularly fond of his human-bestowed name, and little wonder since he has a name of his own already. Much like the Jellicle Cats of Eliot’s world, this cat is the master of his moniker. The book also brought to mind one of my favorite feline poetry titlesA Curious Collection of Catsby Betsy Franco. Some of Won Ton’s habits here are replicated perfectly in Ms. Franco’s book. The two would read well together, I should think. As it stands, of course,Won Tonhas no difficulty standing on its own. A cheery ode to a boy and his cat, this is one of the books to grab the next time someone asks you for “fun haiku”. Or really, any poetry in general.For ages 4-8.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8411631-won-ton,Won-Ton A Cat Tale Told in Haiku.txt
"Hi, Koo!","I have a colleague who is mighty careful when it comes to haiku. She’s Japanese-American herself, and one thing she simply cannot stand is when someone takes a set of words, slaps them into five/seven/five syllable lines, and then calls the result “a haiku”. Traditional haiku focuses on nature and how we, as humans, relate to it. So what happens when 5/7/5 gets taken out of the equation entirely? Author/illustrator Jon J. Muth is no stranger to children’s picture books that challenge the reader. And though he’s written many a book touching on the concept of “Zen”, straight up poetry has rarely been his bag. All that changes with the publication ofHi, Koo!: A Year of Seasons. Gutsy in its quiet, contemplative way, Muth doesn’t follow the same old, same old poetry model. Maybe that’s part of the reason I like it so very much.Twenty-six haikus spotlight four different seasons. In the book, a panda cub named Koo and two human siblings explore fall, winter, spring and autumn in a myriad of different ways. From a snowball on a stop sign (“are we in trouble?”) to act of accidentally killing a bug (“afterward / feeling alone and Sad”) the haikus do double duty as both poems and, depending on which word is capitalized, a tour of the alphabet. Inspired by his own young twins, Muth, with seeming effortlessness, brings to young readers a fellow traveler.Poetry is dead. I’m sorry. That sounds a bit bleak. Allow me to rephrase that sentence. Poetry for children is dead. Nope . . . nope that still sounds bleak, doesn’t it? Well it’s not true anyway . . . yet. But you see I’ve been watching the number of works of poetry published for kids the last few years and I swear that each season we get fewer and fewer and fewer. I believe a combination of different factors is to blame. On the one hand, poetry doesn’t hold a spot of honor in some curriculum anymore and it’s not every school that has their kids memorize a whole poem these days. Add in the fact that the American Library Association presents no official award for a work of children’s poetry and the fact that a GOOD book of poetry is insanely hard to write and you’ve a decrease in the number being published every year. So imagine my relief when I discovered that Muth had thrown his hat in the ring. Haiku? I’ll take it! Whatever you’ve got, man. Lay it on me.Not that I was initially on board with the come-as-you-are attitude towards syllables in this book. Not at first. It took a careful reading of Muth’s Author’s Note (which thankfully is the first thing you read in the book) before I truly understood what was going on. As he explains, the original Japanese haiku is made of seventeen sound parts called “on”. But English syllables and “on” aren’t equivalent to one another. “Over time, haiku has evolved, so that many modern poets no longer adhere so rigidly to this structure.” Taking his cue, Muth strives to capture sensory images in his poems. “At its best, a haiku embodies a moment of emotion that reminds us that our own human nature is not separate from all of nature.” And heck, it’s not even as if Muth is the first guy in the world to ignore the now standard English syllabic scheme. Poet Harold G. Henderson went so far as to make his haikus rhyme. How’s that for originality?Does that mean that the book will have limited use in schools? Yeah, well maybe, but enterprising teachers will still find it to be amongst the best there are. Plus, as I say, it’s not like poetry’s getting as much play as it deserves these days. If the teacher insists on 5/7/5, there are lots of other books out there to choose from. And there may be objections even still from folks who adhere to the original definition of what a Haiku constitutes. For some, Haiku is a kind of basis for mediation as it applies to Zen philosophy. Yet even there, Muth tips his hat. Note the final page. There, in the dying twilight of a summer night, seated on a tree branch with a cardinal’s nest perched on his head, we hear Koo’s final poem. “becoming so quiet / Zero sound / only breath.” As Haikus for kids go, this is as Zen as it gets.So let’s ask the million-dollar question here. If Muth knows his Haiku history, does he follow its form? Which is to say, does each poem that he writes discuss nature or the seasons and how they relate to kids? Well, yes and no. With a regular cast of characters, these haikus tell a story together. One such poem reads, “Friend, is that you / knocking at the door? / TWO!” Look at the image and you see two heavily bundled kiddos standing outside Koo’s door, eager for him to play with them in the wintery white. Can an illustration play a part in conveying a seasonal aspect of a poem when the words in the poem itself do not? No idea, but if so then Muth's in the clear.Though it’s beautiful from start to finish, I think I should probably point out that this is a really fun, funny, amusing, infinitely readable book as well. My own copy was sitting on my dining room table when my two-year-old spotted it and started insisting I read her “the picture book”. I did and she got a real kick out of it (though the image of eyes gone square from too much TV kind of gave her the jim jams). As someone who purchases books for my library system it made me a little sad that I’ll be cataloging this book in the poetry section and not the picture book section. Sitting next to fellow Muth creationsZen Ties,Zen ShortsandZen GhostsI’d be able to guarantee its circulation. In poetry it’ll be a harder sell, but I’m willing to put it there if it lures Muth fans to the world of poem and verse.When a form of poetry is also a form of philosophy, you are naturally going to have some folks a bit peeved by its appropriation. By the same token, appropriation is the nature of art in America. I think perhaps it will be more likely that certain gatekeepers (teachers, parents, librarians, etc.) will find Muth’s refusal to toe the line and go 5/7/5 with his syllables far more of an annoyance. Consider the man’s justifications and ask yourself what truly is more important in a haiku. Is it form or is it feeling? April is Poetry Month and in an era of blackout poems, spine poetry, reversos, and whatever it is Bob Raczka was doing inLemonade(is there even a term for it?) we can afford to shake things up for our kids a little. Give haiku back its gravitas, and give your kids a book that also happens to be really fun (not to mention beautiful) as well.For ages 4-8.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17243953-hi-koo,"Hi, Koo!.txt"
Lemonade: and Other Poems Squeezed from a Single Word,"The lady from Manhattan would like to register a complaint. The lady from Manhattan is aware, perfectly aware, that there are plenty of fabulous children's poets in a given year. The lady from Manhattan would further state that she likes many of these authors and would like to review them more often but she feels that her hand is forced, FORCED I say, to instead review the works of one Bob Raczka. This, in her opinion, is unfair. Mr. Raczka should do everything in his power to write significantly less interesting books of children's poetry. Perhaps he should consider a collection of bad limericks. That would certainly lower the bar enough for one to review his brethren with impunity. Instead, when a book likeLemonadecomes across your plate, you have no choice but to review it. Brilliant and head-scratchingly insane by turns, Raczka writes one of the more inspiring books of poetry to come out in recent history. It really isn't fair in the least. The lady objects.Take a word. Now find as many words as you can out of that word. Now take those words and make a cohesive, coherent, and downright good poem. Impossible? Not if you ask Bob Raczka. Inspired by poet Andrew Russ's ""one-word poems"", Raczka manages to find and write twenty-two such poems. Sometimes they are short (the poem ""friends"" really just boils down to ""fred finds ed""). Sometimes they are longer than you'd expect (""spaghetti"" starts with ""papa has a pasta appetite""). And in each poem you have to read the letters as they appear under their starting words on one page, and then in order as a normal poem on the next. A clever literary technique yields even cleverer little poems. This is a premise that surpasses its initial gimmick.There are few books I have encountered that give you the feeling that you're learning to read all over again. This is one of the few. Just reading a single poem, no matter how short, can be a challenge. Because the letters drop down to appear under their respective letters in the title, they do not fall into natural spaces or breaks. The result is that you might read the words ""ivan in / ava in / ian in"" instead as ""ivan in a vain"". It almost feels like code breaking after a while (a not unpleasant sensation). Another advantage of the format is that certain poems mimic their subject matter. The poem ""moonlight"", for example, mimics its subject, a moth, flitting in concentric circles down a page.If you're tired of the old haiku you could do worse than to try blackout poems where you take newspaper articles and black out with a magic marker everything but a few words. Or how about spine poetry, where you create poems out of the titles of books piled on top of one another? Raczka's one-sentence poems are inspired by a fellow by the name of Andrew Russ. Yet while Russ may have come up with the notion of making poems from common letters, it was Raczka who recognized the real kid-potential of the form. As a result, I suspect thatLemonadeis not going to be the last one-sentence children's book of poetry we ever encounter in our lifetimes. It may, however, turn out to be the best.The technique Russ has come up with is, in a sense, a kind of natural derivation of those school assignments kids are given in school where they are given a vocabulary word and told to make as many words out of it as possible (as a kid my husband was told that the word ""id"" would not count since ""it wasn't a real word""). I imagine that schools still do this assignment, so how much harder would it be to follow in Russ and Raczka's footsteps and to take such assignments one step further saying, ""Now turn those words into a poem""? Not hard at all.The question of how to illustrate such a book is a puzzlement best left in the hands of capable editors. Considering that Raczka's last book was a collection of haikus (Guyku) and that this one is only slightly less sparse and spare, less may be more. The words are the star of the show here. Acknowledging this, the book places each poem with the black title and red poetry against a white background. Turn the page and the page becomes red, the words of the poem neat and orderly in little white rows. The illustrator tapped to fill some of these pages with art of her own is one Nancy Doniger, previously best known for creating the art for Sharon Taberski'sMorning, Noon, and Night(another book of poetry) andGingersnapsby Anita Alexander and Susan Payne. These books came out in 1998 and 1996 respectively, so it's clear that Ms. Doniger has had other things on her plate in the interim. In this book Doniger's palette is limited to black and red watercolor spot illustrations. The art itself keeps itself distinct from the poems. It never overpowers them or even, for that matter, really does anything to catch your eye. These pictures serve as mere filler, leaving the words the true star of the show. A person can read this whole book cover to cover and not remember a single image when they have finished. And that, quite frankly, is perfect for this kind of book.When Poetry Month comes around kids get bombarded with the same haiku or the same limerick assignments over and over again. I like to believe that Mr. Raczka might do something to change all of that. His is a book that inspires. You almost want to take your own first and last name after reading it and make poems out of those letters yourself. So thank you, Mr. Raczka, for bringing to light a great new poetic format. For inspiring adults and kids alike to write and create. And for making my life all the harder, forcing me to throw laudatory compliments your way, just because you do what you do so well. For all that sir, I thank you.For ages 4-10.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9371035-lemonade,Lemonade and Other Poems Squeezed from a Single Word.txt
Soup for Breakfast,"This is a super fun poetry book with some silly rhymes that will have you laughing and picturing the words as you read. This book speaks with individuality and encourages young readers to be themselves. This book is a great way to get readers thinking about what the words mean and how these poems are expressing an underlying message. This book also discusses many things young readers could relate to such as not liking breakfast foods, parking lots filled with cars, building with blocks, and many other things. I really enjoyed how encouraging this book is; the story of each poem is unique and gets the reader thinking. This book could be great as a read-aloud for any age elementary student as it could be used in many different ways. This book could be a good way to get students engaged and interested in reading as well as poetry specifically. Teachers could use this book to have students think about what the poems are communicating and could also be used to challenge students to write their own poems. Teachers could read the book aloud, assign groups of students each a poem in the ebook and have them work together to analyze and understand that poem. Then students could share with others what they found and what the indicators were that led them to their understanding of the poem. There are also many words in this book that could be introduced as vocabulary words to students. Teachers could identify and define them with students before reading. Acknowledge their appearance in the book and how it was used and then have students use the words throughout the day and add them to a word wall. I think this book should be introduced to students in the elementary classroom because it's humorous, has interesting illustrations that can help students picture what they are reading, and is very engaging and relatable.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3308832-soup-for-breakfast,Soup for Breakfast.txt
If I Were in Charge of the World and Other Worries,"Read forCBR 6In order to pass on my love of poetry to my niblings (and expand our horizons a tad bit beyond Where The Sidewalk Ends), my niece and I have recently spent some time exploring the 810s at our local library. One of our very first finds – and one of the biggest hits – is Judith Viorst’s If I Were in Charge of The World (and other worries). For my niece and I, the best kind of poetry is nonsense poetry – we’ve spent a lot of time with the king of all things kooky, Shel Silverstein, but, I knew there were other books, other poems, and other authors out there that we could enjoy as well.Viorst – probably best known for Alexander of the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day fame – is one of the ones that’s definitely worth searching out. (The book is from 1981, and I’m surprised I hadn’t read it as a child myself, because this would have been exactly the kind of thing a girl who memorized “Sick“ would have enjoyed, but I had never heard of it before.) The titular poem is my favorite, by far, with the author listing off things that would be out of here if s/he were boss – including allergy shots, bedtimes and Monday mornings- with a few things she’d like more of – like chocolate sundaes that count as vegetables – thrown in for good measure. That’s my favorite, but there are still many more worthwhile poems to be found in this book.There are descriptive poems (“Stanley the Fierce/Has a chipped front tooth/And clumps of spiky hair…. And I hear that he goes for seventeen days/Without changing his underwear./But I don’t think I’ll ask him.); and poems about enemies and poems about best friends; poems that sum up the experience of being told it’s time for bed (I hear eating./ I hear drinking./ I hear music./ I hear laughter. /Fun is something/ Grownups never have/ Before my bedtime. /Only after.). There are poetic takes on fairy tales and fantasies and forgetting to brush your teeth. There’s a few poignant ones scattered throughout – about a broken heart mending, or apologizing, or growing up. Oh my gosh, there’s the Teddy Bear Poem, which nearly made me weep, which I will include for you here, so you can also almost weep:I threw away my teddy bear,The one that lost his eye.I threw him in the garbage pail(I thought I heard him cry.)I’ve had that little teddy bearSince I was only two.But I’m much bigger now andI’ve got better things to doThan play with silly teddy bears.And so I said good-byeAnd threw him in the garbage pail.(Who’s crying – he or I?)Right??In addition to tugging on the heartstrings and making you chuckle, Viorst also uses space and text creatively – she squishes words here, lays them flat there. And there’s her spectacular take on weirdness, which is my niece’s favorite. It lists how all the people in the family are acting different than they normally would, then proclaims them all weird, while the text of the entire poem is upside down, emphasizing the point, but also illustrating that, perhaps, the author is a little bit weirder than s/he may have thought.And I’m saying s/he here for ‘the author’ even though I know full well that Judith Viorst is a woman, because the best thing about this kind of poetry, this first person perspective, is that kids are easily able to place themselves into the author’s shoes, to make believe that the poet is, in fact, them. So when she’s talking about her “Thoughts on getting out of a nice warm bed in an ice-cold house to go to the bathroom at three o’clock in the morning”, it’s easy enough for a kid to see themselves in that place, to agree with her conclusion “Maybe life was better/When I used to be a wetter.”The poems are short, most of them have a simple pattern and rhyme scheme, and almost all of them have an early-reader level vocabulary (My niece is 8, and there were only a few unfamiliar words, so I’d say 3rd grade independent level reading, probably, but you could read them with kids younger than that). Our only complaint was that there were far too few of them. But, after a bit of research, I found out that not only are there more Judith Viorst poems for kids (Sad Underwear & Other Complications), but she also has written quite a few books of humorous poetry for adults, which I will also be checking out (It’s Hard to Be Hip Over 30 & Other Tragedies of Married Life;How Did I Get To be 40?;When Did I Stop Being 20 & Other Injustices: Selected Poems from Single to Mid-Life; Forever 50 & Other Negotiations; Suddenly 60 & Other Shocks of Later Life; I’m Too Young to Be 70 & Other Delusions; Unexpectedly Eighty & Other Adaptations). I’m definitely going to be checking those out soon, and I recommend the poetry in this book for everybody (technically it’s for kids, but who cares about that: they’re good poems)",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/558665.If_I_Were_in_Charge_of_the_World_and_Other_Worries,If I Were in Charge of the World and Other Worries.txt
Giraffes Can't Dance,"This is a brilliant story and makes me remember the sheer excitement of exploring the world of exotic animals and the exciting places they lived. The story uses colourful illustrations and a rhythmical storyline which provides a musical and fast paced feel.The story is about a giraffe called Gerald who lives in the African plains of Kenya. The plains are filled with lively animals who just love to dance. Funny illustrations of waltzing warthogs, rock ‘n’ rolling rhinos and tangoing lions gives the story great humour and action. All the animals appear to be exceptional and talented dancers except for poor Gerald who just can’t seem to fit in and dance. As a result Gerald often gets teased by the other animals and after a rather embarrassing and critical moment at the Jungle Dance, Gerald is laughed out of town. With a little reflection and council from a wise old cricket, Gerald is freed from his self doubt with a lively and colourful twist. This message is written in an exciting and rhythmical way enhanced by the beautiful and colourful illustrations.I like this book as it has a positive message to deliver to children about finding your own style but also not to expect others to have the same abilities. It encourages them to be more open minded when they meet new people and enjoy the diversity of the world. Children will be able to identify the various creatures detailed in the book. The characters are loveable and humorous and the book has wonderful creative illustrations that set out the scenes.These books can support literacy by encouraging imagination and development of word language and can also inspire creative games, oral stories and writing in Y1 and lower Y2. The detailed illustrations ensure the story is used as visual aid on an interactive whiteboard. This book would also be appropriate for independent reading for developing readers as it has a variety of words that will extend the children’s vocabulary and interests.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/765148.Giraffes_Can_t_Dance,Giraffes Can't Dance.txt
Hush! A Thai Lullaby,"In this sweet and enchantingly lyrical marriage of text and images, in Minfong Ho'sHush! A Thai Lullaby, a Thai mother repeatedly admonishes the fauna in both her domicile and the neighbouring woods to ""hush"" (as her baby is supposedly sleeping). The presented onomatopoeic diverse animal sounds (from the wee-wee of a tiny mosquito to the hoom-praa of a massive elephant) combined with the soothing cadence and rhythm of the author's repetitive verses become increasingly soothing and almost somniferous (although ironically and very much humorously, even after all of the animals as well as the mother are indeed and finally fast asleep, the baby alone remains awake, his eyes bright, round and alert). Now while in and of themselves Holly Meade's accompanying illustrations are not what I would consider personal favourites (I love their general descriptive expressiveness and colour scheme, but the depictions of some of the domestic animals do seem a trifle stagnant and lacking expressivity if contrasted with, say, the lizard, the monkey and the elephant) they do work exceedingly well in conjunction with the text, not only mirroring but also quite massively expanding on Minfong Ho's verses (showing the architecture and layout of a typical Thai house, with its open concept living/sleeping quarters, the adjacent rice barn, but especially and with a delightful sense of visual irony demonstrating that all the while the mother is pleading with the animals to keep down their noise so as not to awaken her infant, the little nipper is actually not only wide awake but out and about, gallivanting around the house). Highly recommended isHush! A Thai Lullaby(and most definitely worthy of the Caldecott Honour Medal awarded, although on a personal reading enjoyment level, only a high three star book for me, lovely, descriptive but not spectacular).",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22208.Hush_A_Thai_Lullaby,Hush!

Poems in the Attic,"Title: Poems in the AtticAuthor: Nikki GrimesIllustrator: Elizabeth ZunonGenre: Picturebook of PoemsTheme: Moving, poetry, travelOpening Line/Sentence: Grandma’s attic is stacked with secrets.Brief Book Summary: A young girl finds her mother’s old poems in her grandmother’s attic and reads about her mom’s experiences moving around the world, since her father was in the military. The little girl writes her own poems alongside her mother’s and binds them together.Professional Recommendation/Review #1:http://www.clcd.com.ezaccess.librarie...Edie Ching (Booklist, Apr. 15, 2015 (Vol. 111, No. 16))A book about discoveries, this celebrates poetry and the quixotic life of a military family. A young girl responds in free verse to the poems she uncovers in the attic, poems her mother wrote in tanka (a form of Japanese poetry) about the wonder of her experiences living throughout the world. The mother’s voice dominates through longer poems and Zunon’s larger illustrations, but the daughter’s poems appear first on each page, and the connection between the poems is heartfelt. Their love of language and the natural world bind them together. There is also a rhythm to their experiences as well (the daughter writes of sand castles, and the mother, of a grunion run). Notes encourage readers to try their hands at either poetic form, while the pictures, a combination of acrylic, oil, and collage, encourage interest in the many places described. Pair with How I Discovered Poetry, by Marilyn Nelson (2014), for a slightly older audience interested in writing poetry and understanding the turmoil and adventure of being raised in a military family.Professional Recommendation/Review #2:http://www.clcd.com.ezaccess.librarie...Midwest Book Review (Children's Bookwatch, November 2015)Poems in the Attic"" is a sensitive collection of two sets of memories captured in two verse styles, tanka, and free verse. The poems celebrate and explore the experience of moving from place to place as the child of an Air Force military family. One set of poems is discovered by the heroine, a young African American girl, in her attic. She is amazed to discover they were written by her mother about her experiences moving with her grandfather when she was a girl. The girl decides to also write poems, to ""keep all my rememberings safe..."" The tanka poems are brief, descriptive, and evocative, compressed verse in five lines, varying between five and seven syllables each. The original form of tanka poetry comes from Japan. The girl's mother wrote her poems in tanka, while the girl writes hers in free verse. A deeply moving story unfolds, in which two girls find solace from loneliness and change in their ability to write poetry. Here is one poem in free verse: Grandma Says / Memories can be like sandcastles / the waves wash away. / My mama glued her memories with words / so they would last forever. ""Poems in the Attic"" was chosen as a Junior Library Guild selection for excellent reasons. Tender, lyrical illustrations in acrylic, oil, and collage show mother and daughter as girls in different settings around the world where US Air Force bases exist. A list of eleven different such Air Force Bases is included in the ending pages, mapping out the journeys made by many military families and children to be with their parent(s) in military service. Inspired by stories shared with friends as well as the author's own experiences, ""Poems in the Attic"" explores the reality of a childhood in transition, using writing to help cope with multiple challenges of growing up a ""military brat.”Response to Two Professional Reviews: I agree with both of these reviews because the poetry is beautiful. It really captures emotions and the connections between mother and daughter, as well as imagery and figurative language. It’s a great book of poems that explains what moving around all the time is like when your family is in the military.Evaluation of Literary Elements: Each picture throughout the book has the characters moving diagonally, which also symbolizes the constant moving around that military families do. Throughout most of the book, the mother is shown as the center of attention as she moves from place to place, which draws the reader’s attention to her. The characters are looking up to the sky when they’re happy and down at the ground when they are sad, further conveying emotion.Consideration of Instructional Application: For a minilesson, I would talk about both types of poems that are used in the story (free verse and tanka), as well as the figurative language and imagery that are incorporated into these poems. After the read aloud, I would have my students write poems of their own (either tanka or free verse) and I would encourage them to use figurative language and strong imagery. I could connect this story to other content areas by discussing the different parts of the world that are mentioned in the story. I could plan a geography lesson, as well as a lesson on culture and have my students do a project on whichever country from the story they choose.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22162514-poems-in-the-attic,Poems in the Attic.txt
A Full Moon Is Rising,"This is a great book of poems that illustrates how different people experience the full moon all around the world. We are faced with the fascinating fact that the same moon makes an appearance for everyone on earth. The people in the story express feelings, traditions, and beliefs they have surrounding the time of the full moon. Readers get to put themselves in the shoes of those around the world. It shows how we are all connected, yet very different. Therefore, the focus is on the full moon as well as different cultures around the world. The book also provides a world map that highlights the different countries that are represented in the story.Lexile shows that this book is appropriate for children that are 8-9 years old. I agree with this rating as I think it would be great to use in a third grade lesson relating to North Carolina standards:RL.3.2 Recount stories, including fables, folktales, and myths from diverse cultures; determine the central message, lesson, or moral and explain how it is conveyed through key details in the text.RL.3.5 Refer to parts of stories, dramas, and poems when writing or speaking about a text, usingterms such as chapter, scene, and stanza; describe how each successive part builds on earlier sections.3.E.1 Recognize the major components and patterns observed in the earth/moon/sun system.In my third grade classroom, I would read this aloud to model poetry characteristics while students are studying the phases of the moon. This should be read before they observe the full moon. After reading, we would discuss the characteristics of the writing that made them poems. We would discuss rhyming and figurative language then review where the author used those concepts within the story. Students would be instructed to view the full moon that night and note the time they view it. The following day, they would be prompted to write their own poem about their experience viewing the moon. They would create a title for their poem and specify the town they were in when they viewed it along with the time they viewed it. I would collect their poems and combine them to make a class book of their collection of poems to look like A Full Moon is Rising. We would then read their poems, giving them the opportunity to read their own poem when we turn to that page. A discussion would follow to note the poetry characteristics they used, the distance and movement of the moon, how it connects us, and how similar or different their experiences were. It would be fun for them to acknowledge that they were all looking at the same moon at the exact or close to the same time.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9749030-a-full-moon-is-rising,A Full Moon Is Rising.txt
Pete the Cat: Rocking in My School Shoes: A Back to School Book for Kids,"Pete the Cat: Rocking in My School Shoes by Eric Litwin (2011) Illustrated by James DeanJoin Pete the cat as he rocks his school shoes through the classroom, library, lunchroom, playground, and even the bus! Written by author, musician, and song-writer Eric Litwin, the reading of the book evokes a musical tune as Pete’s “rocking his school shoes” refrain is repeated at every location he visits. Beautifully illustrated with paintings by James Dean, the lines, color, and texture transport readers to Pete’s side on his journey through school with his special shoes. The illustrations vary in perspective from wide angles to zoom-in shots as well as multiple collages that allow readers to see just how busy Pete the cat is rocking his school shoes. Text fonts vary in size and color and serve to accentuate the illustrations as well set up a visually easy-to-read storyline. Inside covers of the book display Pete on the bus, and the outside hard-covers of the book reviewed, were colorful and have an eye-catching glossy finish. While this book has the approximate page count typical of a picture book. It is important to note that none of the pages are numbered. This might be problematic with young readers learning numbers and sequences, but it does not detract from the book aesthetically or from a storyline/arc perspective. A fun-to-read book with lively, colorful artwork, and one of the many Pete the Cat books in a large series, this book would make a good addition to any primary school library or kindergarten class.Awards: South Carolina Book Award for Picture Book (2014), Monarch Award (2013)Target Audience: Pre-k to 2nd grade or ages 3-7",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9466024-pete-the-cat,Pete the Cat Rocking in My School Shoes A Back to School Book for Kids.txt
I Like Myself!,"[As a first-grader] I love reading the book aloud because of the word rhymes. The pictures are funny, and the little girl seems to be full of energy, just like me. I think she is very brave and confident, as she loves herself inside and out. She loves her body, emotions, and behaviors, and doesn’t care about what others think of her. I agree that we are unique and I like myself too. However, that doesn’t mean we can just do whatever we like. For example, the girl jumped onto something that looks like a tall water fountain or flower basin (by the way, the pages are not numbered) — ”I’m having too much fun, you see, for anything to bother me!” Well, i AM bothered because what if she gets injured? What if she breaks the property? For me, I think it’s good that we appreciate our uniqueness, but we need to follow rules, such as stay safe and respect others. For this reason, I like the book “I Am Who I Am” by Bruno Hächler and Iris Wolferman better. It’s a board book for younger kids, and encourages children to explore who they are, “ I’m everything that I can be. I’m the person who is me!”[As the parent helping my first-grader read and write] To be frank, I have mixed feelings toward this book. On the positive side, the words were carefully chosen to form catchy rhymes. The pictures were colorful and vibrant, and reminds me of Dr. Seuss’ style. The content focused on appreciating ourselves for who we are, both physically and mentally, in order to foster and establish self-esteem. However, we as individuals belong to a family, a classroom, a team, a workplace and in all, a society. There are established norms and rules that individuals are expected to follow, especially for young children. If my child has “beaver breath” or “stinky toes”, she needs to brush her teeth or wash her feet more often, or go see a doctor if needed. I personally wouldn’t encourage my child to claim she’d still like herself that way. It’s controversial about having “hippo hips” and I respect each side of the argument. However, if it’s due to lack of exercise or unhealthy food choice, I would encourage my child to exercise more and eat more balanced meal. To summarize, I would like to encourage children to (1) be proud of who they are, as this book promotes, (2) take good care of their body by making appropriate choices, and (3) learn to appreciate others and the world around us.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/109521.I_Like_Myself_,I Like Myself!.txt
A Child's Calendar,"A Child's Calendar by John Updike is a children's book in the Poetry genre. This book is fit for elementary students, grades K-5. Updike takes a lyrical approach to the descriptions of the 12 calendar months of the year. Through illustrations and words, the author takes us on a journey of emotions, memories and activities that occur within a family for each month. Reading this book will bring you back to your childhood and each emotion that was felt as you spent your time with your family from month to month.In the classroom (specifically Kindergarten) , this book could be used for the purpose of teaching the calendar months to your students. As we reviewed the months, I would have the students create a collage of different things they associate with each month. Along with the collage, they will need to write one word/phrase/sentence that sums up their feelings about this month. This would fulfill Art standards and Common Core Standards.Another activity this book can be used for is to provide instruction for descriptive language in your writing. A Child's Calendar can be used as a mentor text for helping students apply descriptive language to their writing. As a class, we will read through the text and we will highlight, or point out, words that provide description to what the author is talking about. After we review the students will then apply this descriptiveness to their own poetry. This will fulfill ELA Standards.This is a WOW book for me because the author truly was able to bring me back to my own childhood memories. Each poem for the month I could imagine all the activities I would participate in and each feeling I would feel during that specific month. The author's descriptive and lyrical nature made this book very enjoyable to read. I know my students will enjoy this book and I can't wait to be able to use this in my classroom.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/235846.A_Child_s_Calendar,A Child's Calendar.txt
It's Weird to Grow a Beard,"My son (6) and I reviewed this book for Mother Daughter Book Reviews. Here are excerpts from our reviews. For the full reviews please visit our website.SON SAYS:I really liked the pictures because they were silly. There are lots of funny pictures like the cat with the frog in his throat, the sandwich that goes all the way to space, and the earth that is wearing a birthday hat and is tooting a horn. My favorite poems are “A Frog in a Puss” because the picture looks funny and the story is funny. I also liked the one about the sandwich, “nelly shmagessen owned a delicatessen”. I liked the poem “Stan the Man” because the gravy house looks cool, but you can’t really build a house out of gravy.In the poem about the nose, it didn’t make sense to me in the lines that say, “He’s never wrong because he’s always right.” [Mom: I tried to explain this line to him, but he still thinks there's something wrong with the sentence. Sigh...]I really loved, loved the book. I like reading poems and I sort of like writing them too. I think kids 2 years old to 11 years old would like this book. I think their parents would like it too.MOM SAYS:It’s Weird to Grow a Beard by Neal Fox is a delight. The poems included in this collection range in length and format, but they all have one thing in common: they are silly and fun and they are accompanied by some colourful kid-friendly illustrations. Some poems are just intended to entertain, such as Hominy Grits? which is a bit of a tongue-twister, similar to “how much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?” Others are lengthier and contain an important life lesson. For example, in Why Not! the author shares that he’s always marched to a different drummer despite being looked down upon for being different.While I enjoyed all the poems, I must admit that I did take issue with the poem entitled Nobody’s Stupid One Hundred Percent. While I understand the underlying message (i.e., there is always something you are good at), I just don’t want my children (or anyone else) to even identify themselves as any percentage stupid. I always tell my kids that no one is “stupid” but sometimes people do “stupid things”. So, the behaviour is stupid, not the person. Anyways, that is just one of my issues, and overall, the poem itself has a very positive message centred on developing self-esteem.My Bottom Line:It’s Weird to Grow a Beard is filled with whimsical and plain old silly rhyming fun. The illustrations really add to the experience of reading the poems and this collection of poems will be sure to entertain children between the ages of 3 and 10.

A Stick Is an Excellent Thing: Poems Celebrating Outdoor Play,"If the helicopter parents don't smother `em then the death of recess by test-minded schools will. Kids today have a heck of a time playing like they used to. Excuse me while I pull out my Crusty Old Fogey Hat which allows me to lament an era where kids gets their afternoons booked up and their free time minimized. I freely acknowledge that this is hardly a universal problem, but it does exist in some places. There are kids out there who would give anything just to run down their block without having to check in with their parents every five minutes. To them, I handA Stick is an Excellent Thing. A small picture book of poetry, Marilyn Singer taps into a kid's desire to be a kid (as well as an adult's sense of nostalgia, if I'm going to be honest here) to create a little world of fun. She is aided in her scheme by the multi-talented illustrator LeUyen Pham who not only brings this world to life but peoples it with kind, energetic, recognizable faces. The result is a book the celebrates games, playing, the great outdoors (no matter where you might be), and, in a roundabout manner, friends.In spite of itsA Hole Is to Digtype title, the book is more about the worlds kids create when they get together. In eighteen poems we see eighteen different ways to play. From mud soup to collecting fireflies, from swinging to plain old everyday sticks, these poems take a great thrill in showing kids at their best. Which is to say, having fun. Accompanying each poem are illustrations by LeUyen Pham. Where Singer creates the framework, Pham creates the world. Her kids exist in that bubble where adults are on the periphery, present when you need them, invisible when you don't. Through her art you not only get a sense of the game, you find it near impossible not to want to jump in and join.The poems themselves are light, airy little things. Conflict really doesn't exit in them. The closest we get is a kid getting ready to find another in a game of hide and seek or the sudden cry of ""You're a clown!"" I might have liked at least one instance of a quieter sadder emotion aside from the relentless cheer found here. Even old Monkey in the Middle is seen as a fun time rather than the world's oldest form of teasing. But then, how easy is it to play a game with a tinge of sadness to it? At least there's ""Hide and Seek"" where a boy hidden in a willow tree imagines he's in Brazil amongst evocative daydreams of snakes and birds.I liked that Ms. Singer included not just the games that kids will already know but the games kids tend to make up. I know that when I was a child we made up all sorts of crazy games with names like Barracuda (you may question whether or not it was inspired by the Heart song). In fact I wouldn't be too surprised if some kids try out the version of Statues found in this book.A Stick is an Excellent Thingisn't meant to be a guidebook but it might well end up fulfilling that purpose anyway.Illustrator LeUyen Pham's job here was a near impossible one. It was up to her to conjure up this world of jump ropes and sprinklers with an eye on classic children's tropes. I'm talking about the stereotypical ""good old days"" adults are always bemoaning the disappearance of. A time when a stick could be a toy, consarn it! The problem with this is the fact that if you find books about American kids playing like this in older children's books, I can guarantee you that they'll all be white white white. So Pham has created an ethnically diverse cast of characters. Fortunately for us she gives them individual personalities, so that by reading the book over and over again you recognize them from one scene to another. Another difference from the days of yore would also be the fact that gender roles are generally left in the dust. Here you'll see skateboarding girls and boys who help turn the double dutch ropes. A relief, to say the least.I spent a strange amount of time attempting to determine whether or not these kids lived in a city, the suburbs, or the country. Pham places her children in a safe world where they can run wild, impervious to harm. You will find no scraped knees, scary strangers, tears, or fears in her little world. Instead there are clean sidewalks ideal for jacks or jump roping, and grassy areas behind the houses where kids summersault down hills or capture fireflies, depending on the time of day. In the end I finally figured that Pham is creating a book that can appeal to all kids in all places. City kids will recognize the concrete places. Country kids will know what it means to go head over heels down a knoll or to use trees as hiding spot. She makes it universal, even as the poems do that in their own way as well.What is the purpose of a book such as this? Is it meant to be given to kids with the intention of reflecting what they already know? Is it meant to entice them away from their video games and computer screens? For guidance I turned to the descriptive bookflap where it talks about the book and ends with saying that these poems ""will make you want to hurry outside and join in the fun!"" Certainly for the lonely child or the kid who does not make playmates easily this book offers a glimpse into a pastoral eden. Here kids flit about in a friendly manner without the imposition of adults. They play unencumbered by schedules or timetables. They just play and with good friends. Reason enough to celebrate, I think.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12225739-a-stick-is-an-excellent-thing,A Stick Is an Excellent Thing Poems Celebrating Outdoor Play.txt
A Pizza the Size of the Sun,"A Pizza in the Sun by Jack Prelutsky is a book that is a collection of fun and engaging poems for readers of all ages. Prelutsky engages readers in a different variety of poems that are silly in some but overall a bunch of fun to read. The interesting thing about Prelutsky’s book is that even though the cover is full of cover, illustrator James Stevenson left off color in his illustrations throughout the different poems in the book. I think this can help students engage more with the poems and all they have to offer and teach students about the components of different poems. The diversity of Prelutsky's writing makes this such an effective book for students to learn about the different characteristics of poetry. Although the topics all differ, you can find humor in everything that Prelutsky creates which makes it such a versatile book to have in your classroom. There are several poems that can be used for a variety of lessons and read alouds to engage with different readers in different grades. I would use this book with third through fifth graders to pick a specific poem and have them recreate it with the style and layout that Prelutsky has but with a topic that they feel passionate about. Students would have to have the same characteristics as the chosen poem does to help teach them about what makes up a poem. With students I would choose to do a read aloud to engaged students in an expressive text that could end up being used as a guided reading book later on after an introduction to it. The different range of vocabulary that this book of poems provides will help supplement the read aloud while students are engaging with it to create a great vocab lesson that would be effective for any grade. This book was a WOW book for me because of how engaged and hooked I was into this book about poems. I know right away that if I was into this book as much as I was, that students will be engaged and get a lot out of this book. I really liked that the poems seemed to take their own shape as they were telling their story and how well Prelutsky engages with the reader's imaginations.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203154.A_Pizza_the_Size_of_the_Sun,A Pizza the Size of the Sun.txt
Tap Dancing on the Roof: Sijo,"This is another book that is a pleasure to hold as well as read. The format is square and smaller than most picture books. Inside, the paper is of good quality and provides a nice gleam to the whimsical illustrations.Linda Sue Park introduces young readers to a Korean form of poetry,sijo. They are short poems that try to end with an unexpected, sometimes funny, twist at the end. The poems provide plenty of material for the Hungarian illustrator, Istvan Banyai. His figures barely stay on the page as they rollick and zoom around. While color does make an appearance here and there, the majority of the illustrations stay in a grey-black-white scheme more familiar to graphic novels than kids books. In color or not, the roly-poly tot that traverses the pages is endearing and sometimes more compelling than the poems.The poem from which the title takes its name is one of my favorites, ""Long Division.""""This number gets a wall and a ceiling. Nice and comfy in there.But a bunch of other numbers are about to disrupt the peace---bumping the wall, digging up the cellar, tap dancing on the roof.""Banyai has a bunch of tots swarming over a huge long division symbol that reminded me of a construction crew. Sometimes the illustrations are a bit much for the small page they must occupy. Another favorite poem, ""Important Announcement,"" describes a delicious moment heralding spring, but I must admit, the scene is more apocalyptic than joyous with a giant shadow looming over the bunny rabbits and squirrels. But, overall, the illustrations are excellent.Sometimes, Park's poems get overwhelmed by Banyai's dominating pictures, but I did appreciate most of them. These are definitely lines to be read aloud and not just in your head. Park hones in on the daily life of children and colors scenes with a child's non-linear imagination. There are three ways to explore this book with children: plum vocabulary, searching for the ""twists,"" and going coo-coo for the illustrations.Not for people who like the cutesy end of the kid lit spectrum. Definitely for people looking to put poems in their pockets during April, National Poetry Month.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1901077.Tap_Dancing_on_the_Roof,Tap Dancing on the Roof Sijo.txt
Here's a Little Poem: A Very First Book of Poetry,"I know we're not supposed to use this word, but I have to: this book is ADORABLE! I really love children's poetry. I love when it is written from the perspective of a kid, especially when they are talking to their parents. And you know that the poet writing it is not a kid as they write it, they are probably a parent themselves and thinking about their own kid. <3 At first I thought it would be too simplistic, but they are seriously darling. For me, I remember there were certain illustrations of my favorite books which were my favorite. My mom and I had inside jokes about those illustrations. These ones by Polly Dunbar have the potential to be those for other kids! They are quirky and cute. The one on page 39 of the grandpa might be my favorite. The way the kids are so tiny and he looks so content. Also the one of the two little kids on page 71. And the rain on 72 and 74. And page 94. I also like how this physical book is large and the illustrations cover the whole page. It's great for little kids and great for reading aloud so that everybody can see. I would love love love to read this to kids. They'd probably pick out their favorite poem and illustration. They could memorize their favorite poem. That would be a great idea for a kindergarten class. (Favorites: Cat Kisses by Bobbi Katz, Happy Birthday - traditional British street rhyme, Your Birthday Cake by Rosemary Wells, Bananas and Cream by David McCord, Beach Time by Marilyn Singer, April Rain Song by Langston Hughes, Night Bear by Lee Bennett Hopkins, Sleepy Song by Clare Bevan, Silverly by Dennis Lee, No Need to Light a Night-Light by Anonymous, The Early Morning by Hilaire Belloc).

Runny Babbit: A Billy Sook,"Definitely a very creative work ofShel Silverstein(1930-1999) who is also the author of the 1964 book, ""The Giving Tree"" that I enjoyed so much I bought copies of which and gave away to my friends. I think I did that in 2001 not knowing that he just died a couple of years back. I also only learned that he's already dead by reading the Wiki while composing this review. Felt so sad.The story's main protagonist isRunny Babbitwhose actual name is Bunny Rabbit but for unknown reason he and all the animals in the story, i.e., Toe Jurtle, Skertie Gunk, Rirty Dat, Dungry Hog, Snerry Jake, etc., interchange the first letter of the two words of their names and most the other two-word phrases when they talk to each other. I had to adjust a bit at the start but eventually gained speed halfway the book. Just like any typical children's book, the story is composed of several independent funny events in the life of Runny Babbit and his friends and each story varies in my laugh barometer from mild, medium and outright funny. Hey, some are even cheesy or heartwarming (which should be for parents to enjoy).The drawings are hilarious! They are in black-and-white and done in simple way but the imagination of the illustrator is just awesome. They effectively complement the free-verse poems (that tell the stories). My favorites are ""His Kajesty, the Ming"" (pp. 19) with Runny's friends lining up while bowing down to him in respect and ""Killy the Bird"" (pp. 45) with the same set of friends lining up in surrender to Runny atop a horse with his gun. You should see their faces. Soo cute!During Christmastime, I normally give away to my friends and officemates the books that I enjoyed but do not plan to re-read. Many of those books are children's books since nobody in my family is interested to read that genre. However, this one I will keep for future re-reads. Also I still have to play the CD. Since my daughter is already 15 going 16, I think I will reserve that one when I already have grandchildren hopefully around 10 years from now.You who gave me this last Dec 18: you know who you are and I thank you for the friendship that I will be remembering everytime I see this book.

"I, Too, Am America","Text to TextThis book told a story in an amazingly similar and amazingly different way than the book I read right after it, ""This is the Rope."" Both focused on the journey African Americans have taken in America and the struggles they have faced. ""I, Too, Am American"" shows how the porters shared their knowledge with others so everyone would have the an equal opportunity to learn. They were distributing their knowledge in hopes for a better future for the next generation. This story explained through a poignant poem and large illustrations full of meaning in and of themselves. In ""This is the Rope,"" the story shows how one family had this same dream for their children and passed down hopes, dreams, and aspirations for their children. The meaning was a bit more obvious in this book and did not speak to the same all-encompassing audience, but instead shared a more personal story that readers will hopefully be able to relate to as well.1.

"Once, I Laughed My Socks Off - Poems for kids","This book has a small collection of poems that are fun and a way to engage kids. The book can help develop kids curiosity and love of poetry by giving them an opportunity to explore poems they can relate too by using their imagination. What I enjoyed about the book is all the imagery is the poems gives. It's easy for a student to be able to picture themselves in some of the poems. My favorite poem in the book is Bingo the Boo. I can imagine every child looking and their room and thinking to themselves ""how did it get this way?"" It is a situation everyone can relate to, and a fun way to read about a messy room.The book would be great to use with the upper elementary grades (grade 3 and above). This poem book does not come with any pictures. It would be a wonderful way to show how figurative language is used and with different examples of poems in the book. Students can discuss the poems with each other and see different elements of poetry used. Students can also focus on literal and nonliteral elements found in poems and ask big questions like why did the author use these words? Where do poets get their ideas and inspiration. The author of the book has other poetry books as well for students to dive deep into some of the authors work, and write about it.

The Foot Book: Dr. Seuss's Wacky Book of Opposites,"Theodor Seuss Geiselwas born 2 March 1904 in Springfield, Massachusetts. He graduated Dartmouth College in 1925, and proceeded on to Oxford University with the intent of acquiring a doctorate in literature. At Oxford he met Helen Palmer, who he wed in 1927. He returned from Europe in 1927, and began working for a magazine called Judge, the leading humor magazine in America at the time, submitting both cartoons and humorous articles for them. Additionally, he was submitting cartoons to Life, Vanity Fair and Liberty. In some of his works, he'd made reference to an insecticide called Flit. These references gained notice, and led to a contract to draw comic ads for Flit. This association lasted 17 years, gained him national exposure, and coined the catchphrase ""Quick, Henry, the Flit!""In 1936 on the way to a vacation in Europe, listening to the rhythm of the ship's engines, he came up with And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, which was then promptly rejected by the first 43 publishers he showed it to. Eventually in 1937 a friend published the book for him, and it went on to at least moderate success.During World War II, Geisel joined the army and was sent to Hollywood. Captain Geisel would write for Frank Capra's Signal Corps Unit (for which he won the Legion of Merit) and do documentaries (he won Oscar's for Hitler Lives and Design for Death). He also created a cartoon called Gerald McBoing-Boing which also won him an Oscar.In May of 1954, Life published a report concerning illiteracy among school children. The report said, among other things, that children were having trouble to read because their books were boring. This inspired Geisel's publisher, and prompted him to send Geisel a list of 400 words he felt were important, asked him to cut the list to 250 words (the publishers idea of how many words at one time a first grader could absorb), and write a book. Nine months later, Geisel, using 220 of the words given to him publishedThe Cat in the Hat, which went on to instant success.In 1960 Bennett Cerf bet Geisel $50 that he couldn't write an entire book using only fifty words. The result wasGreen Eggs and Ham. Cerf never paid the $50 from the bet.Helen Palmer Geisel died in 1967. Theodor Geisel married Audrey Stone Diamond in 1968. Theodor Seuss Geisel died 24 September 1991.Also worked under the pen name:Theo Le Sieg",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/105548.The_Foot_Book,The Foot Book Dr. Seuss's Wacky Book of Opposites.txt
When Green Becomes Tomatoes: Poems for All Seasons,"I don’t think I can adequately stress to you the degree to which I did not want to review this book. Not because it isn’t a magnificent title. And not because it isn’t pleasing to both eye and ear alike. No, it probably had more to do with the fact that it’s a work of poetry. I make a point of reviewing poetry regularly, though I’d be the first to say that it wasn’t my first language (if you know what I mean). I respect it but can occasionally find it tough going. I was determined to give this book its due, though. And the only way I could make myself physically sit down and review it was to read it cover to cover again. As I did so I was struck over and over, time and again, by just how melodious the language is here. Look, I’ll level with you. Seasonal poetry books are a dime a dozen. But what Fogliano and Morstad have created together is a lot more than just a book of poems for the changes of the year. This book manages to operate on a level that presents the very act of the seasonal cycle as positively philosophical, yet without distancing itself from its readership. It’s tricky territory, but together Fogliano and Morstad get the job done.“from a snow-covered tree / one bird singing / each tweet poking / a tiny hole / through the edge of winter”. In the very first poem inWhen Green Becomes Tomatoes(a poem called “march 20”) the child reader is alerted to a change in the air. The snow is still present and the weather still gloomy, but there is hope on the horizon. Yet rather than turn the book into a paean to warmer weather, poet Julie Fogliano takes time to both celebrate and criticize the passing seasons. By the end of spring you look forward to summer and the end of summer leads to the relief of autumn, and so on and such. Accompanying these thoughts are small poems in lowercase and illustrations carrying the weight and expectations these seasons evoke in us. The end result can only be described in a single word: beautiful.Like I said, I’ve read a lot of poetry books for kids about the seasons in my day. The good ones have some kind of a hook. Like Joyce Sidman tackling it with colors inRed Sings from Treetopsor Jon J. Muth writing the poems entirely as haikus as inHi, Koo! A Year in Seasons. But Fogliano doesn’t really have a hook, and so I approached the title with trepidation. No hook? You mean it was just going to be . . . poems?! It takes the courage of your convictions to do a poetry book for kids straight these days. And it’s not true that Fogliano didn’t have one ace up her sleeve. A lot of works of poetry start in January (when the year itself technically begins). Using a technique of highlighting random dates, this poet begins the book on March 20th, the first day of spring. A small hook, sure, but at least it's something.As for the poems themselves, I was impressed not just with the writing, but with Ms. Fogliano’s grasp of what each season actually entails. There are a LOT of cloudy days, rainy days, and generally blah days in this book. They don’t weigh down the narrative or really make it all that gloomy. You just end up experiencing precisely the same feeling you have when you’re living those days. This is the rare book that acknowledges that spring doesn’t immediately mean sunshine and 55-degree temperatures. There’s a lot of snow and some mud and a whole ton of rain. Listen to how she puts it, though: “today / the sky was too busy sulking to rain / and the sun was exhausted from trying / and everyone / it seemed / had decided / to wear their sadness / on the outside / and even the birds / and all their singing / sounded brokenhearted / inside of all that gray.” It really isn’t until June that things even out, and I respect that. All the seasons are like that. It’s great to watch.As you might have noted, the poetry found in this book straddles a line between being child-friendly and introspective (the two aren’t mutually exclusive, but neither are they always natural pairs). I found myself noting line after line after line that I wanted to quote. Here’s a small taste for each season.On Spring: “shivering and huddled close / the forever rushing daffodils / wished they had waited.”On Summer: “if you ever stopped / to taste a blueberry / you would know / that it’s not really about the blue, at all.”On Fall: “october please / get back in bed / your hands are cold / your nose is red / october please / go back to bed / your sneezing woke december.”On Winter: “a gust of wind / blew by my nose / i think i will be frozen soon / this living room / (all cozy chairs and fireplace) / has some real explaining to do.”Some books of children’s poetry lean heavily on the works of other poets. I won’t presume to name her influences but if the July 12th poem is any indication then William Carlos Williams might have had some influence here. And maybe e.e. cummings too (with all that mudlicious mud).When she was much younger it’s clear that author Julie Fogliano made some kind of a blood sacrifice to the God of Perfect Illustrator Pairings. How else to explain how she has managed to work alongside such artists as Erin E. Stead and now Julie Morstad? Morstad is no newbie to the field, of course. I’ve been a big fan of her for years, starting with her art forThe Swingby Robert Louis Stevenson. Morstad’s great talent lies not necessarily in her waiflike black-eyed children, but rather in how she creates tone. Though there are plenty of sequences in this book of kids playing together or sharing food and soup, for the most part her characters go it alone. These poems are the contemplations of a young person with time and space and nature in spades. I don’t know that if I read Ms. Fogliano’s poetry without the art I would have picked up on that myself. Note too how cyclical the book is. The first poem is the last, sure as shooting, but so too is the person seen at both the beginning and the end. It’s the same kid wearing the same clothes, which makes a subtle implication that though a whole year has gone by, time is simply doubling back on itself. Not sure what to make of that one, frankly.With poetry, we have to play the game of answering what ages we think the poems are appropriate for. This book poses a bit of a challenge on that front. Some are younger, some definitely older. This mix will allow kids of all ages to take part in the fun, even as the book asks questions like whether or not there is a space between where things begin and things end “or just a slow and gentle fading”. Enticing to the eye but, more importantly almost, alluring to the brain as kids parse what Fogliano is trying to say, this is a book that has the potential (with the right teacher or parent) to convert the formerly unconvertible to the wonders of poetry itself. The truth of the matter is this: Fogliano and Morstad will make poets of us all.For ages 6 and up.",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25332008-when-green-becomes-tomatoes,When Green Becomes Tomatoes Poems for All Seasons.txt
Hungry for Math: Poems to Munch On,"This colorful book is a wonderful reminder that Math is all around us. My young reader wanted to dive into it right away. She loved the big beautiful illustrations !I must admit, I loved to read some of the poems out loud to her, I don’t know who had more fun ?!This book is a great way to introduce some simple math concepts to children. (Skip Counting, Symmetry etc. There is a small lexicon in the back of the book as well with more terminology)Hungry for Math would make for a great addition to a classroom library as well. It’s a great trampoline to further certain math notions. I can easily see this book being used in the classroom, The Spendasour would definitely make a fun way to introduce counting money.For me, the fact that I can get my children to go beyond the writing and the imagery is a huge bonus.. They can not only seek shapes in The Shape of Things but then we can go around the house and find some too !! My personal favorite was The Balanced Bee. “Now fold your paper. It’s plain to see. Bees are balanced. It’s symmetry!”The illustrations are fun and colorful, the writing is witty and entertaining.. it’s a superb book for children ! The trio responsible for this beautiful book are three Canadian women, Kari-Lynn Winters, Lori Sherritt-Fleming and Peggy Collins !!Combining poetry, art and math… it’s not only fun it is also educational !(I’m guilty of overusing the exclamation point in this post.) !!",Poésie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18623855-hungry-for-math,Hungry for Math Poems to Munch On.txt
No More Poems!: A Book in Verse That Just Gets Worse,"This book falls into the ""What were they thinking?!"" category. You can't just add a few bathroom and fart jokes to a book of poems and say it's for kids...especially when the rest of the subject matter is wildly inappropriate for children (or anyone, in some cases).I'm talking mainly about a poem called ""Brotherly Love"". It looks like most of the reviewers who had a problem with this book were just as horrified as I was. It isnotfunny to suggest myriad gruesome ways for a little girl to murder her sibling. Pushing him out the window (so he goes ""splat""), drowning him, dousing him in gasoline and setting him on fire, and tying him to railroad tracks are all mentioned. Even worse? The parent narrator isn't telling their child not to do these things because they're horrific and wrong; they're telling the child not to do these things because the parent would go to jail. That's one messed-up family right there... and if a child's family is like that, then they need immediate help. What theydon'tneed is to see their dysfunction reinforced in a children's book.Other poems like ""My Device"" sort of suggest that some of these poems weren't written for kids in the first place. (That particular poem makes mention of visiting Mom's house with a birthday cake, as if the narrator is already grown up and has moved out.) Others are definitely for kids, but they often involve peeing or farting (yes, kids think farts are funny... but they will laugh at other things, too; let's be a little more creative, shall we?). Some poems like ""Weirdos of the World Unite!"" and ""My Twin"" seem to encourage judgment and name-calling. ""How to Play Baseball"" makes light of verbal abuse. The only poem I sort of like is ""My Secret Karate"", but it's the first poem; it's all downhill from there. On the bright side, I guess this book lives up to its subtitle.I would definitely not recommend this to young children. Their thinking is still too literal to get much out of many of these poems. And I wouldn't recommend ""Brotherly Love"" to anybody. Gruesome child murder is never funny, no matter how old you are (and if you think suggesting dousing a young child in gasoline and setting them on fire is funny... well, I don't really know what to say to that).Dan Santat's talents are wasted here.

"So, You Think You Can Hip-Hop","I'm thankful that the other Goodreads reviews pointed out the body shaming in this comic so I didn't have to. It's not as often as it used to be to see a character who's only character trait is to not only revolve around nothing but her weight but to only discuss and think about food. It would be one thing if the joke was that the girls had a restrictive diet to keep being athletic and they wanted to splurge before the rehearsal, but the majority of the jokes revolve around the one girl who isn't even overweight, just has an average body type compared to the cartoonishly thin girls. It's pretty irresponsible given that the audience is young girls, but also dancers who do have to deal with body shaming in real life. It's also obvious that this was written and drawn by two men and one woman, given not only the body type of every female character but how they all have large chests. I also may just be saying this as an American reader, but some of the jokes make me question what age range this is for. Some of the jokes are explained so blatantly that it seems intended for very young children, but then they go to a party and a guy is groping a girl in the background (though maybe this could have been a background gag that they thought would go over the kid's heads). On the positive side, as someone who used to do ballet, a number of the gags were funny. While not every joke landed, the comic has the plotless feel of an Azumanga Daioh or a better full-page newspaper strip. Aside from the body shaming, the art stands out when the characters have pretty decent dancer proportions, and the backgrounds are detailed for a gag strip. But overall the comic itself is pretty average. If a kid or someone else you know is into ballet then they might enjoy this, though ""To Dance"" by Siena Cherson Siegel is way, way better and lacks the body shaming aspect. I at least wouldn’t mind picking up the next installment.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12729786-so-you-think-you-can-hip-hop,"So, You Think You Can Hip-Hop.txt"
The Magic Fish,"‘We tell ourselves stories in order to live,’ wroteJoan Didion. Stories help us contextualize the world around us and at a young age has been shown to shape our empathy and help us grow.The Magic Fishby Trung Le Nguyen is a stellar graphic novel that shows the interplay between life and literature and the ways storytelling can empower and shape us. The book follows Tiến and his family through a period of griefs and struggles centering around familial relationships. As a first generation American born to Vietnamese refugees, the language barrier between him and his parents is a daunting obstacle in his plan to come out to them as gay and meanwhile his mother is processing her grief over her aging and ill mother she hasn’t seen since she left Vietnam. To help them process the sadnesses of life, they read Vietnamese fairytales to each other, and the three retellings here probe deeper into the psychology of their lives through brilliant juxtaposition of the interwoven narratives. The beautifully intricate artwork and heartfelt storytelling sends the reader on an emotional investigation of generational traumas, alienation, and queer struggles through a stunning portrayal of an immigrant family trying their best to reach and love one another.‘Joy is a precious thing. And precious things are few. So we learn to hold on to them’This graphic novel is a real emotional deep dive that manages to remain shimmering with beauty even through the darkest moments. The fairy tales, retellings of Vietnamese versions such as Cinderella or The Little Mermaid, feel fresh and exciting but perfectly compliment the current lives of the characters. An empathetic reader often packs the stories they are currently obsessing over into their lives and personalities a bit, which is a notion I’ve often felt and truly comes alive here. Reading a book you are engrossed in becomes like a pair of colored sunglasses that temporarily tint the world with its atmosphere.The Magic Fishreminds us of that and explores the way storytelling can have a healing power and help us see more clearly when we step outside ourselves and view it as a story.Trung Le Nguyen approaches the character’s lives with the slightest of touches, entering their struggles and griefs without dwelling too much which leaves so much of the deeper understanding to grow within the readers mind like an emotional participant. There is a playfulness and soft whimsicality threaded through the book that paces out relief from the ever growing tensions. Threading is what this book does best, with each narrative drawn in one of three hues to denote if it is their life, the stories they read, or a memory. The yellow memory frames crop up to seamlessly thread timelines and, which they are sparse and only offer hints, completely expand your understanding and deliver some of the strongest emotional punches.The use of color allows multiple narratives to interact on the page in cool and dynamic ways.There is a lot going on here, with generational struggles, language barriers and a coming out that sparks the ire of a teacher. Tiến is sent to a priest and the shame of being gay is attempted to be forced upon him, but the balance between the acceptance of his friends really makes this a comforting and empowering queer narrative that doens’t shirk away from the problems of acceptance. It becomes a form of alienation from the general public--one that claims to want everyone to integrate but then pushes people away for their identities--as a parallel to the alienation his parents feel as refugees in new place with only a modest grasp on the language. This is a story that is sure to spark empathy and leave you thinking about many forms of identity, perfectly handled in a way that will resonate and stick with the YA audience it is aimed at but equally as powerful to adult readers.A truly magical and beautiful book about the power of storytelling and the struggles of living,The Magic Fishis a massive success. Also it is perfect for Pride Month, so definitely check it out!4.5/5",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42394599-the-magic-fish,The Magic Fish.txt
Mooncakes,"Witches, werewolves, demons, ghosts, a dude with a bird for a head…this book has it all for a great spooky season read.MooncakesbySuzanne Walkerand wonderfully illustrated byWendy Xu(who wrote and illustrated the very lovelyTidesong) is an adorable queer graphic novel packed full of action and emotion. When Tam, a werewolf runaway, returns to their childhood town to hunt a demon they are reunited with their former best friend, Nova, who aims to help them in their quest to discover ancient werewolf powers to defeat the demon. It is a story of experimentation, research and romance, with a large cast that examines family dynamics and trauma and while the story is a bit clunky it is so sweet and heartwarming that I couldn’t help but love it.Also there is plenty ofWitchcraft!One thing I really enjoyed aboutMooncakeswas how much it covers that will be relatable to teens living lives outside the realm of witches and werewolves. Tam is running from an abusive step-father, Nova is dealing both with the death of her parents and her parents (as ghosts) disappointed in her for not leaving town to pursue her dreams of witchcraft. Along the way we have friendly neighbors hiding ulterior motives, cults and a full on demon stalking about the town so mileage may vary if this is like your town or not. Seemed pretty believable as far as Holland, MI goes. I really enjoyed that there was non-binary representation with Tam using they/them pronouns and nobody having any issue switching to that, as well as Nova using hearing aids and finding ways to combine them with her magic to be more powerful. So that was all very cool. Speaking of which, the action scenes are pretty great and one thing Wendy Xu excels at is having frames that are stuffed full of things going on without ever feeling overcrowded or confusing.The artwork is fantastic in this and has a bit of a Studio Ghibli vibe to it with all the cottagecore scenery and outfits. It’s just all so very pretty to look at. The story itself is pretty involved with a pretty rich world and a lot of implied backstory, though sometimes it does feel less like being dropped into a larger world you can pick up through context and more like you accidentally skipped over an earlier volume or something. The characters are adorable though, if even a bit one-note, but I quite enjoyed them all interacting and supporting one another. It’s cute enough to gloss over a lot.So if you want a good queer graphic novel,Mooncakesis an adorable delight full of fun. This is perfect for the coming Halloween season, or just a cute read any time of the year.⅘",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44774415-mooncakes,Mooncakes.txt
The Legend of Bold Riley,"Individual parts of this book rate as high as five stars for me, but I've got to take it as the whole.The story:Each separate piece of the story stands well on their own. I do wish they'd been more connected. For example, once she left home, she never thinks of her parents or siblings again, nor do they make any attempt to contact her. That felt odd to me. The only attempt to tie two of the stories together is in the last two stories, but the transition is very abrupt. At the end of ""The Wicked Temple,"" Riley cheerfully leaves her god-bird friend behind and rides off to another adventure; at the beginning of ""The Golden Trumpet Tree,"" the injury she'd received is killing her and her horse is dead for an unknown reason. There's nothing at the end of ""The Wicked Temple"" that implies her situation is that dire, and what on earth happened to her poor horse? The story doesn't say!I also have to protest the ending of ""The Golden Trumpet Tree."" It's a really sweet story, but look, I'm sick and tired of tragic queer narratives. This isn't because I demand happy endings, but rather because there is a harmful trend of LGBT+ characters only being allowed to exist if something bad happens to them. Writers, stop burying your gays! I promise, nothing bad will happen if your leading lady gets to keep her girlfriend! The LGBT+ community has seen far, far too many stories that end in heartbreak. You're not being creative or original; it's just a cliche at this point! I'll continue to scream this from the heavens until the dead gay lover stops being a thing. We're a long way away from that, unfortunately, and so I continue to scream.The artwork:Most of the artwork in this book is gorgeous! I LOVED the art for ""The Serpent in the Belly"" and ""The Golden Trumpet Tree,"" especially. GORGEOUS! So vibrant and full of life!...And then there's ""The Wicked Temple,"" which, uhh?? I guess some people might like that style? I found it to be very messy, and it was difficult to see what was happening in the action scenes. It was devoid of the color that is so, well, BOLD in the rest of the stories. It's just blah. Blah Riley. No, no, go back to the strong flowing lines and the vibrant colors!In summary, there were a few disappointments and the book could have used some more cohesion, but I did enjoy reading it. I really enjoyed reading a graphic novel featuring a smart, brave woman of color!",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15759065-the-legend-of-bold-riley,The Legend of Bold Riley.txt
"Wayward, Vol. 1: String Theory","Let's just take a moment to bask at the gloryfulness that is the cover of this book.What do you imagine?I imagine a runaway, who's been hunted by shadow monsters because of a scared power she held deep within herself, most probably tied to her by a curse. Maybe she lived with the people of the night, trying to destroy that evil spirit that always possesses the neighborhood cats. I imagine a heroine that shouldn't be taken lightly, who's strong and passionate about what she does. A powerful one too, who is far off from stereotypes. A novel full of lurking ancient magic, witches, sacred spells and ancient ghosts. A twisted story that leaves you on edge and your head spinning at every turn of the page. I imagine well-developed characters with distinct backstories and fun dialogues. Just the perfect story my body was itching to read.And this is exactly why you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover.This book did nothing to capture my attention.Nothing.As soon as I got a couple pages in, I knew exactly how the book would turn out. I found myself rolling my eyes at their attempts at conversation.I found myself constantly growing bored and wanting to just stop reading this.Not a good sign, guys. The only thing that kept this book along were the random bits of action, though it failed to explain the reason behind the attacks. - Other than, of course, to allow the author introduce something new to the book.She walks into a creepy alley for some strange reason and meets some guys who*gasp*aren't exactly friendly.Hmm, Rory, I wonder why people don't walk into a dark deserted alley in a city crawling with people.You'd think the main character would have a little more common sense.Guy 1:""Don't be scared, we're nice guys.""Guy 2:""They're nice, but I'm not.""They attack her, andsurprise!stranger to the rescue! Sounds a bit familiar to you? I wonder why. Just convenient, isn't it? She walks into an alley for no actual reason at all and learns of her true powers. I was expecting a little more creativity and depth to the story instead of the characters just doing things for the sake of moving the story along.Beginning with Rory, moving to Tokyo after the divorce of her parents, shes thrust into a completely new world. There wasn't much to her character other than her bland personality and the fact that she found almosteverything""weird"". Like it amazes me how she could look at a kid feeding on spirits and find it ""weird"" or her vision goes all supernatural and she suddenly sees a freaking path to a place shes never been to and just goes, ""Oh wow, that was weird.""How?!?!Let's not even mention her simple train of thoughts. I'm not even kidding, 60% of the book is just Rory and her going:.Oh, spare me.On to her group, we have the Over-Excited Pinky Pie aka Ayane, who's unnaturally happy almost all the time (although, I must say, I kinda like her); Mr. Unnecessarily-Pissed (Shirai), angry street destroyer extraordinaire; and Boy Helpless McMerlin (Nikaido), who seriously gives me the creeps. Huh, now guess who doesn't want to be team leader. Sooriginal, am I right?Other than the really slow and painful start, it begins to pick up near the end (Part of the reason why this didn't get a 1 but a 3). As predictable as this was, I did like that mysterious vibe it gave off. I'll will continue on with this series to see if it gets any better. I recommend this to those who aren't heavy/picky readers.

Batman: Year One,"You know the classics of literature - War and Peace, Crime and Punishment, Middlemarch? There are aspects to them to appreciate and patient readers can be rewarded greatly with those books. But let's be honest - most of us view classics as a bit of a chore. But what about classic comics? Kind of the same thing, but not for so many. Some classic comics, Marvel and DC especially, are tough to read because the stories from the 40s and 50s are so badly written and cheesy, and the art is hit or miss, though most of them possess a guileless charm to them that makes them easier to stomach. When it comes to comics, no character stands taller than Batman, and no Batman book has more of a reputation than Year One. Is it a chore to read? No. Has it aged poorly? Not even a bit. Does it deserve it's title as a true bona fide classic? (Austin Powers voice) Yeah, baby!Year One is Frank Miller and David Mazzuchelli's retelling of Batman's origin and through their retelling they set the tone and standard for all other Batman books that followed. A 25 year old Bruce Wayne returns to a nightmarish Gotham City riddled with crime at the same time as an older but still young James Gordon, recently transferred to the GCPD and entering Gotham City for the first time. Both men have a clear mission: to clean up the streets of crime and make Gotham habitable for decent, hardworking folks.Some readers have wondered why Gordon gets as much space - maybe more - as Bruce Wayne in this book and the answer is simple: they're both two sides of the same coin. The very first Batman story opens with Bruce and Jim sitting, talking about crime, and Jim is arguably Batman's best friend. Batman's origin would tie in with Gordon's as their lives will be linked forever once they dig their heels in and bring justice to Gotham.It's been a few years since I read Year One and I really hoped it would hold up - and it did. Whatever your feelings are about Frank Miller today (and he has unfortunately gone from genius writer to crackpot old man), his work in the 80s ranks amongst the best the comics medium has ever produced, and Year One is arguably the pinnacle of that work. He went from telling the last Batman story ever with The Dark Knight Returns to, with his next book, going back to the very beginning and telling the first Batman story ever - and both are masterpieces.In just four issues, we see Bruce get into his first fight as an unmasked vigilante, to realising he must don a disguise, to the famous ""Yes. Father. I will become a bat"" scene, to his fledgling first missions to clear up corrupt police, mob bosses, and the iconic dinner party scene where he appears to Gotham's most powerful and evil to inform them they have eaten well but from now on none of them are safe. And the scene when Batman takes down the SWAT team? Brilliant. Still tense, exciting, and fantastic to read.It's a testament to Miller's writing that he's able to take Gordon, who for many is little more than a one-note background character, and makes you care about him as much as you do Batman. Gordon becomes Gotham's first non-corrupt officer, fighting his own colleagues (literally and figuratively) to uphold the law and become better than the criminals they chase, while his wife is pregnant with James Jr. (see Batman: The Black Mirror for what happened to James Jr. when he grew up) and the stresses of the job leading to him make some bad decisions.We also meet Selina Kyle for the first time, working as a dominatrix in Gotham's red light district, as she decides to become her own costumed character, Catwoman, after first seeing Batman. Mazzuchelli's art in this book is flawless but my one criticism of the book is Catwoman's outfit - I hate the whiskers and tail! What use are either to a cat burglar? And it just looks stupid.Anyway, Year One is a must-read for all Batman fans - as if you didn't already know! Everyone who has even a cursory knowledge of Batman comics knows Year One is one of the first to read. And it is - but it's also one to re-read and come back to again and again because there are a LOT of Batman books, but few of such high quality as Year One. A great beginning for the Dark Knight and the man who would be Commissioner. Just don't read Year Two!",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59980.Batman,Batman Year One.txt
"Ultimate Comics Spider-Man, Vol. 1","Hey, this is really good![he says 400 years after everyone else]Spider-Man, Peter Parker, is hands-down my favorite comic book character. And I add the ""Peter Parker"" there because I think the Peter Parker identity is crucial to loving Spider-Man. I do. Because Peter Parker is a broke-ass fool, perpetual underdog, and a kind of lovable spaz. There are a lot of characters where I don't think you need to give a hot damn about their alter ego, such as Batman or Deadpool. Characters who are definitely more their super personae than their civilian selves. I don't think I would notice if I read Batman comics for a couple years and he wasn't Bruce Wayne even once. Does Deadpool even OWN a pair of jeans?But Peter Parker is a regular guy. Spider-Man is the superhero. And the two are intertwined. They both build on and improve each other.What Ultimate Comics does, which I think is really cool, is to build off the ending of Ultimate Spider-Man. Miles Morales is Spider-Man, but he's not Peter Parker, and Bendis doesn't try to make him Peter Parker. Side characters in the comics actually criticize the new Spider-Man because he's clearly not Peter Parker, the Spider-Man they all love. And it's really interesting, to me, to see the story play out in the panels parallel to the way it does in real life. To see the critiques leveled on the pages that are also leveled in real life.It's cool, and it's a genuine reboot with fresh ideas as opposed to a changing of some minor details while keeping the core character exactly the same, telling the same origin story, and having a guy fight a version of the Lizard who is essentially the same but looks a little cooler.I DID read an article that had a problem with this new approach because Miles Morales is black, and so, ""of course"" his father is a reformed criminal, and his uncle is currently a criminal. The premise of the article being, from what I could tell, ""Why does black Spider-Man have to have criminal parents?""I had that critique in my head when I read the story, and I have to say that it didn't hold a lot of water by the time I finished.I'm a big fan of stories that have potential for character redemption as opposed to perfect angels remaining perfect angels. I mean, when you have a setup where it's pretty clear (this is all guesswork, BTW, not truly spoilers) that Spider-Man is going to have to end up fighting his own uncle, with whom he is close, I think what we're going to see is a situation where BOTH the hero and the villain are black, which is rare, and a situation where right and wrong are a little murky, which is also a good thing, in my opinion.A good comic book story has conflict where one character is right. A GREAT comic book story has conflict where, to some extent, you can see both sides, and I really feel like that's where we're heading, and somewhere that Spider-Man comics haven't always been able to go. A lot of my favorite Spider-Man stories present villains whose motivations are good. It's just their methods that are problematic.And the very idea of a villain being black is kind of interesting to me.We are seeing more diversity in comic book heroes, but I don't see the calls for diversity expanding to villains so much. Where's black Dr. Octopus? Does anyone want that to happen? And if not, why? I don't really see a lot of cool female villains either. I see the ranks filling with more diversity, and that's cool, but I feel like the diverse characters (Sam Wilson, Captain Marvel, Lady Thor, Ms. Marvel as superheroes, stuff like Lumberjanes and Bitch Planet on the indie side) fill very aspirational roles. Where are the villains? Where are the heroes who, though ultimately heroic, would not be any fun to hang out with and make some bad choices?Why are we getting the call for a black James Bond, but no similar requests for black Hannibal Lecter?To take a different angle, you'll notice that nearly ALL classic comic villains are white, if they have an Earth-based race. In Batman's rogues gallery, Killer Croc is probably the only well-known black character, and the question of blackness and identity in a crocodile man is one that I'm not nearly equipped to answer. For Spider-Man, Prowler and Cardiac are probable the most famous black villains, and how many out there know anything about Cardiac?If you compare the list of black hereos(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of...)to black villains (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of...)you can see that there's a HUGE difference.The movies showcase a bit more diversity in heroes than the comics, but I can still only really remember 3 black villains. Michael Clarke Duncan as Kingpin, Michael Clarke Duncan as Manute in Sin City, and Jamie Foxx as Electro in Amazing Spider-Man 2. I guess the unfortunate death of Michael Clarke Duncan has slowed the casting of black villains...This is all a really long way of saying that character diversity, to me (so take this for what it's worth), means black superheroes, and it also means black villains. It means Asian main characters, and it also means Asian side characters who don't amount to much. It means strong, powerful women, and it means women who represent our fears as opposed to hopes and dreams. It means white men who are bad guys, heroes, and nobodies.I recognize that non-aspirational characters are something I read for that not all people enjoy, but I really like characters who aren't 100% aspirational or who have done something genuinely wrong. Characters who make choices that are different from my own, or that I'd at least like to think are different from my own. Because that's how I feel life is. I have friends who have lives that are distinctly different from my own, and they make choices that I would never make, good and bad, and we're still friends. I still like them. And something I have to wrestle with sometimes is the fact that there are people I don't like who do genuinely good things. And I just plain don't like them, and when they do something good, it makes me like them EVEN LESS because I'm confronted with the fact that this person I dislike is probably not so bad. That's the worst. When some jerk does something great, that's the WORST.Peter Parker's life course was set by the death of his uncle. Miles Morales' life course will also be strongly influenced by his uncle. Peter Parker's uncle was killed in Amazing Fantasy 15, the first appearance of Spider-Man, and it was really his legacy we had to live on. Miles Morales' uncle is alive, and that means he can make choices, do things, and be an active character in the story who makes decisions.Ultimate Spider-Man is an all-time favorite of mine, and so far it seems like Bendis is bringing a lot of the same energy to Ultimate Comics Spider-Man. I feel like this series is gonna be a winner.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60418159-ultimate-comics-spider-man-vol-1,"Ultimate Comics Spider-Man, Vol. 1.txt"

The Wicked + The Divine #17,"So, this issue was probably the one I was most dubious about when I heard of the guest artist line up and that is because whilst I do really like some of Brandon Graham's work, I definitely didn't think it would work particularly well with this storyline. I still stand by this initial assessment after having read it and I didn't really 'care' about the art, in fact at times I felt it just detracted from a storyline which was actually very good once again. The big problem I have with guest artists is that they add a lot of confusion into the mix and a story which would have flowed well from one part to the next in a volume has been somewhat muddled with the art style ever-changing.With all of that said I have enjoyed hearing the backstories for some of our characters in the last few issues and the story of Sakhmet was highly interesting still. I do think that the writing of this one remained constant and good, but I will be very, very happy when the series relaunches in April with the original team back at the centre of everything :)On the whole, a decent issue but certainly not a standout one. 3*s",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27278979-the-wicked-the-divine-17,The Wicked + The Divine #17.txt
The Wicked + The Divine #20,"AAAAAAAMAZINGI'm truly impressed and fully satisfied with how the fourth arc is developing so far: many questions left open are getting complete answers and exhaustive explanations.In this issue we have the chance to reliveLaura'-EXCUSE ME, Persephone's supposed death through Inanna's and Baphomet's eyes(their comments resemble an awful lot my fangirling btw).The flashback is depicted with fresh new colour tones and distinctive designs that perfectly represent the underground. My heart aches at realising how much I actually missed McKelvie's incredible artwork.The multitude of beautifully planned pages (the usual black chapter-starter missing the gods' symbols? wow; the fire eating up ananke's page? HOLY FUDGE) makes me want to buy this issue and hang it up on my wall, right next to #5.We also get a little more insight into Baphomet's (NEGRAL??!?) character who keeps getting more interesting and complex. I have to admit I still don't get Urdr's usefulness or whole character but I don't mind that mystery staying the way it is.just wow, i'm expecting the major battle in the next issue,p.s. anyone else obsessed with the awesome covers?",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29638983-the-wicked-the-divine-20,The Wicked + The Divine #20.txt
The Wicked + The Divine #19,"I think everyone will like this arc the best just because it's all action and high stakes (I could feel myself screaming in my head as both sides fought to get Minerva) ---- and even then Gillen still allows the characters to breathe a little. The pantheon is now all out civil war with the Gods divided among the sky gods and the underworld gods. Needless to say, Dionysus, who has always seen Woden for who he truly is, is roped in with the underworld gods. It's a shame that the gods we know and love like Baal and Amaterasu are still Ananke's pawns but I am really loving the underworld gods banding together.Now the worry is if the underworld gods will end up fracturing after the revelation from #18's epilogue...",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29278538-the-wicked-the-divine-19,The Wicked + The Divine #19.txt
The Wicked + The Divine #18,"The Wicked + The Divine is BACK to its former glory. I loved everything about this issue: the action-packed plot, finally seeing Persephone in action - as expected, she's badass -, the tone it's setting for this arc, the developments it's foreshadowing, the pomegranates (!!!!!!), the gorgeous art we've come to miss during the Commercial suicide arc, this ending (talk about a cliffhanger), errrr'thang I'm telling you.I might be biased though because Persephone/Proserpina has always been my favorite divine figure, all myths considered.I can't wait to see which direction they will take with that Destroyer persona, and what exactly it entails.On a totally different note, Minerva's parents physically make me sick.Also, even if I enjoyed that plot ""twist"", I'm kinda mad that Baphomet cheated on Morri. I mean, he's already a murderous asshole, does he really need to cheat on the only great thing in his life to top it all off?Moreover, Ananke knowing about this one night stand strikes me as odd. Considering they can't reach the underworld Gods when they're underground, it's quaint & convoluted that she'd know of something that presumably happened underground.I'm very intrigued by that machine Ananke has Woden build, and what its purpose is.My baby Ananke is as cryptic & dodgy as ever, I'm love it.But as the plot moves further, there's almost a shift in paradigm and I'm wondering if Ananke's the evil character that she's been portrayed as in Commercial suicide.I guess we'll have to wait & see.

The Wicked + The Divine #12,"So I was ridiculously excited to see what was going to happen in this issue. After reading and ADORING Volume 1 and 2 (and THAT ENDING?!) I needed to know what was going to happen next and whilst this issue did give us a little insight, it ultimately wasn't quite what I was hoping for and the level of detail and excitement really wasn't there.For the next few issues the team have decided that they want to include a couple of new Guest Artists. I don't mind this of course because I fully support promoting new and upcoming artists who deserve a shot, however the problem comes when the series up until now has had SUCH a distinctive and beautiful style and that's been a MAJOR part of creating not only the story but the characters and expressions etc.I liked the art style which Brown employed, liked. I didn't really like or love the art style, it was just decent. I thought that the colouring and lettering were still very good and the story, whilst nothing revolutionary, was engaging. I didn't feel as though I could connect with or identify the characters quite as well or easily in this issue which meant that whilst, if this had been a Cowes-illustrated book it still may have only got a 4*s overall, I just cannot give this more than a 3.5*s which is so sad after just HOW MUCH I adored the ending of issue 11.Overall I'd say that the artist has clearly got talent and her own style which is nice, but it's not the same and it doesn't work nearly as well for me in this context. I hope that the future few artists do a little better or hook me into the story a bit more as I don't want to have a disappointing Volume overall with all the Guest Artists, but I have to say I am looking forward to issue 14 which is apparently hinted to be rather revolutionary somehow and not have a guest artist?

The Wicked + The Divine #10,"Since I started reading this series in December, I've been wanting to write a review of it. I've read all the issues, I've ordered both volume compilations, and I follow the blogs. So I figured it was about time to write a review.The short is this: The Wicked + The Divine is the single greatest comic book series I have ever read and each issue just further proves that point for me.Not enough? Well alright then.The Wicked and the Divine has taken my favourite things in life: modern magic, reincarnation, ambiguous but awesome backstory, and queer as all get out peeps, and turned it into one of the most beautifully made comic books I have ever seen. The art is amazing. You know that thing where the cover art is WAY better than the inside art? Yeah that doesn't hold here. The inside art is JUST AS GOOD just SLIGHTLY less detailed. Sometimes not even enough to notice.Laura, our main character, is totally relate-able, absolutely amazing, and gets to chill with so many gods it makes me jealous.The gods the writers picked are perfect. The way the story is being told is perfect. The concept of using pop icons as the gods and then spinning them in such a way to have deeply flawed characters without lawsuits? Brilliant.I love it. I love every single part of it. I will recommend it to anyone who listens to me long enough for me to say ""Wicked/Divine. Read it. Now."" and shove the first issue at them.My only qualm?

The Wicked + The Divine #13,"I'm giving this issue a 4.5*s which is a big relief after not really caring for the artwork in the previous issue. The artwork of this one is done by Lotay and she's a fantastic artist. Her style is more rough around the edges than that of Cowes or Brown, but I certainly prefer it to Brown's art style and it's a good back-up for Cowes.The story of this issue was also really good. I liked that we were introduced to a new member of the Gods and her storyline was dark and gritty and heart-wrenching. I felt as though it was not only a sad story, but that the way it played out and unfolded really worked and the balance was pretty spot on with the writing and pacing. Whereas the previous issue had only been a 'filler' one, this one stood out as a great issue in and of itself.The artwork for this issue is very whimsical and beautiful and much softer than the hard lines which Cowes uses and I think that did lose a little of the impact at some small moments but that's a very minor quibble. On the whole I thought Lotay to be a fantastic illustrator who knew how to get the balance right between her own style and also making each character distinctive and recognisable for the reader. I will certainly be checking out some of Lotay's other work soon because this issue made me really want to see more of her :)I would give this a 4.5*s and say it's nearly back to top form. I once again loved the last page of the issue done by Cowes and thought it was awesome.

Everything that is spoiler will be hidden.So, After that banger of ending in the last IssueThings slowed down a little. It's been a while and Laura is traumatized and kind of just going through the motions but then we finally met ""INANNA"" who is really giving me Prince Purple vibesand then some information is imparted that is bound to stir things up a bit and I'm looking forward to that!Overall I liked this Issue. Images as always are on point. Just waiting for the story to pick up a little but its seems to be chugging along.One Questions that we didn't get answered yet although it was touched upon and explored a little is... Does Laura have powers? I mean ""ANANKE"" usually visits them before hand and explains everything if their ""GODS""and shes already met Laura but could Luci have have passed along some of her power?My thoughts on Issues #1-4:The Wicked & The Divine #1:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...The Wicked & The Divine #2:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...The Wicked & The Divine #3:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...The Wicked & The Divine #4:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23440946-the-wicked-the-divine-6,The Wicked + The Divine #6.txt
The Wicked + The Divine #4,"Ultimate fangirl Laura and her “journalist” friend Cassandra’s search for the killer of a judge leads them to Baal, a Kanye West clone, who swears he didn’t do it. Speaking for the group of gods, Ananke refuses to help Luci out of prison and that’s when Luci decides not to take this crap anymore - she’s gonna bust out with or without their approval. But don’t play with me ‘cos you’re playing with fire…The issue as a whole is very fun but the best part was easily Kieron Gillen’s Baal, whom he clearly enjoyed writing as this super-arrogant rapper. It’s hard not to like that ridiculously high overconfidence and it’s easy to see why teenager Laura would crush hard on him.It’s good to catch up with the other gods who’ve been relatively quiet up til now, though I’m not sure why they were all sat in a Tron-themed room - I guess, just because? Baal has the cash and maybe he just liked Tron and thought, why not? Also, I don’t know why the other gods get to be young while Ananke remains perpetually an old woman. Maybe because she’s the boss god or the oldest god of them all? Maybe its her choice and she can’t do with sexy looks from others?I love that Gillen picked out Play With Fire by The Rolling Stones as the song of the issue - haven’t listened to that since after I watched The Darjeeling Limited several years ago, and it’s still this uber-awesome, goosepimples-on-the-skin song. That it’s Luci’s breaking out of prison tune is perfect too, it’s so charged and menacing but lo-fi and not loud because it doesn’t need to be.This is another incredible looking issue with Jamie McKelvie’s art and Matthew Wilson’s colours seeming god-like on the page. That look on Luci’s face when she lights up her first smoke in ages and plugs in the Stones - that was quite something. Every panel looks wonderful and Wilson’s colours for the Tron room are unbelievably good. The Wicked + The Divine is seriously one of the best looking comics on the market right now.Things look like they’re headed to a pleasingly destructive finale in the next and last issue of this arc thanks to the way Gillen swirls together the threads so elegantly in this issue. The Wicked + The Divine #4 is a terrific comic with solid work from everyone involved - definitely the best comic of the week!",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22753504-the-wicked-the-divine-4,The Wicked + The Divine #4.txt
The Wicked + The Divine #2,"In The Wicked + The Divine, Kieron Gillen gives new meaning to the term “rock gods”!Every 90 years twelve gods return to Earth as young people for 2 years and then die. This time around, they’re all music stars - rockers, rappers, popstars - and someone is out to kill them. Luci (short for Lucifer) foils the assassination attempt against her and her pals in the first issue but she was arrested. In the dock, it looks like she kills the judge by snapping her fingers - but she claims it wasn’t her.In this second issue, Laura, a huge fangirl and our heroine, must help bring the other gods to Luci and get her out. With the help of the cynical journo from the first issue, she gets enough information to track down someone called The Morrigan who’s performing at an abandoned underground station at night.I’m loving this series! It’s not the most action-packed title but there’s lots of great characters and wonderful interactions between them, which is what I prefer anyway. Luci’s still delightful - I’m getting a strong Loki vibe from her - and her origin story is made epic by Jamie McKelvie. Look for that awesome double splash page of her fall from ordinary girl to Luci drawn biblically epic as she literally goes through a baptism of fire!And that’s what makes this series stand out so much - Gillen’s script is great, his dialogue is acerbic, crackling, and witty as ever, but McKelvie’s interpretation of it on the page really elevates it from good to incredible. He makes perfect use of light and dark so that the subway sequence is perfectly balanced. First a wide panel to establish the scene, then pitch darkness with captions, then slowly more light so you can make out the escalator down, then the platform below, then the tunnel where the issue ends. He uses space so beautifully in his layouts that even the absence of his art makes the comic look more stylish than ever! And the series covers are so gorgeous - they better be made into posters because I want every single one to hang on my walls!I mentioned in my review of the first issue that Gillen reminded me of an amazing forgotten song - I Saw Her Standing There by The Beatles - and he does it again with #2. Celebrity Skin by Hole, a song I haven’t listened to in ages, suddenly becomes the soundtrack to this issue and it couldn’t be more suited.The first issue was a great start, but this second issue is even better - Gillen and McKelvie are both on top form and it’s utterly magical to read. The Wicked + The Divine, guys - this is the best new Image series being published right now, and I can’t say enough good things about it.

The Wicked + The Divine #3,"Get the issue with the green cover of The Morrigan staring at you. It’s a great cover in itself (holy crap, the covers for this series have been stunning!) but wait ‘til you see the transformation when you turn the page - I won’t spoil the surprise but it’s like a dark flipbook!So, The Wicked + The Divine follows a dozen gods who get reincarnated every ninety years, live for two years, and then die. This time around they’ve been reincarnated as rock/pop/hip hop/dance stars. But one of them is dead and Lucifer has been framed. It’s up to Laura, her biggest fangirl, to help her find the killer.In this issue Laura’s search has taken her to an abandoned underground station where she was expecting to see someone called The Morrigan but things have gone tits up and a fire god called Baphomet is waiting instead. Another god called Badb shows up and the two battle before the riot squad appear and everything goes black…This is the first issue in The Wicked + The Divine that I haven’t totally loved. The idea of two gods battling underground seems cooler than the way Kieron Gillen’s written it here. In this issue, it comes off as a bit dull with no stakes really established and no clear idea of why they’re fighting. Badb’s got an interesting way of speaking though - kind of like she’s beatboxing the whole time. After the action’s over, Luci and Cass talk through the list of suspects in a really mundane fashion and then the issue’s over.Jamie McKelvie’s art and Matthew Wilson’s colours are still totally incredible. McKelvie seems like he’s really enjoying playing with the comic, using negative space effectively, mixing up the panel sizes imaginatively - wide panels for cinematic action scenes, regular 6-8 panel grids for talky scenes - and throwing in splash pages to plateau the pacing.Gillen’s writing is usually more engaging than it is here which, combined with McKelvie/Wilson’s work, has made this series one hell of a follow-up to Young Avengers. #3 though is a bit of a yawner and I found myself losing interest at not even the halfway point.Also, I’ve gotten a song I’d forgotten out of each issue so far (#1 = The Beatles’ I Saw Her Standing There, #2 = Hole’s Celebrity Skin) and with #3 I got nothing. Maybe Eminem’s Lose Yourself at a stretch but no real strong song impression for this comic, which is disappointing.I’m still definitely in for this series but The Wicked + The Divine #3 is a dip in quality compared to the previous two issues’ brilliance.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22733332-the-wicked-the-divine-3,The Wicked + The Divine #3.txt

Klaus #1,"I'm a sucker for adaptations of old fairy tales and myths (Grimm, Fable, etc.) So when I heard that Grant Morrison is coming out with a Santa origin story, I just know that I had to find a way to get my hands on it and read it.The story starts with Mr Klaus (he doesn't know that he's Santa yet) visiting a small village in the middle of winter to sell his wolfskin, but he ran into trouble after learning that the Yuletime holiday had just been banned, and adults are sent to work in the mines. What's more, toys are taken away from the children because fun is also restricted.In the first issue, we don't really see a lot of signs of the Santa we know yet, as it focused more on laying the groundwork of the plot. Which I think was good, because it teases you of what's in store in the next issues.What we did get to see was possibly the manifestation of Christmas spirits and the role that they play. I really hope that the next issues will show and describe what was actually going on.Talking about the spirits, I can't forget to mention how great the art was. It was amazing, and really did a good job in making the stories come alive. Just in the first issue alone, there were a lot of amazingly drawn pages.Overall, the first issue was a great start to the origin of Santa. I was really impressed with both the story and artwork, will definitely follow this series closely.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29980957-klaus-1,Klaus #1.txt
Phonogram: The Immaterial Girl #4,"Gillen and McKelvie’s stylish cover of Scott Pilgrim. And the reason they can get away with a cover which, for large chunks, appears totally irrelevant to the story they’ve been telling so far, is that they understand why the original works and don’t just slavishly replicate it but cover it in their own style. It’s still about constructing your identity round bands and thematically ties in to the main Emily story, but it’s from the perspective of characters from The Singles Club arc instead. Your enjoyment for it may depend on your tolerance of conceptual hi-jinks; but if you’ve made it this far into the series it’s likely to be high enough to go with the flow. You know what you’re getting from the series by this point.Oh, and as Gillen says in the notes, Laura is deeply, tragically wrong about Couples. But wrong in exactly the way people were at the time.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28356086-phonogram,Phonogram The Immaterial Girl #4.txt
Phonogram: The Immaterial Girl #3,"Music isn’t just important to the characters in Phonogram, it’s who they are. Identity, desires, needs all expressed through bands and songs. This issue goes even further into the conflict between the Pop Kid and the Girl Who’s Just Too Damn Cool For You that are Emily and Clare, the two halves of the central character. Changing taste in music becomes a method of diving into your own past, taking us back to the girl both Emily and Clare once were. You might have had to have given your heart and soul to a band or artist to fully understand what Gillen and McKelvie are doing with both words and artwork but if you do this comic could be your life; uncomfortable in how well it understands you but uplifted that people do understand you and that they get to write a comic like this for you.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27218948-phonogram,Phonogram The Immaterial Girl #3.txt
Phonogram: The Immaterial Girl #2,"I never dreamt that I would get to be/ The creature that I always meant to be’ as a wise man once sang and Emily Aster probably should have listened more closely. Even though she’d probably have simply sneered at the very thought. I was a pop kid when I started out loving music; if you’re discovering music for yourself you almost certainly have the same experience. The bright hooks, beautiful people and imagery draw you in. I had every Madonna album, my first record was Ghostbusters. And then I started listening to white guys with guitars and, in the search for an adult identity, disowned the pop past, constructing myself around bands offering less simple sentiments and less immediate pleasures. And, as the issue unfolds, you can see that this is exactly what this issue’s about.Emily’s deal with the devil involved swapping her pop past for cool points and, like me when I got past my Indie Kid stage, it comes back to bite you on the backside when you realise the pleasures of simple pop records. For me the choice was easy; I happily adapted in the face of overwhelming evidence that sometimes three minutes of disposable wonder is enough. I suspect the question here will be whether Emily can do the same. And given it’s all wrapped in McKelvie’s usual superb art and Matt Wilson’s vivid colours with a bonus of some seriously fine recreations of iconic 80s pop videos this is an irresistible ride.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26995964-phonogram,Phonogram The Immaterial Girl #2.txt
Phonogram: The Immaterial Girl #1,"This book dives right in. We meet our main character Claire, now Emily, who as a young girl is captivated by music videos. Her devotion to them is so deep that eventually, a being from beyond the screen reaches out to her with an offer. She will gain magic and success if she gives up half of herself to live behind the screen.Cut to the present day and she is a music critic and lover who is meeting with others who have also made the deal.She is starting to question the deal she made when her other self reaches through a screen and switches their places. The her that was stuck in TV world is not let loose and the her from our world is now trapped behind the screen.She quickly discovers that she is stuck in A-Ha's Take on Me music video and the guy with the wrench has just showed up.This is a cool little story that has me intrigued after one issue. The art is good throughout and there are some panels that really stand out. I like that it was able to use different art styles as well, while still feeling cohesive.While writing this, I also started seeing this as being commentary on fame and what you have to do to get famous and stay that way.At the end we also get two mini comics.The first is about a man who is able to see the ghost of a lost love when he plays Taylor Swift's ""I Wish You Would."" He plays it over and over again to wallow in the pain.The second is about a a guy at a concert, thinking critically about the band as the girl next to him is giddy and showing it. So, he spills his drink on her, ""on accident.""Overall, an interesting book that I am interested to see where it will go in the 2nd issue.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26995791-phonogram,Phonogram The Immaterial Girl #1.txt
The Joker: Death of the Family,"Like any avid Batman fan, finding out that the Joker will be returning in the New 52 line-up was instantly gratifying, especially since I consider him my most favorite Batman villain ever since Mark Hamill's version inBatman: The Animated Series. But DC did not make having the Joker back a walk-in-the-park either. He is, after all, Batman's ultimate nemesis so you bet your ass they're gonna make a big crossover event about it. And that is exactly what is collected in this deluxe edition. From a more objective perspective, putting every Joker appearance since his grand return in one impressive volume is practical if you're the kind of fan who wants to keep track of everything. But in a more critical point of view,The Joker: Death of the Familyis a problematic anthology only because some stand-alone stories do not connect with each other and there are quite a few that were better off not read if what you aim for is Joker's direct connection with Batman and the rest of the Robins (plus Batgirl).To further illustrate my point, I will give a short description of each story included and whether or not you need to check them out in order to fully digest and appreciate Scott Synder'sDeath of the Family. What you should keep in mind is there is a separate collected edition that only included Scott Snyder's version of events and if you already have that but you feel like you also wanted to check out what the other writers have done in their crossover stories, I sure hope that my insights will help you discern for yourself if you still need to buy this particular edition. Don't worry about any major spoilers ahead.DETECTIVE COMICS #16-17Batman investigates a series of Joker-themed menace committed by mentally disturbed people who identify strongly with the clown prince of crime. Written by John Layman, this is a very engrossing story that one could view as the ripple effect of Joker's return to Gotham's outcasts. It examines the magnetism of the Joker as an elusive figure and why dangerous men like him appeals to a certain kind of lost individuals such as the ones featured here. If you follow the Detective Comics yourself, you will recognize that this is a continuation of the Emperor Penguin plot but readers who will just pick up this issue do not need to concern themselves with that because #16-#17 focuses entirely on the Joker groupies who call themselves The League of Smiles and what havoc they inspire.RECOMMENDED: YES, only because it's a well-written exploration about the kind of madness that the Joker inflicts on frail-minded and anti-social people. The artwork by Jason Fabok and Andy Clarke is a tantalizing feat as well.CATWOMAN #13-14This is one of the stories that really do not add anything to Snyder'sDeath of the Family. The Joker trying to entice Catwoman to join whatever sick game he is about to perpetrate is not that much of a worthwhile read because I could never understand why he jilted Catwoman around in the first place. Aside from the occasional laughs I got from the Joker's sly if not heavy-handed gags to lure or belittle Catwoman, there really isn't anything to this story that has any effect on what is about to take place once the Joker confronts the Bat family.RECOMMENDED: NOSUICIDE SQUAD #14-15The Joker visits Harley Quinn during a funeral and proceeds to torment her with a viciousness and cruelty that we haven't seen him do before. As a shipper and supporter of this duo, it was an unsettling situation to read and yet I still thought that this story presented the most daring if not erotic interactions between the Joker and his favorite pet/toy. I'm one of those fans who always considered Harley Quinn as the best companion to the Joker because she always understood perfectly what she was getting into whenever she commits heinous crimes for her Mr. J. She may be submissive to him but it's by choice and her own brand of insanity is the reason why the Joker wants her around and secretly needs her in his life. She's the captive audience, the willing participant and the ultimate groupie that someone with Joker's vanity and level of theatrics requires. In these issues, Harley Quinn tries to resist the Joker, recognizing that he is not the same man she gave up her sanity for in the first place. What follows is an intense read of why comics' arguably most dysfunctional relationship actually works.RECOMMENDED: IT DEPENDS. If you're a shipper like I am, this is something you should check out. If not, it's really okay to skip this one.BATGIRL #14-16This is definitely my absolute favorite tie-in among all of the Joker crossover stories. It was just stunning and breathtaking in all the right places. The narrative is crisp with haunting monologues from Barbara Gordon especially her grim contemplation to kill the Joker herself (given the intimate level of destruction he inflicted upon her inThe Killing Joke). The action sequences are amazing to peruse through. The Joker's baffling actions toward Batgirl were cringe-worthy with the misplaced sort of affection that made me sick to my own stomach. I have never realized how much their dynamics could work so compellingly until I read these issues.RECOMMENDED: YES. This is a crossover story that works really well. Gail Simone's Barbara/Batgirl is incredibly sympathetic and quite menacing herself. You really root for her to succeed and drive a blade into the Joker's heart after the hell she's been through because of him.RED HOOD #15-16; TEEN TITANS #15-16In this collection, Red Robin and Red Hood stories were crammed together as one tedious and often derivative storyline. The Joker abducts the former Robins and their own respective teams try to save them. This is the most disengaging story of all especially if you don't follow Teen Titans or The Outlaws. Their appearances would confuse new readers and have also diluted the plot, to be honest. The only redemptive quality of these issues is the confrontation faced by Tim Drake and Jason Todd who really do have unresolved issues with their surrogate father, Bruce Wayne/Batman. The Joker tries to get them to turn against each other through bringing out those issues to light. If only we focused more on that and lessened the Teen Titans/Outlaws scenes then this crossover story could have been more enjoyable.RECOMMENDED: NONIGHTWING #15-16My second favorite tie-in next to Batgirl, the original Robin Dick Grayson in this story is taken for a twisted surprise when the Joker threatens to kill everyone he upholds and obliterate the place he once called home before he was whisked away by Batman long ago when his own parents were murdered. This was emotionally engaging especially if you're someone like me who had always loved Dick Grayson as the first Robin and followed his evolution to his own choice of hero, and separation from Batman's overbearing shadow. The Joker knew what buttons to push but Dick never truly gives in to the darkness and that says a lot about him and his devotion to the other Robins including Batman himself. Dick Grayson's resilence shines through in these issues even if he ultimately recognizes how messed up his entire childhood had been as the Boy Wonder.RECOMMENDED: YESBATMAN AND ROBIN #15-16Damian Wayne, the current Robin and also Bruce Wayne's illegitimate son, is the focus of these issues. Unlike the other Robins who have their own personal encounters with the Joker before, Damian was able to challenge the Joker and call out his bluffs because he has no reason to fear him--at least not yet. Watching the Joker psychologically torture another Robin is really sickening and yet a pleasurable read to see unfold nevertheless. The highlight of this story is Damian's relationship with Batman which is rife with more complexities because the man underneath the cowl is also his own flesh and blood. Young as he is, Damian is also an intelligent Robin who is able to think quickly on his feet. His complete trust over Batman is the reason why the Joker is never truly able to break his will down.RECOMMENDED: YESBATMAN #17Ah, the very bone and marrow of theDeath of the Familyitself. This was marketed as the most exciting and best Joker story yet which actually hurts its chances to survive and be appreciated as its own story, really. The hype built around it will mislead readers who tend to have overblown expectations. So I suggest you adjust your expectations and don't expect this to be an instant classic or whatever it is being marketed as. It's not. But it's still a very enjoyable read.The entire point of the Joker's massively tormented (and, may I add, drawn out) return is to destroy the family that has made Batman weak because they humanized him. The Joker strongly believes that such relationships had reduced Batman into an ordinary and fallible man, and since the Joker's vanity is centered around the fact that he is unique and his nemesis is exactly as that too; and they are locked into an eternal battle of will and wits forever and ever (it's worth noting that there are lots of accidental homoerotic layers to the way the Joker pines over the Batman in Snyder's narrative framework), he thinks he's actually doing Batman a favor by eliminating his surrogate children and own son and heir. It makes perfect sense for the Joker to be this possessive and entitled to Batman. There's something vaguely pitiful about it too.The seventeenth issue,Death of the Familywas personally satisfying if you focus on the echoing thematic dissonance between the Batman and the Joker as the dichotomy that they've always been: order and chaos; and placing that in a more humanistic context where they are more than just mere concepts but also people who are afraid to own up and face the flaws of their humanity and how much they have alienated and often damaged the few people who are important to them. There is that poignant scene where Batman threatens to reveal to the Joker his real identity and the Joker actually flats-out refuses. That for me was a significant look at how the Joker wants to operate; he desperately wants to cut himself off from any kind of humanity including his own, but there is loneliness to that so it would be comforting for him to know that Batman will do the same as well, considering the only lasting and meaningful connection he ever had was with the Dark Knight.If you don't believe the hype created around this story and the entire crossover event thenThe Joker: Death of the Familywill be an impressive accomplishment that is worth the purchase. The writers have tried their best to add some new dimension to the Joker, particularly Snyder who I believe wanted to reveal just how much Batman and the Joker are intrinsically tied to one another. This for me is also a major milestone among Batman and his children and I'm interested to see how it plays out for everyone concerned since they basically just endured another traumatic event that should re-define their relationships.RECOMMENDED OVERALL: 8/10* If you don't have the same emotional investment on Batman, then these stories may receive lower ratings, but if you are just as addicted to the Dark Knight and his mythology as I am, then this is something that will move you deeply.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17671914-the-joker,The Joker Death of the Family.txt

Clone Volume 1,"Honestly, I feel like this is a pretty standard story. I believe this is Schulner's first foray into the comics field and I know it has some fans, though not the following that lots of other Image books have - and it sort of reads like one.Let me be more specific: Schulner is a television writer, writing shows that I've never heard of, despite being on networks. Clone was a book that I had only seen images of and mainly bought out of curiosity and actually probably as a mistake over on DCBS. I like to try the new Image books as often as possible and the price point with the discount probably put this around $6.00 for me, so whatever - that's almost a dollar an issue.And for me, that's about what it is worth, which is harsh, sure, but mostly true.A kid was cloned, all the clones find each other, all the clones are disappearing (murdered), blah blah. Even if I haven't seen or read this type of story a hundred times (I've at least read it once or twice), this is basically clone-esque science fiction written with your eyes closed and brain off. The political intrigue is really simple, the ""family"" drama is really simple, and really I just barely enjoyed any of this - though I suppose the last page of the trade has me wanting to figure out what happens, out of again, curiosity - but I won't check it out, most likely. It's not BAD. It's written like a sub-par television show (and honestly would probably make for a decent SyFy original movie), but it doesn't really use the comic book medium to it's advantage, it never really stretches out and does things you couldn't do on tv. That's why comics are awesome.On the art front, Ryp has this tendency (and I've seen it in other books he's worked on), to alternate between really awesome and really awful. As people have said, he uses a lot of lines, he makes certain aspects look real - he makes everyone look kind of dumpy (or incredibly fit). Someone compared him to Geof Darrow, which isn't far off as far as a beacon - but really far off as far as quality. Whereas Darrow has all this imaginative juice just pouring out of him, creating hyper-detailed yet out-of-this-world stuff, Ryp really keeps it grounded. I think his character designs fit in with like late 90s Tekken designs or something, and his action sequences (BIG PUNCH) are usually pretty stale. Oh and the colorist (assuming it's the colorist) has a tendency to color gunshots yellow, which made me wonder in the first issue if they were like smoke bombs or something similar.All that said, Ryp is serviceable, and could actually produce some cool work for a neo-noir, hyper-violent crime comic, I suppose - but I would love to see him work on something SUPER far out and (again) STRETCH his abilities.If you like soft sci-fi, you could give this book a shot, but with all the great Image books in the last few years, it's mostly forgettable.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16231101-clone-volume-1,Clone Volume 1.txt

This issue almost redeemsCommercial Suicidefrom what seemed like a complete fail.Yes it's still a filler but this backstory is engaging and not confusing, unlike the others.5 issues in I finally completely understand the whole guest artist idea because here it 100% works. As already explained the plan of having various illustrators work on this volume was to better portray the single gods portrayed in each issue but in #16 this fully works. Unlike all the others which I didn't like (#15 was ok but not this good) Del Duca's work clicks right when the flashback into the Morrigan's past starts, just like it's supposed to be.

The Wicked + The Divine #15,"This was the first guest issue I felt was enhanced by McKelvie’s absence; Stephanie Hans’s style feels reflective of Ameratsu being the lead character in the issue; flowing and natural rather than crisp and dynamic. It’s a continuation getting at the humans at the heart of the gods that’s permeated this arc; Gillen’s replaced a direct human conduit by stripping away the mystique to expose the people behind the mask. Throughout the arc the question has been how human beings (and young human beings at that) handle the power and responsibility of their sudden apotheosis. And for the most part he answer has come back: not very well. We’ve seen misogyny, abuses of power and suicide as a result but this issue’s like the last line on Radiohead’s The Bends; after several symphonies of despair it’s a fragile note of hope. Ameratsu is not a forceful personality, nor interested in being involved with whatever game Ananke is playing but she tries to make the world a better place in her own way. The effect of fame can be beneficial. It’s a lovely small story which is liable to get lost in the stampede to find out what’s really going on.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25970230-the-wicked-the-divine-15,The Wicked + The Divine #15.txt
The Wicked + The Divine #14,"Behind the music, Woden's stayed back from the spotlight. But in this issue? We look beneath the mask. Shall we say it's the most audacious and experimental issue of WicDiv yet? I think so.The Story: Every ninety years twelve gods return as young people. They are loved. They are hated. In two years, they are all dead. It's happening now. It's happening again.Previously: Lucifer was killed when escaping prison (for a murder she may or may not have committed). Fan girl Laura and god Inanna investigated a possible conspiracy, but where murdered by Ananke and Baphomet respectively. Inanna's ex-lover Baal managers to capture Baphomet's lover, The Morrigan. Tara commits suicide - only for Ananke to destroy the suicide note and frame Baphomet. Life goes on.The Best:Answers: Ananke. I started not liking this woman after Laura. I don't know that I ever really liked her. I mean she is after all the one who kills Lucifer. But I really had no idea that she was the one that was behind everything until Laura.Flashback: I love how this whole issue is a flashback and explanation of everything that has been going on so far. I love how several scenes show the fight with Baal and Lucifer and instead of the actual text said, it's what the implied meaning behind their words were.Cliffhanger endings: This whole series is fantastic with its cliffhanger endings and this issue is no exception. Again we are introduced to another person and another mystery.The Worst:Coloring and Artwork: I put these two together for several reasons. First let me state that I was not happy when I heard that they would be changing up the artist and colorist. To many times this has turned characters into something far from what they truly are. Things that define the characters we have connected with and define who they are get changed and that does effect the story in small ways. I hadn't really had to many complaints until now. I love the series and I still like this issue. I understand that the reason behind the art and coloring style is to show this is Wooden's story but I walked away from the issue wondering if I had a misprinted issue. It was a cool effect but it was completely distracting. Perhaps if we had a bit of knowledge about how Wooden saw things it would have changed my opinion of this issue.Recommend: To anyone who is a fan of Gods and Angels, folklore, mythology, and pop culture. Especially if your a fan girl or fan boy of anything music you will understand the hype and social media input throughout this whole series. This series isn't just about the twelve or thirteen gods that come back but it tells about the ages with which they come back in as well. Now that we are at a technology based age things are so much more instantly spread across the world. The impact is instant and felt by all.originally posted athttp://foxsdenofreviews.blogspot.com",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25970223-the-wicked-the-divine-14,The Wicked + The Divine #14.txt
"The Wicked + The Divine, Vol. 3: Commercial Suicide","Reading all three trade volumes ofThe Wicked & the Divineover two days has been intense, and I daresay gives a different view from following the series over a couple of years. This volume, though I didn't like it at first, turned out the most varied and interesting of all in storyline, effect perhaps augmented by the variety of guest artists, and more depth for a few characters.The hollowness, cynicism and meta-commentary behind the gorgeous mythical pop-tropes (which, as a big fan ofPhonogramI both loved, and hated to see reused until hackneyed) seemed even more overwhelming in the first half of vol. 3 than they had in 1-2, knowingly illustrative of an internet youth culture in which everything is analysed, memed and problematised, and nothing can feel fresh and joyful. (Both the comic and this review are the work of jaded people born in the 70s, and I don't think it's possible to know exactly what it all feels like from the inside, no matter how many Tumblrs you read, without actually being younger and experiencing this stuff in your teens and twenties. Maybe the culture isn't quite so hopeless and recursive, and some of it does feel new, if you haven't been alive as long. )Then I started to see that, via the characters of Tara, Woden, Amaterasu and Cassandra, issues 13-15 were a multi-sided commentary on internet social justice issues, including, but not limited to those affecting comics. (I mostly hear about the comics world second-hand, through friends and articles; it may be that commentary about these controversieswithincomics themselves has itself become a dull cliche. Meanwhile I haven't encountered it directly before, and some of the analyses here were interesting, and welcome in their balance.) This was part of a pretty dark phase of the story, in issues 12 to partway through 15. The title, exhaustively knowing as ever, alludes to the difficult uncommercial album that sees off some fans; the mood also evoked those bad-decadent periods of the typical rock biography when everyone's at each other's throats and getting paranoid from the drugs. (I usually find those albums & biography chapters interesting, but here I understood the more typical negative responses: early-teenWicDivwasn't a type of darkness I found comfortable, and I was waiting and hoping for the story arc to go up again. It doesn't faze me that most of the cast are destined to die soon - I see things much as one character says later in the wonderful issue 16:We're all walking dead. we're all at the edge of that pit. But we get to choose what we do whilst we're here...I'm dancing.They say that having experienced not being able to choose anything, or 'dance'; so it's not naive thoughtlessness disregarding more limited existences, just a statement of how they feel, that day. Meanwhile, these darkest episodes ofWicDivwere uncomfortable because there was precious little 'dancing'.)Tara's story is one that's been frequently told in the last few years, about misogynistic bullying and a woman who feels she's only been valued - if and when she is valued at all - for her appearance and for who people think she is or want her to be, not for who she [feels she] really is. In vol.2 Amaterasu lamented (paraphrase) that she herself was boring because she was straight: meanwhile, this is the dark, unpleasantly media-worthy side of that. Tara also evokes those celebrities, who, sometimes for no apparent reason as here, have become love-to-hate figures and objects of derision, an invisible 'kick me' sign permanently pinned to them, and the story reflects how stressful it might be to be them, increasingly unable to do anything right in the eyes of the public and commentariat. She had experiences that make the following feel universally true to her, rather than merely the case with certain nasty pieces of work (my second clause is implied nowhere in the book):I heard ""Hey goddess, hey beautiful"" turn into ""I'm going to rape you bitch"" enough times to know that the former is just the latter with a bow on it.In the way it takes up a fourth-wave feminist mantle wholesale and perhaps as fanservice, I found this issue somewhat similar to the New Year episode ofSherlock. (Although it wasn't quite so out of step with established characters. And given its awareness of online social justice politics, had surprisingly little to say about Tara's pre-goddess life as a girl of Pakistani descent.) Where it was - depressingly - enlightening, though, was in the two pages of abusive tweets it printed. Often, I suspect, the worst of these things aren't shown, in press articles, and certainly not in a Reggie Yates documentary I saw recently in which he was shown interviewing Laurie Penny and looking at some tweets that the camera never focused on. Knowing Yates' oddly yet usefully innocent manner as a presenter, I suspect what he saw wasn't as bad as two of the 'tweets' here - which I was surprised actually to find quite shocking, and contained specifics that I'd never even seen mentioned as actions in popular serial killer or horror stories. (Some people would surely therefore want warnings re. reading that whole first page of tweets.)The basically Vader-suited Woden (one of the less mythologically convincing incarnations) - though another GR reviewer rightly mentions Daft Punk as a basis for his look - has some surprisingly complex things to say. He's partly a portrait of a type of stubborn male commenter on feminist articles, and of a slightly different type, the perhaps sociopathic sort of cynical man who makes use of feminism for his own ends - but in these scenes he also becomes more than a caricature, and a way for the writers to make some worthwhile points. Importantly - and unlike Tara's story - the writing doesn't recycle the exact statements commonly seen from below-the-line commenters, those ones that mean you don't bother reading comments because you've seen it all before. Mirroring the authoritarian left's tactics to shut down and invalidate argument, Woden has his own nihilistic ways to do so from a different side, for example by acknowledging how patriarchal societies are bad for many men and then not caring about anything because he won't live to see the future - and with slippery, headfucky ultimate cynicism like the following, that could make the listener question everything he and others have said:You want to control someone? Give them a slice of the truth that confirms all their prejudices.The gender-based power structure inWicDivdefies straightforward analysis,although so far no macho god has died. And the underlying logic is dark, inspired as it was apparently by death and bereavement:the real villain is fate, what can you do about that?The argument between Amaterasu and Cassandra is more easily encapsulated by its dialogue - and frankly it's an easier one to win (but then I would say that as I agree with its conclusions).A:You're the one who sees everything in black and white. You care about ideals more than people. You don't care that your ideals are hurting people. You don't care that people are hurting.The characters provide recursive, hall-of-mirrors, commentary on the offensiveness potential of their scene set in Japan, a scene ultimately created so they can talk about cultural appropriation.Later, Cassandra, referring to a shared past on Tumblr:If you ever liked anything I wrote, you have to know this, you're doing it wrong.(Black and white again - she has a very all or nothing concept of liking. On here, people often like posts whilst not agreeing with every sentence. Though some particular sentences may be too disagreeable, so you withhold the like from the other 99%. Besides, likes can mean all sorts: ""glad you enjoyed this, I did too"", ""thanks for drawing this to my attention"", ""yes I'm still speaking to you/ I hope you're okay"".)I've been wondering if Tumblr kids, queer / feminist teens and twentysomethings are actually quite a big audience for comics and to a lesser extent SFF - if all this content isn't just about who's been making noise, but about the stats, and producing stuff a significant audience will probably like.I absolutely love issue 16, a mostly realistic comic about pre-fame Morrigan and Baphomet. (The Goodreads single-issue ratings suggest I'm far from alone in this. It's actually good, it's not just that on some level I've always been a bit of a goth, even if I don't have quite the matching wardrobe and record collection). Both Marian and Cameron are both hot, and romantic in an intelligent, stormy gothic kitchen-sink kind of way. Like Tara and Sekhmet, they appear to have reached their mid-twenties before the gods incarnated into them, more interesting for the reader well past their own teens. The art was great too, by Leila del Duca - who I was surprised to find does superhero type comics rather than realistic, so well does her style suit this story. I liked this episode so much, it was going to be difficult not to give the whole volume four stars in the afterglow of reading it. Sekhmet's backstory was good, a change from the mostly middle-class characters, and her incarnation's predatory nature provides a foil to Tara's sacrificial victimhood, but I wasn't sure about the art here. I don't go for 'messy' art styles generally, but whilst it really didn't work for gig scenes, it did give plot-appropriate visual chaos to the life of a character who previously looked sleek and fully in control. (I'm surprised so many other readers disliked it, as I thought high volume comics readers were well au fait with the idea of guest artists via webcomics, and were more open minded than I am about different styles.)Oh yes, what it is these days with its having been cool to like The Bluetones? All these 'Slight Returns' here for instance - and it's not just here. Not bothered so much as baffled; I'm not aware of any other minor band (apparently bland at the time, though very definitely hummable) whose stock seems to have gone up in such a way.In McKelvie's ""video"" shorts in the end gallery, I was very fond of Inanna'sMy regrets are the one thing I don't regret., although he seemed too young and too nice to have cause to say that. If you're older and you've pissed a few people off who didn't deserve it, it's only decent to have some regrets - and it may be a reminder not to make the same mistakes again. Yet it's unpopular in popular culture to suggest regret has any value. The series' strange mix of soundbite shallowness + wisdom continues.Would I read more if I could, if vol 4 was around now? Yes.Wasn't Laura's return entirely predictable though, if she's Persephone?(WicDivhas also made me keener to readYoung Avengers.) The difficult third album sure as hell wasn't as pretty, but it was interesting.This was a free advance copy received from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25853351-the-wicked-the-divine-vol-3,"The Wicked + The Divine, Vol. 3 Commercial Suicide.txt"
"The Wicked + The Divine, Vol. 1: The Faust Act","Well, hello, gorgeous cover!The Wicked and the Divine has a very interesting concept. It's like a rough spin on something we're are all completely familiar with: Pop Stars. They're everywhere, they are addicting, they are our idols. In this beautifully illustrated graphic novel,the gods are the pop stars and the pop stars are the gods.Everyone would love to be them, they worship them but alas, they die within two years. They can have all their glory and fame only for two years and they get reincarnated after ninety years.Don't ask me why. The first volume didn't go into the very fine details of their existence and their reincarnations and all the hows' and whys' but I'm hoping the later volumes would clear all these questions.This graphic novel contains a lot of characters, most of them are Gods from different religions and folklores. I wasn't too familiar with the Gods themselves but Wikipedia is always our dear old friend.Meet Laura, our very easy-to-relate to main character:Laura is human. She's a die-hard fan of the Gods. And she would do anything to be one of them. I can completely understand her. It's always very nice when your main character is easy to understand and connect with.The story starts off with Laura attending a concert where she is completely mesmerized with a God named Amaterasu who is a sun goddess according to the Japanese mythology. Among the twelve Gods mentioned in this book, she is the only one with a lot of patience and kindness.Isn't the artwork just utterly beautiful?It was during this concert that a very famous goddess named Luci (short for Lucifer) speaks to Laura. This incident immediately pulls our main character into a series of completely mysterious events in which Laura is very happy to help the Gods because all she ever wanted was a taste of their powers.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I, most of all, loved the artwork. Heck, I think I'm going to sketch these characters because they're so damn beautiful. It's the best artwork I've seen so far.Just look at the beauty! My fingers are itching for my pencils!The characters in this book are from different races and they are completely unique and extremely gorgeous and most of them are female. The diversity in these characters is something I also loved very much about because it is quite rare to have so many characters from different races in a graphic novel. These characters stretched and grew so much in this book, it was just so fascinating to watch them.I feel like this book tries to tell us that celebrities are just as influential as religion and what good we get out of it is the biggest ambiguous question here. Gillen has taken on a very intriguing concept which will stay on the readers mind long after reading.The characters, to be specific, the Gods are diverse in this book and now I will try my best to explain what powers they have and which mythologies they originate from. (Don't let this extra reading scare you away.)Luci aka Lucifer:The Prince of darkness and all things evil is portrayed as an androgynous woman in this graphic novel. She's a very interesting character who is still exploring her various capabilities. I think all the gods are trying to understand how much they can extend themselves. Remember, they didn't sign up for this.Amaterasu:Like I mentioned earlier, she is a sun goddess and also one of the kindest among the Gods. She has two brothers, Susanoo who is mentioned briefly in the beginning and Tsukuyomi who is not mentioned so far. According to his book, she spreads this addictive kind of euphoria while she sings in her concerts and that's one of the reasons why everyone just simply adores her.Sakhmet:Doesn't she look a bit like Rihanna?Sakhmet is the lion headed goddess from the Egyptian mythology who is associated with vengeance, warfare, healing and various other things. We don't see much of her in this volume as much as I wanted to.The Morrigan:The Morrigan is undoubtedly one of the most interesting characters in this book. She could be extremely confusing if you don't know Irish mythology. She is three people. She switches according to her mood. She's known as the Phantom Queen and is considered to be the goddess of battle and death and also is said to take the form of a crow. It is also said that she can tell who would live and who would die in a battle and this was an inspiration to a very common mythical creature called a banshee whose screams also predict death.I really liked this character a lot. She was so very intriguing and I cannot wait to know more about her.Baphomet:He's kinda hot, isn't he?He's known as the False God and is associated with paganism and witchcraft. We encounter him briefly in the book.Baal:The name Baal is not a specific god but it's used as Semitic term to any god worshipped in the Near East. His symbol is a goat and I honestly don't know much about him. He does make quite a few appearances in the book and his various powers are yet to be known.Ananke:She is the destiny decider and a very, very powerful person. She is portrayed as a protector of the Gods in this book and all the decisions regarding them are made by her.There are several other Gods but they haven't been mentioned a lot in this book and I'm hoping the later volumes will have more info about them.Even though there are lots to be researched about these gods, I think this is a pretty incredible graphic novel. It would be amazing as a movie or a TV show. (Please make it a movie or a TV show!) I know for certain that this is one of the best graphic novels I've read in 2014 and I very highly recommend it.____________________________________________A little something I drew from this gorgeous comic.

I can't wait to sketch the rest of the characters!)",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23093359-the-wicked-the-divine-vol-1,"The Wicked + The Divine, Vol. 1 The Faust Act.txt"
Over The Garden Wall #4,"3.5 / 5Pros- The art style is evocative of the show, and continues its visual aesthetic- The story fits in well with the ""Over the Garden Wall"" universe, and dovetails with the showCons- The work is very short, coming in at only 24 pages (with extra content, like sheet music)- These comics take place between the episodes of the miniseries (though this one is a prequel of sorts), and little character growth is possible as a result. As the comic series has gone on, it has become increasingly clear to me that these comics would be hard to enjoy without the context of the show.- One of the strengths of the show was its ability to convey a variety of tones and emotions (happiness, sadness, danger, horror, and more). This comic is definitely the most grounded and darkest of the four (compared to the other three comics' more whimsical tone), but it still misses the tone of the show. It's hard to be mad about this, given the length constraints at play, but the work can't avoid drawing comparison to its source material. After all, it is taking place in the same universe, features the same characters, and is written by the same people.ConclusionOver the Garden Wallfans will almost assuredly enjoy this work, as it's more of their beloved characters in wacky situations. Folks who haven't watched the show may not be as dazzled by the work, and honestly, can probably pass on it.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28000095-over-the-garden-wall-4,Over The Garden Wall #4.txt
Over The Garden Wall #3,"Amé éste por los animalitos, principalmente. Éste tomo fue divertidísimo. Me hubiera gustado mucho verlo plasmado en la TV, aunque no tuviera realmente mucho que ver con la línea original de la serie.En el camino a Adelaide, Greg empieza a escuchar música, así que se desvía del camino junto con su rana para ver qué es lo que ocurre. Wirt y Beatrice no tienen otra alternativa que seguirles.Ahí encuentran un montón de animalitos muy animados bailando alrededor de un árbol de peras. Hay un extraño animal (una mezcla de muchos animales) que está tocando el acordeón y cantando sobre que los animales felices danzan alrededor del peral.Beatrice se distrae un poco intentando localizar la salida, y cuando regresa a ver a sus acompañantes, éstos parecen haberse convertido en un oso y en un pato al comer de las peras de aquél peral extraño. Beatrice no entiende qué está sucediendo, intenta hablar con ellos, pero ni Wirt ni Greg logran responderle realmente (más que con sonidos de animal).El final es definitivamente uno de los mejores de todos. Beatrice confiesa que los ha estado engañando sobre ir a ver a Adelaide y, sinceramente, aunque parecía una buena idea confesarlo así, me pareció mucho mejor cómo lo hace en la serie.Por otro lado, éste cómic fue divertidísimo (sí, ya sé que ya lo dije). Creo que ha de ser mi favorito. Mi parte favorita es Greg explicando su teoría sobre los pares de peras:Greg: “Pero, ¿por qué no comer UNA de ellas? Porque cuando tienes dos peras, y te comes una, todavía tienes dos peras, porque 'un par' siempre son dos. Así que, dos pares en realidad son cuatro peras, y cuatro peras son ocho peras, hasta que llegas al infinito.

"Hexed: The Harlot & The Thief, Vol. 2","This second volume of the rebooted series, also currently available on Kindle Unlimited, forms the first half of a two-parter with volume three.The authors seem to have finally realised just what they had in this story universe. Rather than the bland high jinx of the previous book, they delve into the background of Mme Cymbaline and of the Harlot, as well as into the relationship between the Harlot and the Thief. Finally, there is some depth and emotion in the telling, although it tends to the sentimental, even to the mawkish.Overall, the story is resolved satisfactorily, making reference back to the original miniseries, and tying up all of the story threads that had been left hanging in that miniseries as well as the previous volume of this series. The story is a big action spectacular, not particularly coherent, but entertaining.The plot relies on too many easy solutions and there are too many tough-talk stand-offs to my taste. It’s still more of a superhero adventure than a paranormal mystery. Our protagonist always knows just what to do and she does not put one foot wrong. The action unfolds without real jeopardy, except that no one thinks to protect the gallery owner. That character’s death is a significant failure of the protagonist, who throws a vengeful tantrum rather than learning and growing. A real opportunity for character development has been squandered there. The convenient and conventional final scenes set up more of the same in episodes to come, rather than giving the sense of finality and closure such a tying up of lose ends requires. Really, this could have become a powerful story but it’s held back by safe comic conventions. So the score remains three rather than four stars.As to the art, it’s still very good, but a little less crisp than in the first volume of this series. It’s all action comic conventions.Overall, the second and third volumes of this series are better than the first. But there still isn’t the intriguing quality of the original miniseries.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25986935-hexed,"Hexed The Harlot & The Thief, Vol. 2.txt"
Marceline Gone Adrift #4,"In 'Marceline Gone Adrift' well renowned singer and Vampire Queen Marceline has lost her creative buzz. In a sudden and unusual catastrophe Marceline is blasted out into space. Princess Bubblegum embarks on a mission to save her and leaves the Candy Kingdom to slowly fall apart in her absence. A heartwarming story about love, friendship and creativity this is a must-read for all Adventure Time fans.I really enjoyed reading 'Marceline Gone Adrift'; I'm a big fan of the Marceline and Princess Bubblegum pairing so any comics that go further into their story are a big yes from me. The story is split into chapters which makes it easier to read in short chunks and a lot easier to put down when you need to. I did have slight issue with the narration of the story; it's split into the povs of different characters which can make reading it fairly confusing at times as it's tricky to keep track of everyone's story and remember the events that have just happened for them. However, I did find this a thoroughly enjoyable read.I would recommend a previous knowledge of Adventure Time/Marceline and Princess Bubblegum if you're intending to read this comic.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25366510-marceline-gone-adrift-4,Marceline Gone Adrift #4.txt

"InuYasha, Vol. 6: Wounded Souls","*This review is for the series as a whole with 4.5 out of 5 stars*This series is absolutely the longest series I’ve ever read so far, with a total of 56 volumes containing 559 chapters. Yeah right? I grew up watching anime and when I stumbled to this one, I instantly got hook. I’m so in love with this anime that I have the complete anime series in my possession. Yep! It occupy mostly the memory of my external drive haha sucker I know. And it’s just now that I finally had the courage to read its manga. I started reading this last December but had a 1 week off because of the Holiday until finally I finished it!This story is about this modern Japanese girl, Kagome, that was pulled from her own time and went to feudal Japan. It is where she met the half yokai (supernatural monster in Japanese folklore) or also called Hanyou, Inuyasha. Two opposite personalities that were forced to travel together because of the Shikon Jewel or the Jewel of Four Souls.Kagome (female lead) is so much fun and a wonderful heroine. If she’s a real person, she could be my hero. And Inuyasha on the other hand is such an awesome badass that thinking about him hurts. And as a couple, they sure are mind blowing. After writing this review, I’ll definitely re-watch the anime hehe.Speaking of which, Inuyasha is a bad boy. But he’s the awesome kind of bad boy with humor and with a touch of dumbness at the same time. When he first met Kagome, I swear he could really be a great pain in the ass and is a straight-up a-hole. And as the story progresses, he became this kind of awesome person without losing his bad boy image ofcourse. And when it comes to Kagome, he sure is kind of protective and I love their usual bantering. It could get annoying sometimes but mostly entertaining lol, especially when Kagome really gets angry at him.His character is so realistic too. Behind the bad boy image is the guy who lost his first love and when she returned, he’s torn between her and Kagome. Which to be honest, made me kind of mad at him. Well, I’m 100% with Kagome and I totally hate Kikyou. But after reading the manga, I still don’t like her, but she is kind of likeable now especially when she saved Kohaku. And also Inuyasha’s inner battle with his demon blood and his human heart, and you know what’s awesome about it? It’s because it’s only Kagome who can make him back to his senses, isn’t that just sweet?(I was a bit teary-eyed when the Spider youkai were after them and he got bitten while he’s in his human form. And speaking of human form, he sure still rock it even with black hair minus the cute doggy ears. Then he lay on Kagome’s lap and told her that he love her scent even if he told her otherwise before. They’re in the middle of a dangerous situation but because of that, it became kind of romantic and unforgettable scene for me.)Kagome on the other hand is a typical female lead. She started as a helpless girl until they found out about her being the reincarnation of Kikyou which was Inuyasha’s first love and the strongest Miko in the feudal Japan. I love how she became badass as the story progresses. Kikyou may be the first woman Inuyasha loved, but it is Kagome who really changed Inuyasha as a person. Plus, did I tell you how many times she saved Kikyou? Also, even how many times she got hurt because she’s Inuyasha’s first love, her heart remains pure.I have to be honest, there’s some point in this series that totally got my nerve and made me flipped. That’s mostly about Inuyasha being torn between Kikyou and Kagome and how many times he chose Kikyou over Kagome. I mean, that’ quite of cruel really. But even that’s the case, I learn to outgrow it simply because he still travels with her, plus, once in a while they have their own moments. And speaking of moment, I need to step ahead and point out the lack of kissing scenes between them. In anime there’s quite a lot, but in manga, almost none. Yeah right?As they travel, their group of two grows into a group of 6 where they met the kitsune Shippou, the monk Miroku, cool Sango and her cute Kirara.Shippouis a cute Kitsune (fox) yokai that specializes in making pranks which he mostly use to Inuyasha lol. At first, they both hate each other and argues which is kind of funny lol. But as they both travels together, their relationship improved. He is really adorable and so attached to Kagome.Miroku– A playboy and pervert who loves caressing women’s butt. But his proposal to Sango was pretty sweet.Sango– a really tough cookie. I love her character and the fact that she can man handle guys. And her relationship with Miroku was so kawaii.(Quite cliche eh? Inuyasha and Kagome fell in love with each other and Miroku, Sango with each other too. Well, IDC haha. I just love their group.)Kirara– is a cute yokai that transforms into a ferocious beast during battles. Plus, he flies!With a very long series, a long list of character isn’t a surprise at all. But what’s really hard with manga or anime is to get familiarize with the character’s names. But as for my favorites or the ones that totally got my attention here’s my list. (I’m being mean today, so I’m not going to add Kikyou in my list, blee)1. Number one in my list isSesshoumaru. I never thought I’d say this, but I’m one of those really annoying fangirls who love him. Deym! When I first saw him in the anime, I’ve got to say that there’s something dangerous about him. Inuyasha has this bad boy image, but Sesshoumaru is on the highest level. I really hate him at first. Unlike Inuyasha, he really is living the bad boy life. He’s rude, full of pride and all things bad. I specifically hated how he keeps on stealing their Father’s memento, Tessaiga, that is originally given to I But everything changed when he met Rin, and then we got to find out about Tenseiga and everything about it. Then, it just happens, I love Sesshoumaru. And then I came to the part about Meidou Zangetsuha, I feel so sorry for him. Huhu, and then after that my admiration for him intensified. He made me feel so many emotions, I almost cried because of him. It will take too much writing if I’ll enumerate the things that made me love Sesshoumaru so I’ll just let these images speaks for itself.2. Well, obviously, it’sRin. I love her character simply because she’s the reason why Sesshoumaru became compassionate, which is also the reason how he was now able to use his healing sword T And I love her teasing with Jaken. I love how the boring team of two grows and became lively because of her.Honestly, at first, I’m one of those fans that ships Rin to Sesshoumaru. But after I read the manga, I realized how absurd that is. I don’t know, but I think Jaken is right. Sesshoumaru is like a father to Rin in a strange way, and he sure is a great one.3.Kagome’s family, her mother, younger brother Shouta, grandpa including their cat Buyo. I thought it’s going to be a big shocker when they met Inuyasha, but end up petting him like a pet dog lol. They’re all touching Inuyasha’s ears haha. Well, that couldn’t be help lol especially if he has that adorable doggy ears.4.Kouga– The moment he was introduced in this series, I can’t stop laughing. He’s the third party between Inuyasha and Kagome and I can’t really stop laughing whenever I remember the scene where he boldly said that he loves Kagome and he’s determine to make her his woman. Well, after what Kagome went through because of Kikyou, I can’t help but send Inuyasha a dirty sign. Blee!5.Miyouga– The coward flea. He’s some sort of the guy who knows it all, well, not totally all but mostly about Inuyasha and his father. I wish this series was able to show something about the past especially about Inuyasha’s father and mother. Well, it did actually in the anime.6.Totosai– The swordsmith who forged Tessaiga and Tenseiga due to Inuyasha and Sesshoumaru’s father’s request. I would have love it more if they included a back story of him too.7.Kaede– Kikyou’s younger sister. A strong lady who would probably live another 50 years the way she’s going.8.Kohaku– The younger brother of Sango. For a young age, he’s been through a lot. But I’m happy how he was able to regain or fight for his humanity after what Naraku did to him.9.Jaken– Originally, I didn’t have the intention of adding him in this list but looking back, I have to say that he made my whole reading experience so enjoyable too. He’s Sesshoumaru’s companion. He’s arrogant and even pitiful sometimes especially when he receives death glare or punches from Sesshoumaru when he’s pissed but he is mostly funny especially when Rin joined the group.10.Naraku– For the ultimate cunning supervilain, I guess he quite deserve to be in this list lol. He’s a hanyou like Inuyasha. He’s the reason why Kikyou died 50 years ago and is the reason why Kikyou and Inuyasha had a rough past.When I think about it, this is obviously a typical adventure anime/manga. For an adventure stories, the idea of different set of individuals forming a group while traveling is quite cliche too, let alone falling in love with each other! But what sets this story different from others is on the adventures each characters went through. When I though it’s the end and the ideas are already sucked out dry from the author, we then introduced to a new unexpected scene. I’ve been watching anime and they all gave me the same reaction. And what is that? It’s astonishment. We might already encountered the story’s plot before, but the twists and turns, the scenes, the lines are so unique. I can’t count how many times I said out loud “I didn’t expected that!” while reading this series.All we’re covered too. I love that each characters has their own background covered, so we all got the chance to really know more about them and where they come from. I love that each characters have the chance to stand out and we’ve got to see how they matured with each chapters. As the title goes, without watching the anime, I really thought this series would only revolves around Inuyasha, well, it kind of does since each characters have a connection with Inuyasha. But what I like to say is that the author didn’t made a selfish decision to just make Inuyasha the hero all the time. We’ve got the chance to see the weaker side of him, the annoying one, the part where others from the group became the hero and saved him, and ofcourse the funny and dense Inuyasha which is my favorite.As I said, this series has a total of 559 chapters so it will absolutely take us a lot of time if I talk about the adventures the group encountered one by one. So to make it short, I’ll just “kind of share” my favorite chapters from this series. Before I decided to read this manga, I have a lot of favorite scenes from the anime, mostly? Well, all of them we’re from Kagome and Inuyasha. But after reading the manga, I have to say that my favorite scenes were from Sesshoumaru (Inuyasha’s youkai brother). The first one was when he met Rin (human girl) and resurrected her. I really love how little by little he changed from this full mean badboy image to a compassionate one. He’s still a badboy but when he’s with Rin, dayum, I just can’t help but squeal in delight. And another favorite scene was when he went inside the meidou (a place where the living are not suppose to go) to save Rin. It’s also the most touching scene ever because of how he discarded his sword tenseiga (his father’s memento) because it can’t save Rin. Like dang! (just zoom the image to read the lines)For my rating, I’m detracting a half star. It really is painful but I guess I really need to. It’s because even with the 559 chapters, it failed to tell us an introduction of what really is a yokai or hanyou or everything about those so-called monster. I mean, it’s been 50 years after that the story resumed but Sesshoumaru look as fabulous as ever and so is Inuyasha. I mean, if Inuyasha and Kagome will live together as man and wife, Kagome will age and Inuyasha would still be looking the same? The slowness of the villains too is quite so-so but I understand that to make this series long. Also, about crossing time through the well, in its first few chapters, we’ve got to find out that it’s the Shikon Jewel that connects the two worlds, but I remembered after Naraku seized all the shards of the Jewel, Kagome was still able to go back to her world. That really is kinda confusing though. And lastly, the epilogue. Dang! Sango and Miroku had their three little angels, how come Inuyasha and Kagome didn’t have atleast 1 son or daughter?! Oh well, I guess you can’t really have all.You might be wondering which one of the two I love, manga or anime, I have to say that I love both. All the scenes from manga can be seen in anime, but what’s great with anime is that there’s some new scenes added to it. So if you’re planning to read the manga, I would highly recommend watching the anime too.I would highly recommend this series, if you’re down for a good solid adventure and a kickass heroine with a sexy demon badboy. It’s often hilariously funny and the drawing is so lovely. It’s just simply awesome.Rating: 4.5 out of 5 starsRead my full review postTo read more of my reviews, book news and updates:Main Blog: Blushing GeekFacebook PageSubscribe to mailing list",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/330748.InuYasha_Vol_6,"InuYasha, Vol. 6 Wounded Souls.txt"
Batman by Scott Snyder & Greg Capullo Omnibus Vol. 1,"Pues primera parte del Batman de Scott Snyder y Greg Capullo releída, y lo primero que me he llevado ha sido una sorpresa. Recordaba haber leído esta etapa en su momento con mucho interés, especialmente la primera parte de la historia, con la aparición de El Tribunal de los Búhos, aunque siempre me ha parecido que Snyder le había dado a sus historias (o había recibido de la editorial) un bombo que no llegaba a cumplir. Y el caso es que en esta relectura, incluso la parte de El Tribunal de los Búhos se me ha hecho demasiado pomposa, como si estuviera demasiado alargada, y esa es la sensación general que me ha dejado el tomo: historias estiradas y bastante pretenciosas.Este primer tomo podría dividirse fácilmente en cinco arcos, aunque dos de ellos realmente son el mismo, los dos primeros: El Tribunal de los Búhos y La Noche de los Búhos. Y la verdad es que el primero es el más sugerente de todos. En él, Batman va a descubrir que un viejo mito de la historia de Gotham, el Tribunal de los Búhos, es menos mítico de lo que él había pensado. Así, nos vamos a encontrar con un enemigo que se esconde en el interior de Gotham, un enemigo con muchos rostros y que podría ser cualquiera. Lo malo es que todo este misterio se va al garete, ya que en lugar de ser sutiles, el Tribunal de los Búhos envía a cazar a sus garras, unos ninjas asesinos muy poco discretos pero que van a centrar buena parte del protagonismo del arco. Además, en estas páginas se va a presentar a un secundario que será relevante más adelante, por ejemplo en la ya comentada Batman Eterno, Lincoln March, que aparece como posible aliado de Bruce Wayne... Y vamos a adentrarnos en la historia del Circo Haly y la relación de Dick Grayson con las Garras y el Tribunal... Y tras este primer arco, va a haber un segundo que es continuación directa, La Noche de los Búhos, en el que todo el secreto del tribunal se va a ir al garete cuando deciden enviar a todas sus Garras en plan masivo a acabar con Batman y sus aliados. Así que vamos a tener a diferentes Garras que se van a enfrentar a Batman, Nightwing, Red Robin, Robin, Batgirl, Batwoman y todo el grupo, por lo que toda la parte de investigación de la primera parte (tiene una escena genial en un laberinto donde cambia el propio orden de las viñetas y se lee en todas direcciones), queda arrastrada por un mar de testosterona gratuita y recursos manidos.A La Noche de los Búhos le va a seguir La Muerte de la Familia, la reaparición del Joker en Batman, y que se basa en una hipotética infiltración que podría haber sufrido la Batcueva mucho tiempo atrás por el Joker, y como su ataque a Alfred y al resto de la familia va a poner en peligro no ya la vida, sino las relaciones entre Batman y sus aliados, recurriendo a una ya repetida idea de que los secretos de Batman terminan haciendo daño a todo el mundo a su alrededor. Después de La Muerte de la Familia, vamos a tener una minisaga que podría ser algo así como Batman vs Clayface, en la que Clayface va a desarrollar la habilidad de copiar a los personajes a los que replica a nivel genético, lo que va a llevar a que Batman termine enfrentándose ni más ni menos que a Bruce Wayne...Y por último, el punto álgido (en teoría) de esta etapa de Snyder sería la larga Año Cero, aquí conocida como Origen, y en la que Snyder se retrotraía a los primeros tiempos de Batman, con un Bruce Wayne recién llegado a la ciudad después de recorrer el mundo para entrenar. En Origen, vamos a tener dos tramas, una en la que Batman hace frente a la banda de las Capuchas Rojas con un remedo de lo que podría ser la creación del Joker, y un enfrentamiento con el Acertijo que pone Gotham en una situación auténticamente desesperada, y lo que me choca mucho es que no hayan incluido Origen en las historias que inspiraron The Batman, con situaciones absolutamente calcadas.Y... pues bueno, eso. Que como diría Bilbo, es poca mantequilla en mucho pan, y le doy el aprobado porque la verdad es que de siempre me ha gustado mucho Greg Capullo, y aquí se le disfruta mucho.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44473977-batman-by-scott-snyder-greg-capullo-omnibus-vol-1,Batman by Scott Snyder & Greg Capullo Omnibus Vol. 1.txt
Batman - Shaman,"The classic Batman series from the 1990s is collected in a new graphic novel series with three tales by some of the Dark Knight's greatest writers: Grant Morrison, Dennis O'Neil and Doug Moench.First, in a story written by legendary Batman writer Dennis O'Neil, Batman returns from a case to find Alfred missing, while rumors of human sacrifice and strange, primitive rituals circulate in Gotham City. The second story, written by Grant Morrison and featuring art by Klaus Janson (BATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS), the Dark Knight Detective must defeat an immortal killer while dealing with a terrifying horror from Bruce Wayne's youth. And in the third story, written by Doug Moench with art by Paul Gulacy, Batman confronts one of his oldest foes, Dr. Hugo Strange, who has formed a Gotham City task force to stop the Dark Knight.Collects BATMAN: LEGENDS OF THE DARK KNIGHT #1-15.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40003447-batman---shaman,Batman - Shaman.txt
Batman: The Imposter,"In just three years, the Batman has made a huge impact on Gotham crime - but that good work is threatening to be undone as footage of “Batman” executing unarmed prisoners emerges. There’s an imposter out there - but who? Batman and Detective Blair Wong set out to uncover the mystery.Mattson Tomlin is one of the screenwriters on the Rob Pattinson Batman movie out this week which I’m sure is how he got to write a Batman comic despite having no previous comics credits. And The Imposter reads like a proper comic but it’s also not a very good one either.Tomlin’s Batman is younger than usual - early to mid-20s - with a more grounded take on the character and his world, focusing on how someone could realistically be Batman: setting up zip lines around the city, rather than relying on the dubious grappling hook, and stashing motorbikes to get around quickly. It makes me wonder if this is what we can expect from the Pattinson movie too.Not that that’s a bad thing in itself (there’s a detail over why he’s not got access to his family’s billions that’s a clever touch) but I think Tomlin’s fallen into a typical pitfall when writing Batman which is that he's gone much too dark and overly serious. Sure it’s more grounded but it’s also not fun. Sometimes a deathly serious tone works but it’s better if a writer has earned that right by building up to it in a series - which Tomlin hasn’t.Andrea Sorrentino’s realistic art works well with the story approach, and he does his best to make the pages lively despite Tomlin’s verbose script, but the effect sometimes is that the pages look too busy for what is often a fairly straightforward scene - there’s too many boxes and word balloons cluttering things up, so many of the pages don’t breathe. The lack of colour too adds to the oppressively gloomy atmosphere of the book.Elements like one character having the same tragic backstory as Bruce, implied domestic abuse between Wesker and his son, and another character blowing their brains out don’t help either. At the end of the day, it’s a story about two guys dressing up as bats and fighting each other - I’m not saying it should swing to the Batman ‘66 end of the spectrum but a little levity would’ve gone a long way.Still, I appreciated that Tomlin didn’t pick any of Batman’s usual rogues for the story - Arnold Wesker/The Ventriloquist and Otis Flannegan/Ratcatcher are the two here, both depicted less as villains and more as broken, sad people (realism!). The overall coldness of the book is I think partly due to Alfred, who often serves as the warm heart of Batman, and Gordon, a stalwart confidante, both being excluded from the story - in this timeline Alfred abandons Bruce while he’s still in school and Gordon’s off the GCPD for reasons - so Leslie Thompkins, presented here as Bruce’s therapist, has to step in to nurse Batman’s wounds.Mirroring seems to be a theme in this story: the Imposter is Batman without his moral code, and Wong is Bruce without his money/desire to mete out vigilante justice, although neither seem to be presented as options we should be favouring. Because what Bruce and Batman are in this book instead is kind of a boring alternative to both: humourless, dull, and quite one-dimensional overall - effective though, apparently.The romance subplot didn’t really add anything and felt contrived while the reveal of the Imposter’s identity was underwhelming. There are also a couple of sloppy narrative beats, like when some robbers say “He’s real?!” when they see Batman, as if we’re meant to believe no-one in Gotham has seen this figure over the past three years despite having such a supposedly seismic effect on crime. And then later on Batman breaks into Wesker’s facility effortlessly but he needs Wong’s help to break into the GCPD? Come on, it’s the same thing.There’s not a whole lot to recommend The Imposter. The main draw is Andrea Sorrentino’s art but details here and there show that Mattson Tomlin has put some thought into his realistic take on the character, and it’s a fairly coherent narrative. However it’s also uninteresting, too grim, and ultimately very forgettable. Here’s hoping the new Batman movie is more compelling.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58801669-batman,Batman The Imposter.txt
Batman by Grant Morrison Omnibus Vol. 1,"Instantly, the vibes of this book are impeccable. I’ve read few 00s Batman runs, and I was hesitant that it would feel tonally toothless or tangibly campy to the point where we’d become immediately taken out of the story. I love the “dark” in Dark Knight after all, and while I didn’t expect a Snyder or King-esque Batman, I did hope for something at least consistent with that style of Batman. The LAST thing I expected was something that HANDILY eclipsed both. I’ll talk what I liked about the story arcs and end with conclusions.The chaotic stories we get at the beginning of Bruce’s rebirth to spite the horrors of his life were such great tone-setters for this tale. It is initially a confusing interlude that seems to have little to do with everything else in the story. However, the sparks set here light a fire that burns well into the rest of the story, and I feel like it’s so important to praise that these seemingly random stories stand on their own! Hickman and King's foreshadowing would frequently made me feel like I was accidentally reading the wrong comic, and while that misdirection or mystery can still be a lot of fun, Morrison’s foreshadowing didn’t break my immersion for a second! The exact opposite, in fact—the question of how you get a goose out of a bottle without injuring it or breaking the bottleactuallybeing a metaphor for how words are often a prison for our imagination? Absolutely something that will stick with me. Incredible how even this stays relevant throughout the book.Batman and Son was immediately more intense than the adaptation. Damien is surprisingly even more precocious, insubordinate, and cruel than he is in the movie, and having the lawful good Tim Drake be the foil is an exciting complication. While the extra layers explored in the movie about the lore of Ra's are fun, Damian's brutality is shocking and far more interesting to see Batman have to deal with.I have SO much praise for Andy Kubert’s framing and set design in the Man-Bat fight scene in the comic art museum. This is how we use comics as a visual medium: make your scene colorfully dynamic and full of life! That’s how you make something entertaining; it’s a comic!! Why aren’t we always throwing out fun gimmicks like this? Man-Bats with katanas and AK-47s… PLEASE. Here’s an interlude to praise Ryan Benjamin, Joe Bennett, Giuseppe Camuncoli, Tony Daniel, John Van Fleet, Lee Garbett, Keith Giffin, JH Williams III, and Andy Kubert for their incredible penciling work. There is not a page I can turn to that doesn’t have a brilliant voice dripping with style and substance.“The victory is in the preparation.”And as we start cutting into the true center of the book, the three ghosts leading into the Black Glove arc, this run truly ascends above everything that comes after. Once again, I am blown away at how incredible original it all is, and how everything Batman comic after was in fact only a pale imitation of Morrison the whole time. Scott Snyder and Tom King have very similar approaches and cadences to Batman, but Grant Morrison did it first with oceans more punch and heart. Why does Batman have to be an asshole to the people he loves EVERYWHERE else but this comic? I feel like we get very little of Bruce Wayne's day to day interactions with the Bat Family, and he still felt like a character you actually like here. Bruce doesn't need to be told to tell Tim how important he is; he just realizes he was being headstrong and does it immediately. A hero!The paranoia Batman deals with as the Black Glove closes their grip actively raised by heart rate, and the monstrous revelation of Zur En Arrh is an all-timer Batman moment for me. I made the fatal error of leaving before the conclusion and almost ruining all the buildup that came before, and it STILL blew me away. I hate to constantly pit two queens against each other, but I have to throw King under the bus here for nonstop having to remind us that Batman is Batman during his run. Narration is far more common in King’s run so it perhaps makes sense, but it still feels so much more slick when Morrison waits for the very conclusion to let Bruce's inner thoughts rip. Less is more!I got into this run for the excellent Batman and Son storyline I really enjoyed in the movie, and ended up enjoying the Black Glove storyline far more. And compared to everything after, like the often convoluted Court of Owls Snyder run or the drip-fed Bane revelations in the King run, there is not an inch of blubber in this thoroughly entertaining story. Jaw-dropping to see the dialogue, art, and forceful themes over 700 pages. You're telling me there's two more of these? But I want to read it again! I genuinely fear that this will be the final nail in the coffin for Batman comics—how can any other Batman writer reach the heights of Grant Morrison’s world?",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37489721-batman-by-grant-morrison-omnibus-vol-1,Batman by Grant Morrison Omnibus Vol. 1.txt

Punderworld Volume 1,"If you've seen those cute comics of Hades and Persephone that sometimes do the rounds online – this is the first collection of those. Yes, the title is terrible, and not even that applicable, because while there is humour here, it's derived far more from character, reaction faces and the odd pratfall than puns. What I hadn't expected, though, was the serious bits. Given the ongoing vogue for retelling classical legends to point up the raw deal women tend to get in the originals, it's fascinating that Linda Sejic has gone the other way, taking one of the stories where the default reading was that the woman was getting a raw deal, and retelling it as a sweet romance. Thus, Persephone here becomes the overworked, shut-away daughter of a controlling mother, never allowed out to other gods' festivals; Hades, meanwhile, is a shy guy admiring her from afar for centuries, never daring to make a move until well-meaning but brash Zeus appoints himself wingman and lends a hand. And yes, all his initial suggestions do run along familiar lines (""So first, you turn into a bee"").It's an angle I could easily see pissing off both the doctrinaire, and those who were already personally invested in the usual Wuthering Heights-esque interpretation, but its popularity isn't ever so surprising when it has Sejic's reliably winning art to convince the doubters. From the most relatable human microexpressions to the grand mythic panoplies and shows of force, she makes it all look both beautiful and real – which also enables her to blur the boundaries between those categories yet keep any hint of bathos entirely deliberate, as when the Styx gives a watery thumbs-up and it's funny, yes, but still impressive with it. Really, my only complaint is that like too many Image books it's littered with homophones, duplicate words and typos, and could really have done with an editor to buff these entirely unnecessary imperfections out of a generally lovely read.(Edelweiss ARC)",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58155191-punderworld-volume-1,Punderworld Volume 1.txt
"Babyteeth, Vol. 1: Born","5 Nobody can resist a baby StarsNow I understand why my comics-savvy husband suggested and recommended this to me in several occasions. The loving reviews are totally justified.I am sure you are all more familiar than me with the storywriter Cates for his previous works, surely also with the inking, colouring and lettering artists too, so I'll stick to my reaction to the story, which manages to be horror in a very matter-of-fact way, tender and funny at the same time.The story is told in non-linear flashbacks by Sadie to her own son and to all us readers, probably the most unflappable sixteen years old you will ever know, and it develops in some leaps and bounds, the volume ended way too soon for me. She's not only a teen single mom, she's also the mother of the antichrist and you are right to imagine she and her baby will be hunted down by some evil organization (apparently the antichrist gets born on a regular basis on earth).The paranormal and supernatural elements are so far just strokes in the story, not much is explained yet, but we witness some immense power signs from this baby when still in his mother's belly. There is action and blood, fun, a warlock, a hell racoon which is very promising, but for me the winning point is that this, at its very core, is a family story and the attention to the details is what made it so true and believable for me.Sadie just wants to be a good mother, no matter how scared, insecure and unprepared she feels. And no matter how different her baby seems to be, she just LOVES him and literally gives all her body can to make sure he grows healthily. I know how true this imperative is for new mothers. Even without teeth and a demon incarnation, you will bleed trying to nurse your baby...and that will not stop you. The responsibility to keep a baby alive the first weeks is not anyone ever talks about...I think she is incredibly calm and positive despite the situation she is in, very mature for her age. She worries but she takes it all in stride.She could not make it without her family and it's not a family with an easy past, but they are there with her, every step of the way. There is no judgement, no accusation, no shaming. The only moment of doubt (which is not rejection and he only needed some extra explanation) from her father is immediately rescued when he does all he can to save their lives. Her dad is just too good to be true, I wish him on every girl, especially teen mothers. Her sister is described as cold and unfeeling, a force of nature on the wrong side of the law, but she is indeed an incredible big sister and she couldn't be one if she really didn't feel. There is a panel in the story, when Sadie talks about her happy childhood memories, where we see Heather feeding infant Sadie, making her laugh and making sure she does not notice the arguing of their parents...this is the kind of details I was talking about, or when Sadie apologies to her son for using swear words while trying to tell her story.There are just a few things for me to address: I am not sure why the cursing was filtered out considering it is a horror story, I hope more will be shown soon to solidify's Sadie's personality (I am not sure which kind of girl or student she was or why she ever chose that despicable boy) and I do not care for the art, sorry, very personal taste; I think Sadie's father and sister are, so far, better visually characterized than her.Gallery of wonderful and horrific covers at the end of the volume.On to the next volume!",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36398208-babyteeth-vol-1,"Babyteeth, Vol. 1 Born.txt"
Ladycastle,"Princess Aeve has been locked up in a tower for the past six years. She'll only be let out when her father finds a husband for her who hopefully isn't too horrible. Until then, she keeps herself busy with songs, as well as letters to and from the local women, who were all left behind when their husbands, brothers, and sons went adventuring with the king.One lone man, Sir Riddick, comes back to the castle with news that all the men were killed by a dragon and that a monster-attracting curse was cast upon the village. Merinor, who'd been acting as the local blacksmith while her husband was gone, accepts a sword from a lady in a fountain and becomes the new king. She, Princess Aeve, and Sir Riddick try to prepare everyone to face the monsters that will soon be arriving.I found out about this graphic novel while doing a bit of research for a possible grant proposal.Ladycastlegot a Virginia Library Association Graphic Novel Diversity Award honorable mention in 2017. It sounded interesting, so I requested a copy.My description (and the publisher's) makes it sound a bit like this graphic novel has lots of women training to fight and battle monsters. Although there's a little of that, that isn't really what happens. Instead, most of the monster problems are solved in nonviolent ways, much to Sir Riddick's confusion.The publisher's description also makes it sound a bit like the women suddenly realized that the men had done all sorts of useful tasks, once all the men were gone and they had to do those tasks themselves. Uh... That didn't really happen. In fact, the only person in the entire village who actually seemed to miss any of the men was Gwyneff, Princess Aeve's younger sister. From the sounds of things, Merinor got to do a lot more while her husband was gone than when he was around. Yanni, a disabled woman, was kept hidden by her husband and told that she was a drain on resources. Aeve was locked in a tower for years by her own father. Ms. Physik was kept as a slave. The list could go on.There was a funeral, and the characters looked sad for a bit, but I didn't really get the impression that anyone except Gwyneff cared that all those men had died, or even had reason to care. And honestly, Gwyneff's anger at being the only upset person was somehow more annoying than anything. You'd think this town would have had at least one decent guy worth mourning. Or heck, one male child.Werethere any children, aside from Gwyneff?It was kind of fun trying to match the snippets of song lyrics throughout the volume to the tunes they were supposed to be sung to (the ones I knew without having to do some googling:Beauty and the Beast's ""Little Town"" and ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air""), and the solutions to the various monster problems were creative. That said, my overall feelings forLadycastlewere only so-so.All of the characters felt like cardboard, even Aeve, Merinor, and Gwyneff - if those three felt fleshed out at all, it was only because everyone else was so flat. The volume dug into Gwyneff and Aeve's relationship a little, as well as their relationship with their stepmother, but it was just scratching the surface. Same with Merinor, her private fears and self-doubt, and her possibly complicated feelings about her husband. And I outright snorted at Sir Riddick's out-of-the-blue epiphany about the negative aspects of chivalry. Was that one little panel supposed to count as character growth?The artwork disappointed me a little too. It didn't look all that bad (I preferred Becca Farrow's art style to Ashley A. Woods'), but the transitions between some of the panels weren't very good. This was most noticeable in Chapter 1. In one scene, Sir Riddick was sitting at one end of the table while Merinor was standing at the other end. The next panel featured a close-up of Riddick saying something stupid and demeaning, and in the panel after that one Merinor was suddenly standing on the table in front of Riddick. I know that she had to have jumped on the table, but the actions weren't communicated as well as they could have been.All in all, this was okay, but it felt like a joke that was stretched out longer than it should have been, starring characters who needed more room to breathe and grow.Extras:A cover gallery.(Original review posted onA Library Girl's Familiar Diversions.)",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466854-ladycastle,Ladycastle.txt
"InSEXts, Vol. 1: Chrysalis","InSEXts had a a lot of great things going for it: A great setting, nasty but appeasing body horror, sexiness, a great central lesbian couple (I was never sure if Lalita was lesbian or bi but still her romance with Mariah is great), and various themes that it tackled. This first volume holds these elements together but sadly slips up in the last issue.The romance between Lalita and Mariah is one of the best things about InSEXts. They love each other so much and see each other as saviors to one another. I found it nice that both of them acknowledged and were okay with William's love toward Lalita and saw no need to get rid of him. William in general was a great character. I love how Marguerite Bennett tackled all the stereotypes of women and race in this series. Such as the ""wandering womb"" scene in the clinic, Lalita's half-Indian Brahmin heritage, and the colonialist and Orientlist views of women's sexuality during the time period. These were done with care and yet pulled no punches when showing how harmful they could be and how women such as Lalita and Mariah could (literally) fight back against them. Overall, the story of InSEXts is how a woman's body can be viewed as horrifying by men, other women, and the woman herself yet how that woman could weaponize her own body under her control.Where InSEXts slips however is with some of its art, storytelling, and the final issue of this volume. For the most part, the art is okay. However, at times the facial expressions are not fully emoting the way they should be during scenes of shock. The clinic scene where Lalita's vagina eats the twisted doctor. The doctor himself looked rather calm despite being dismembered. Other times there was some same face-ness happening between Lalita and Mariah. The final battle in the second to last and last issues is where the artwork plummets. Why does Mariah have dirty blonde hair instead of red hair for such a time. The fight scenes with the Hag wrapping the cynos in her vines and battling Lalita in her ""ultimate form"" are sloppy. I couldn't tell what was going on or how certain characters got to certain positions. At one point William is just looking at the Hag then suddenly he's in her mouth; scenes like these could've benefited from some more fluid transition shots/scenes. Also, where did Elsie come from after they killed the Hag? She just appeared out of nowhere.Also, why do they transform into bug creatures? Did Mariah already have this ability and then gave it to Lalita with the egg in the beginning?Overall, a 3.0 out of 5.0 stars. A good and still thoughtful comic. But the art, pacing, and aspects of the story could use some cleaning up.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31576708-insexts-vol-1,"InSEXts, Vol. 1 Chrysalis.txt"
Delphine,"A young man and woman fall in love while at university but her father’s poor health drives the girl, Delphine, back to her hometown to look after him. The two never meet again but later on the man (he remains nameless throughout) decides to reconnect with Delphine and heads to her isolated small town in the middle of nowhere to catch up and hopefully reconnect. But when he arrives and wanders the empty streets of the town he notices strange people - a ghastly looking man grinning and selling mouldy apples, a funeral attended by witches, an insane cabbie, a creepy man and his demented mother, and a horde of small, ugly men following a ghostly, beautiful woman. Somewhere in this nightmare is his beloved Delphine and he is determined to find her. But will he even escape this town let alone find her...?This might be my favourite out of Richard Sala’s books. I’m a big fan of his work and, aside from (the incredibly hard to find at a reasonable price) “Maniac Killer Strikes Again!”, I’ve read them all and “Delphine” is his best, most solid effort to date. An exploration of fairy tales and their symbolism, this book has the best elements of horror and fairy tales mixed in with Sala’s own unique drawing style and strong storytelling sense. There’s pieces of Hitchcock, Angela Carter, Poe, Charles Perrault, the Brothers Grimm, Hans Christian Anderson, ETA Hoffmann, and Charles Addams throughout this book, returning the original fairy tales of Perrault and Grimm to their dark roots, infusing them with macabre moments of horror.Sala’s choice of a sepia colour palette adds to the suffocating atmosphere of inescapable horror as our hero, ostensibly Prince Charming, goes from one nightmarish scenario to another, escaping a random beating by witches to a terrifying house in the dark forest inhabited by a woodsman with a terrible secret. And as day turns to night, the monsters come out to play and Sala really turns up the terror. Those familiar with fairy tales will recognise Sleeping Beauty, the wicked stepmother, the importance of apples, the dwarves, the woodsman, the frog, etc. and Sala has a wicked time playing with all of these elements to craft a wonderfully gothic horror story.Sala’s work sometimes mixes horror and comedy to produce some entertaining books especially the ones featuring the heroines Judy Grood and Peculia, but in “Delphine” Sala ditches comedy and writes this as straight horror - and succeeds completely. There are so many panels that are genuinely scary, like the funeral during the day - somehow witches and fiends in the daytime is more scary than at night. But at night-time? The haunted mirror in the dark room - wow. That creeped me out big time!“Delphine” is an amazing horror fairy tale written superbly and draw with impeccable skill by one of the most underrated comics creators out there. Fans of horror comics, and comics in general, need to pick up a Richard Sala book immediately - his work is too good not to. But read “Delphine” in particular as it’s a book which showcases his enormous talents at their finest. A remarkable achievement.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14475472-delphine,Delphine.txt
The Ballad of Halo Jones,"This is simply amazing! Literally! It takes an absolutely ordinary character with no real talents or powers and writes her story in such a way that it becomes larger than life. It’s what comic books/graphic novels are really all about, at least from this reader’s point of view. For, at heart, I feel that one of the main reasons why anyone cracks one of these open is to transfer their ordinary life onto the pages of these fantastical illustrations that somehow briefly becomes their own, if but for a moment. Here, the margin from the reality of the average life is narrowed that much more in the character of a regular gal named Halo Jones and in the process becomes more even more accessible in this particular regard. Albeit, far removed in the future with aliens, space travel and technology that is well beyond our own.Overall, Alan Moore is a huge talent whose accomplishments are well known to most of us already. Even those are somehow unfamiliar with his name at this point have at least unknowingly watched a few of the many film adaptations of his work. He’s scary good and much deserving of his reputation. Particularly so in the case of this series, which was abandoned midway and never completed and yet still manages to draw one into it so skillfully that you forgive its few minor faults of silliness as well as the with foreknowledge that you there is no real resolution or ending to it.Although this leading us down a path to nowhere is an unforgivable crime, how this came about is completely understandable, as well as just another reason why Moore is so beloved. It’s his integrity and status as an underground champion that is at the heart of the matter here. You see, the company that originally issued these books had sole rights to all stories and characters that Moore created and in protest he stopped work on this project until a new contract more in his favor could be negotiated. All of us are still waiting some thirty years later.So, who can really blame him for wanting control and ownership over his own work? For perspective, just think of the early rock ‘n’ roll and blues artists and how they all lost millions over their brilliant creations in a similar way. Rather than call Moore greedy and unreasonable let’s just agree to find fault with the real culprit and shit all over the publishing company instead, shall we?Subsequently, only three out of a projected five books of this series were ever published before all the trouble with legalities put an end to it all. The saga of the unemployed and unskilled Halo was meant to follow her life from youth to old age. This is something that is by itself is an interesting premise for this genre alone. Sadly, all we have of her story is her life up her mid thirties…but what a ride it is! Also, Ian Gibson’s wonderful black and white illustrations are considered among his best work here as well.The first book of this series merely seems concerned with setting the stage and didn’t necessarily grip me by its story, which I found somewhat meandering and bordering on pointless for all the action that DOES NOT take place here. There’s also the fact that there is an entirely different slang used here that you have to grow accustomed to, as well as the same for the overall foreign environment and setting of this story with all of their futuristic alien names. Rather than explaining it all through some all-knowing narrator, or similar device, Moore just shows us through actions. The back-story flashbacks eventually happen but only in the later books.If you’re like me, acclimating to these things could try ones patience to the point of losing it. Initially, I even thought that this was going to be the one thing I was going to hate of Moore’s but I kept reading it regardless and I’m glad I did. Overall, this author is not necessarily interested in pleasing or accommodating the fickle tastes of the average comic book reader. He seems to write merely to suit himself and if we are willing to follow him I think that this nearly always pays off.Things become much more livelier by the second book and there are some intriguing premises and classic story devices used here that kept my interest. Of course, almost anything would have been an improvement over the first one. Here, near Shakespearean or classic Greek drama of love, betrayal, and something called a rat king are introduced. Also, by this time the jarring and unfamiliar slang starts becoming more understandable and for me even warmly embraced.In book three all the stops are pulled out and this story starts to really take off. Halo enters a complete downward spiral of depression and alcoholism over her lack of direction in life that eventually leads her to the desperation of enlisting in the galactic army. This takes her to some interesting but yet familiar alien territory that one can readily recognize as either extra-terrestrial versions of Vietnam or Korea, take your pick. After some harrowing experiences as a foot soldier Halo has a complete mental breakdown and once she eventually recovers she begrudgingly re-enlists again with no other options available to her. For at this point in her life, this is the only occupation she is fit or qualified for, let alone among the few even available to her.From here on out, the science used here in regards to the concept of time is absolutely spectacular and mind-blowing and the handling of this is just one of the many reasons why Moore is so revered. Moreover, his main characters start to become fleshed out more fully and even the minor ones start to become more interesting as well. Moore’s understanding of a pace of a story is simply masterful here.Of course then it all ends. If I could be so bold as to suppose where some of this may have been heading, I would guess that whatever was in store for us in the next books would have been built around a confusion of reality and fantasy stemming from Halo’s previous mental breakdown. The seeds of this seem to be planted in this last book but beyond this there really is no telling where this story could have gone in the hands of such an incredible artist and sadly we may never know. Overall, I think this is still so good that you’ll find yourself wanting to know exactly how this story DOESN’T end for yourself and I highly recommend that you do with absolutely no reservations.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59710.The_Ballad_of_Halo_Jones,The Ballad of Halo Jones.txt
GloomCookie,"As a huge fan of Disney villains, I first discovered Serena Valentino several years ago when I discovered her novelFairest of All: A Tale of the Wicked Queen, a prequel to the Disney movieSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs, andFairestquickly became one of my favorite novels of all time upon reading it. She has since published several more books that take place in the same universe, effectively creating her own universe in which most (if not all) classic Disney movies seem to coexist. Not too long after becoming a fan of Serena and her writing, I also discovered that she had two series of graphic novels, one titledGloom Cookieand the other titledNightmares & Fairy Tales, but it has taken me a long time to get to start reading them because, as Serena has stated herself, they are now out of print and difficult to find, and I have begun reading theGloom Cookieseries due to having put holds on the books through the interlibrary loan system via the college where I teach. My hope is that I will be able to continue to do this for the entirety of both series because I absolutely love the first volume ofGloom Cookie, and much is left unresolved at the end of this first volume (which collects the first six issues of the series). Serena Valentino is the writer, and Ted Naifeh is the artist, and both the writing and the somewhat Burtonesque art come together to create a wonderful blend of gothic beauty and comedy, and while I know that there is probably almost no chance of this ever happening, I think thatGloom Cookiewould make a great television series. While it may be true that some of the characters, such as the bad gothic poet Vermilion, are simplified and seem to function more as caricatures than fully developed characters, that works well toward the purpose ofGloom Cookie's world, which seems to playfully and affectionately poke fun at and parody gothic culture and gothic art: ""At first he seemed really cool and stuff,"" Lex (the story's lead heroine) explains to her friends as she recounts a date gone wrong with the aforementioned Vermilion. ""He even planned a picnic at the graveyard"" (Valentino 55). Perhaps the most intriguing character is the story's primary villain, Queen Isabella; even though she is spiteful and vengeful, the story frequently hints at the possibility that there is literally more to her than meets the eye, and her slim figure, black attire, and horned head (she can actually be seen on the graphic novel's cover art) all come together in order to remind me a great deal of Maleficent. I, in fact, recently sent Selena a message and told her that, and she said, ""She was an inspiration. I've always loved Maleficent."" (There is even a scene inGloom Cookiethat is definitely intended to be reminiscent of the iconic christening scene from the opening ofSleeping Beauty. Much of the narrative, in fact, seems reminiscent of classic fairy tales.) I also love the anachronisms seen throughout the story; many of the story's elements (such as Pukémon, Icky Martin, The Spice Sluts, and The Backyard Boys seen as posters on characters' bedroom walls) seem to place it in the late 1990s or early 2000s (which is actually when Serena originally penned the story), but other elements (such as Victorian attire and hansoms) seem to place it centuries sooner than that. I absolutely loveGloom Cookie, and there is only one reason why I award it four stars rather than the full five stars: there are several rather annoying errors throughout, such astheirortherebeing placed where it should bethey're,yourbeing placed where it should beyou're, etc., and with part of the story being set in New Orleans, the infamous serial killer Madame Delphine LaLaurie is mentioned, but her name is (perhaps intentionally?) misspelled as MadameLe Lori. As someone who majored in English in college and now teaches it, I cannot help but notice such errors and be (slightly) annoyed by them, but they do little to nothing to take much away from the story. As aforementioned, I adoreGloom Cookieand am really looking forward to reading the second volume.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1641887.GloomCookie,GloomCookie.txt
"Jingle Belle, Volume 1: Naughty & Nice","Paul Dini is an American television producer of animated cartoons. He is best known as a producer and writer for several Warner Bros./DC Comics series, including Star Wars: Ewoks, Tiny Toon Adventures, Batman: The Animated Series, Superman: The Animated Series, The New Batman/Superman Adventures, Batman Beyond and Duck Dodgers. He also developed and scripted Krypto the Superdog and contributed scripts to Animaniacs (he created Minerva Mink), Freakazoid, Justice League and Justice League Unlimited. After leaving Warner Bros. In early 2004, Dini went on to write and story edit the popular ABC adventure series Lost.Paul Dini was born in New York City. He attended the Stevenson School in Pebble Beach, California on an art scholarship. He attended Emerson College in Boston, where he earned a BFA degree in creative writing. (He also took zoology classes at Harvard University.)During college, he began doing freelance animation scripts for Filmation, and a number of other studios. In 1984, he was hired to work for George Lucas on several of his animation projects.The episodes of the He-Man and the Masters of the Universe cartoon that were written by Dini have become favorites amongst the show's fans over the internet, although despite this as well as contributing to interviews on the released box sets of the series, Dini has made no secret of his distaste for Filmation and the He-Man concept. He also wrote an episode of the Generation One Transformers cartoon series and contributed to various episodes of the Ewoks animated series, several of which included rare appearances from the Empire.In 1989, he was hired at Warner Bros. Animation to work on Tiny Toon Adventures. Later, he moved onto Batman: The Animated Series, where he worked as a writer, producer and editor, later working on Batman Beyond. He continued working with WB animation, working on a number of internal projects, including Krypto the Superdog and Duck Dodgers, until 2004.He has earned five Emmy awards for his animation work. In a related effort, Dini was also the co-author (with Chip Kidd) of Batman Animated, a 1998 non-fiction coffee table book about the animated Batman franchise.Dini has also written several comics stories for DC Comics, including an acclaimed oversized graphic novel series illustrated by painter Alex Ross.

Other books written by Dini for DC have featured his Batman Animated creation Harley Quinn as well as classic characters Superman, Batman, Captain Marvel and Zatanna.Best known among Dini's original creations is Jingle Belle, the rebellious teen-age daughter of Santa Claus. Dini also created Sheriff Ida Red, the super-powered cowgirl star of a series of books set in Dini's mythical town of Mutant, Texas. Perhaps his greatest character contribution is the introduction of Harley Quinn (along with designs by Bruce Timm) on Batman: The Animated Series.In 2001 Dini made a cameo appearance in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back during the scene in which Jay and Silent Bob wear ridiculous looking costumes for a film being directed by Chris Rock, in which Dini says to them ""you guys look pretty bad ass"".In 2006, Dini became the writer for DC Comics' Detective Comics. That same year, he announced that he was writing a hardcover graphic novel starring Zatanna and Black Canary. In 2007, he was announced as the head writer of that company's weekly series, Countdown.

"The Exterminators, Vol. 1: Bug Brothers","This is a far cry from my usual comics reading, which tends toward the traditional (Superman, Batman, other super-heroes, Westerns, war comics, etc.). THE EXTERMINATORS: BUG BROTHERS reprints the first five issues of a relatively new series from Vertigo/DC and centers around the largely dysfunctional lives of the men and women who work for a pest control company in Los Angeles. The narrator is Henry, a recently paroled ex-con whose stepfather owns the company. Unless I missed it, I don’t think the story ever mentions why Henry went to prison, but in this first volume, at least, it doesn’t really matter. He’s an intelligent, flawed, but ultimately likable protagonist. As the story begins, he’s partnered with an exterminator named A.J., who’s just as despicable and repulsive as the vermin they go after. Along the way Henry is also teamed at various times with Stretch, a black Buddhist cowboy, and Kevin, a fundamentalist Christian. There’s also Henry’s girlfriend Laura, who works for the company that makes the poison the exterminators use on roaches.This is more than just a bizarre soap opera, though. It’s also a bizarre scientific/conspiracy thriller, because the vermin encountered by the exterminators are getting steadily larger, more aggressive, and even intelligent, especially the cockroaches. Could the new poison they’re using have some connection? Well, of course it does. Does the evil corporation have some hidden agenda, possibly connected with the government? You know the answer to that as well as I do. But despite those areas of predictability, the script by Simon Oliver (a newcomer to comics; I think this series was his first published work) is funny and well-paced, and he’s created some interesting characters. I like the art by Tony Moore, too, which is easy to follow and suitably grotesque when it needs to be. Overall, I enjoyed THE EXTERMINATORS quite a bit, and I’d certainly read more in the series.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/503309.The_Exterminators_Vol_1,"The Exterminators, Vol. 1 Bug Brothers.txt"
"Harrow County, Vol. 1: Countless Haints","Una historia con tintes oscuros que atrapa desde su primera página.Escogí leer esta novela gráfica por puro impulso, pero me ha sorprendido gratamente.Harrow County guarda un secreto. Aunque sus habitantes simulan que nunca ocurrió nada, lo que le hicieron a Hester Beck está grabado a fuego en su memoria. Hester no era normal, todos creían que era una bruja y decidieron actuar. Ahora, 18 años después, puede que noten las consecuencias de lo que hicieron. Emmy, una joven a punto de cumplir los 18 años, será la que despierte sus temores. Emmy no sabe nada del pasado, pero se verá forzada a descubrirlo y a aprender a sobrevivir...Las primeras ilustraciones son brutales y realmente saben captar la atención.En apenas un par de páginas se asientan bien las bases de la historia y es inevitable querer saber más sobre lo sucedido en el pasado y sobre el presunto vínculo que tiene Emmy con eso. Al ser Emmy la protagonista principal, vamos descubriendo datos y nuevas revelaciones al mismo tiempo que ella, lo cual es un acierto porque así vamos evaluando también su modo de reaccionar.Lo mejor es embarcarse en esta lectura sabiendo lo mínimo posible de la trama, por eso no quiero contar demasiado.Hay brujería, seres sobrenaturales, secretos turbios, gente que no es lo que parece, traiciones, pequeños giros inesperados... vamos, que la trama es muy completita.Si no le doy la máxima puntuación, es solo porque, a pesar de que lo de Emmy está bien desarrollado, lo de Hester sí que solo se ve de refilón. Desde mi punto de vista,explorar mejor todo lo relacionado con ella hubiera ayudado a aumentar la sensación de terrory a sacarle más partido al lado más tenebroso de la novela.El desenlace me dejó satisfecha y, al mismo tiempo, me descolocó.Por cómo fueron los últimos acontecimientos, era imposible que no quedara cierta incertidumbre respecto al futuro de algunos personajes, pero en las últimas dos páginas hay una entrada en escena que no entendí del todo. Supongo que es para que nos centremos en eso en la siguiente entrega, la cual no tardaré en leer.Respecto al tema artístico, el ilustrador explica en un anexo que decidió colorear el libro usando acuarelas, y la verdad es que el resultado es inmejorable. Se usan adecuadamente las sombras, los personajes están bien definidos y las viñetas más sangrientas logran ser inquietantes sin necesidad de recrearse en una violencia que no aporte nada. Además, las expresiones faciles de los personajes también estaban bien trabajadas, era interesante cómo un simple cambio de expresión o de mirada ya permitía percibir que algo siniestro iba a pasar. En resumen,no tengo nada que objetar respecto al trabajo artístico.Pequeña información a tener en cuentaLa edición que leí incluye al final 9 capítulos en formato de texto.Dichos capítulos abarcan apróximadamente la primera mitad de lo mostrado en la novela gráfica. Al parecer, el autor pretendía ir colgando por entregas el libro en su web, pero finalmente decidió contar con un ilustrador y publicar su historia como una novela gráfica. Aún así, y él mismo lo advierte, lo que sucede en esos capítulos no es exactamente igual a lo que se ve en las ilustraciones, así queos animo a que no os los saltéis porque hay cambiosque modifican de manera importante algunos aspectos de la trama.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25486101-harrow-county-vol-1,"Harrow County, Vol. 1 Countless Haints.txt"
"Lady Killer, Volume 1","I'm in love withLady Killer.The Dark Horse comic book with a story by Joëlle Jones & Jamie S. Rich, artwork by Joëlle Jones and colors by Laura Allred debuted in September 2015 and issues #1-5 are bound here, with a sketchbook of character designs and spoof ads. I'm not a comic book buyer because of my literary (and cheapskate) belief that one purchase should equal one story. I don't like getting into a narrative and being told to pop more quarters in the machine. To my pleasure and surprise, this female empowered, action-packed and cheeky volume does contain a beginning, middle and end, along with killer artwork that made me feel alive.The story involves Mrs. Josie Schuller, a housewife and mom of two blonde girls who judging by her proximity to the Century 21 Exposition, lives in Seattle of 1962. As far as her amiable husband Gene and neighbors are concerned, Josie manages the household and volunteers at a hospice. This is a facade for Josie's secret fifteen years running as an contract killer. Demonstrating an aversion to firearms and none for getting bloody, she's fielded contracts and sometimes assisted by a playboy named Peck, who also works for her boss, Mr. Stenholm. When the big boss begins to doubt the little lady's commitment to her work, he decides to have Josie terminated. Bad idea.Lady Killer #1is small but perfect. While the concept of a female killer-for-hire in the suburbs wouldn't have had much agency in the present day, the contrast between the wholesome conformity of the Space Age and the splatter of blood (household stains being a cultural hanging offense in those times) is as playful as it is powerful. Light and darker elements are well-balanced, both in the story and the artwork, which are equally strong and produce an exciting narrative with plenty of forward momentum. The set pieces include a kitchen, a strip club and saving the best for last, the Seattle World's Fair, all unfolding thrillingly and illustrated gorgeously.Rather than make Josie Schuller a sociopath, Joëlle Jones selects a favorite sub-genre of mine: the professional on the job. Nothing about Josie's past or her feelings are stated. Instead, we get to know her by watching her work: She likes using her hands, announcing herself before attack and keeping business separate from home. She dislikes firearms, party guests who can't handle their alcohol and peers with sloppy work ethic. Josie Schuller is a compelling character, using her brain as much as her body to work through problems,workbeing the key word, in an era where there were few opportunities for women to do so outside the hearth.I'd like to seeLady Killer #2find Josie balancing the tedium of running a business with the challenges of keeping the spark in her marriage alive.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23995491-lady-killer-volume-1,"Lady Killer, Volume 1.txt"
"Rachel Rising, Volume 1: The Shadow of Death","9/21/24: Reread for a fall ghosts/liminal space class. Okay, zombies aren't really ghosts, but hey, Rachel rises out of her grave and goes back into her house and after a fashion, reenters her life, after death. Call that what you want to. But I really liked revisiting this and see Terry Moore's great drawing and the sense of humor he brings to what is essentially a horror comic.7/16/18: Third read of this first volume, for summer YA/GN class. Again, when you reread you see how clues are left for you that you can't fully know when you read the first time. There are layers to this comic, too, that a rereading helps you attend to. There's Malus, the presence of the the anti-Christ, demons that move from person to person, murdered girls arising from the dead to avenge themselves, and throughout, there's this low-key humor. Like: humor in the autopsy examination room? How can a risen girl be so glibly funny?! I like Carl, the big goofy sweet mortician, too.7/11/17 Reread for my summer YA comics class with a focus on girls/women. It's not mainly a teen comic, actually, as Rachel and her friends are in their twenties (and as murdered and now risen women, centuries old!), but there are teen women and girls in it, for sure. And it connects well with other witch/zombie/monster comics we are reading, such as Harrow County (Emmy--a witch--rising). I finished the series and very much liked it--great story, great drawing, great characters--so it was interesting to go back and start over. One thing that is clear in this reread: Yes, there are gruesome things that happen, but it is also a very funny comic series. So good! One of the best around of this type of comics.6/18/17 How did I miss this comic when it came out? Here’s how: It looks like a zombie comic (get it, Rachel rising. . . . from the dead?!), and when it came out I was sick to death with the supersaturation of zombie everything. But Rachel Rising is a really good comic about the undead, not really a zombie comic in the popular conception of it, it’s supernatural, it’s horror, it’s a mystery, and it is really engaging, character-based, and amusing. And the story is told from the perspective of the women and girls who had been killed, joining up with living women and girls. Compared to The Walkign Dead where the zombies are just there to be slaughtered.The opening scene is awesome, her rising. Yikes, very spooky and cool. Memorable! And then other things happen, as Rachel re-engages with the world not as creepy zombie walker but as pretty close to what she looked like before; well, yes, undead, and with rope burns around her neck and a very low body temperature! How can she enlist her completely alive family and friends in her efforts to find her killer? She has to convince them she is ""alive,"" first! Some of them thought she just took off for a few days! This part of the world-building is interesting.There’s a scary little murderous girl in it. There’s a really creepy preacher that scares the heck out of you (ok, me) by beginning to help us see what it is that is going on with this other creepy woman who is visiting town (who looks too much like Rachel, which is unnecessarily confusing, a mistake, or is it, not sure?!). Bad things are happening, and a lot of them. But why? And what does it mean that murdered girls are rising from the dead, mad as hell? Is this a book for the #me-too moment? Maybe!This story has murderous vapors swirling everywhere, swirling faster, and they suck you into that vortex entertainingly, through likable, believable characters, and darned good dialogue. It’s not a bloody slasher fest, in case you were worried about that. It feels original and fresh and not cliched at all. I haven’t loved everything that Moore has done that I have read, but this one I really like a lot. It’s fun! And his delicate black and white drawing in this is really amazing.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13555390-rachel-rising-volume-1,"Rachel Rising, Volume 1 The Shadow of Death.txt"
"Crossed, Vol. 1","The Atrocity Exhibition: Garth Ennis and Jacen Burrows Reimagine the Zombie ApocalypseWARNING: This Review Contains Explicit and Disturbing Imagery'Preacher', by writer Garth Ennis, was one of the titles from the 1990's that helped justify the existence of DC's 'mature readers' imprint, Vertigo. In Preacher, Ennis and fellow Brit Steve Dillon created one of the most crazy, violent and shocking comics to be released by a mainstream publisher, taking their popular collaboration on Hellblazer to new levels of outrageous and brutal depravity. Preacher incorporated all the basic elements that editors Karen Berger and Shelly Bond were looking for: contemporary urban fantasy, supernatural entities, a long, 70-or-so-issue story-arc penned by a witty Brit... a faux Neil Gaiman, basically, delivering another 'Sandman', since Gaiman was the only thing related to comics they knew or cared about. But then Ennis turned it all backwards and upside-down and inside-out. There were vampires, but the main vampire and sidekick -- Cassidy -- was very 'Near Dark', and nowhere near Anne Rice. There was a Seraphim fucking a demoness in a romantic corner of the metaphysical DMZ. There was an immortal assassin that heaven called in for acts of trans-nuclear smiting, called 'The Saint of Killers'... similar to a High Plains Drifter/Unforgiven-era Eastwood, he stepped into this bizarre role after a frontier-era killing spree was followed by post-mortem killing-spree in hell, and then a POST-post-mortem killing spree back on earth. There was a super-secret religious order that was immensely powerful, exerting it's irresistible influence over governments around the globe, and dead-set on triggering Armageddon to trot out a new Jesus... or at least the true descendant of Jesus, his bloodline kept 'pure' by way of a 2000-year-old brother-sister incest policy... yielding a smelly, illiterate, microcephalic Jesus so dumb he flings shit like a monkey and drools. In short, Ennis opened a lot of eyes about what comics could and could not do. Writers could embrace the crazy. He showed comic fans that big risks could produce amazing stories, even at 'the big two'. His major area of expertise has always been military history, with a minor in the mythology of the American Frontier. This historical acumen is reinforced by the blackest of black humor, demonstrated both in his classic War Stories: Volume 1 - 2, for Vertigo, and Battlefields, for Dynamite Entertainment.His influence on the current generation of comic writers is profound, and one of the most obvious examples is Robert Kirkman, creator of The Walking Dead. Reading the first couple story arc's, I couldn't help but wonder what Garth Ennis would do with the Zombie Apocalypse premise; as it happened, I didn't have to wait long to find out. Warren Ellis is responsible for first using indie-publisher Avatar's laissez-faire editorial approach to publish the stories that DC had rejected. That worked well enough for all concerned, and attracted an impressive group of foul-mouthed big-name writers, like Kieron Gillen, Jonathan Hickman, and of course, Garth Ennis. There were a few titles of varying quality before Ennis created 'Crossed', but it's clearly the best of his Avatar series... and perhaps his best work in comics. It ignores the Romero-type Zombies of The Walking Dead for a slightly readjusted take on the 'Rabid Dog' Zombie epidemic of 28 Days Later.The diner-scene (Top) - the crazy gets crazier, and the infection takes hold before anyone knows what’s happening. The survivors are forced to hide and scavenge, making plans without any reliable information (Middle). Some effective promotional art by Jacen Burrows (Bottom):Just as many Ennis fans predicted, he is perfectly suited for the kind of story he delivers in 'Crossed', unquestionably the most gut-wrenching, horrifying series ever produced. I've seen over-top-violence and depravity from artists like Johnny Ryan (Prison Pit), ero-guro horror by Shintaro Kago (Anamorphosis) and Suehiro Maruo (Ultra-Gash Inferno), and underground shock-meister S. Clay Wilson. 'Crossed' was more disturbing. Ennis' ability to create convincing and memorable characters, natural, witty dialogue, and a seemingly endless array of terrifying dilemmas remains unrivalled. Crossed is impossible to quit reading, making it a must-have book for horror fans. Although it doesn't have the long-term, epic scope of The Walking Dead, Crossed outdoes Kirkman in every other way. The Crossed themselves are something more credible and terrifying than zombies; there is nothing supernatural about them -- they don't possess the freakish appearance of an animated corpse that is halfway to becoming a skeleton -- but the Crossed are much worse: humans without conscience or mercy, indulging the most sick and brutal whims without fear of consequence.After being infected through exposure to diseased blood or fluids, the newly infected victim has seconds before becoming symptomatic. A raw, bleeding rash running under the eyes and down the nose from just above the brow gives the Crossed their name; once they've turned, new 'vectors' transform into cackling, grinning obscenities driven to rape, torture and kill every uninfected being they come across. Regardless of age, gender or race, each of the Crossed displays the same singular determination to do harm -- mothers murder their infants, children butcher their siblings, and so on. They show no fear and care about themselves only insofar as staying uninjured allows them to kill and/or infect others. Perhaps worst of all, their homicidal insanity does not keep some of them from retaining their ability to operate vehicles and firearms, and they display a demonic intelligence and imagination when it relates to tracking and hunting down prey.This sequence from the first chapter declared war on reader expectations, and the allegorical implications of monsters performing evil under the sign of the cross... in god's name, the sickest of violent crimes become just. It also used the superstitious insanity behind Joel's decision to expose the ridiculous and desperate nature of all spiritual 'faith' (otherwise known as ignorance celebrated as virtue):It's pretty fucked up...You know you'll see something horrible, but it's still difficult to avoid taking that look into the hellmouth.Jacen Burrows, one of Avatar's most popular artists, plays a large role in the book's success. The only consistent weakness in Garth Ennis' projects are the people he chooses to work with, usually friends of his like Steve Dillon, John McCrea, and Carlos Ezquerra, all of whom are mediocre hacks. Jacen Burrows, on the other hand, is a rapidly improving artist, blending North American and European influences in a weird, somehow awkward way that still manages to be appealing... I think he'd be better served with someone other than the garish colorists behind most of the Avatar titles, but it's hard to say. He's not a great artist, by any means, but he does research when he needs to and doesn't rely on the shortcuts and repetition of the deadline-kings. His clean-line style depicts the most heinous atrocities in revolting detail, and his vision of the Crossed and their savage, pitiless expressions of mirth match Ennis' intentions exactly. He understands that human beings are far more terrifying than any monster.One of the factors that continue to differentiate Crossed from the rest of the crowd is the writer's determination to present the reality of such an unbelievably awful catastrophe; there are no sudden heroics, no miraculous escapes, no acts of redemption. And when the worst happens, when the charismatic would-be savior and the innocent children he's trying to protect are cornered, and the most monstrous acts are about to be committed, Ennis refuses to shut the camera down, so to speak, he does not 'cut away'... the would-be savior panics, and attempts to save himself, but fails. The children are tortured and killed.I've been a horror fan for a long time, and I've been fascinated by violence and the ugliest aspects of human nature for as long as I can remember, as if I might inoculate myself with the atrocity exhibition that is our past. But I was still shocked by parts of Crossed, and avoided the sequels that weren't written by Ennis for a while, before hearing positive reviews of the better 'Badlands' story-arcs from respected bastions of criticism like 'The Comics Journal'. This is hardcore survival horror at its most brutal, and I recommend it highly to those who have a strong stomach for this type of story; anyone else should probably skip it.P.S.: I've often asked myself, after reading works like this, what is preferable (in an ethical sense): comics that skillfully create stories and characters in which violence is sickening and shocking, leaving an indelible stain on the reader's mind; or comics in which the reader senses the target on each character's back immediately, using formulaic plots and clichés to an extent that the violence is anticipated, and when the bodies drop there is no shock or lasting memory? In my opinion, Ennis is being ethical even at his most gratuitous, by refusing to let us get comfortable with killing. Violence should never be taken lightly. Stories that do so lie to the reader. Selling bullshit notions of heroism on the battlefield, bloodless deaths, and poignant last words, led to an army of naïve boys who couldn't reconcile the nightmare of the trenches in WWI with the dreams of glorious combat the books of the time inspired.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7720278-crossed-vol-1,"Crossed, Vol. 1.txt"
Tank Girl,"Після анонсу коміксу «Танкістка» Алана Мартіна та Джеймі Г’юлета пройшло вже досить багато часу, що багато поціновувачів мальописів уже не мали надії побачити класику британської коміксової культури українською мовою. Тому, коли проект почав показувати признаки життя, це стало надзвичайно хорошою новиною. А тепер уже навіть тримаю це велико-форматне видання від видавництва Other Comix (імпринт UA Comix якщо що) в руках.Але, що це за видання і чим воно відрізняється від оригінальних коміксів? Ці короткі історії, які мали п’ять і більше сторінок, почали виходити в далекому 1988 році, ще в британському журналі «Deadline», і були чорно-білими. Далі, після того, як ці комікси набули популярності, то були перевидані окремими томами, кожен із яких містив у собі кілька цих коротких історій про екстравагантну Танкістку. І вже через багато років потому, видавництво Titan Comics вирішило ще раз перевидати ці старі комікси, але вже в кольорі, фарбуванням яких займалася колористка Трейсі Бейлі. Так би мовити, «осучаснити» малюнок для нових читачів. І саме таке кольорове видання вийшло друком і в нас українською мовою. Це не є якась нова практика й таку долю спіткало, для прикладу, серії коміксів «Усаґі Йоджімбо» Стена Сакая чи «Ходячі мерці» Роберта Кіркмана.Описати сюжет цих коміксів чи цього тому складно, оскільки в ньому відсутня послідовна сюжетна лінія. Однак головною героїнею завжди є Танкістка, або Ребекка Бак, яка мешкає в постапокаліптичній Австралії, що стала пустелею після природної чи ядерної катастрофи. Світ наповнений кенгуру-мутантами, а вода перебуває в приватній власності. Незважаючи на суворі умови життя, Танкістка не втрачає почуття гумору й не підкоряється владі. У перших кількох випусках першого тому на неї чекають різні пригоди: романтична зустріч із кенгуру, переляк президента через відсутність калоприймача, переслідування небезпечних мисливців за головами, викрадання улюбленого пива, знайомство з дівчиною-реактивницею чи дівчиною-підводницею і заохочення свого кенгуру-бойфренда до боксу. Незважаючи на складнощі, Танкістка виконує різні ролі в цих коміксах: військової, найманки, кур’єрки чи агентки-провокаторки. Вона погоджується на будь-яку роботу, яка добре оплачується, щоб збільшити свій добробут.Основна сутність Танкістки характеризується зухвалістю, неввічливістю та грайливим почуттям гумору. Вона гучна, палить цигарки й дуже імпульсивна. Вона насолоджується випадковими актами насильства й сексу. Вона нічого не продумує, а це означає, що ви ніколи не знаєте, що станеться далі. Єдине, що тут можна назвати стабільним — це те, що вона нікого не слухає. У 1990-х роках це був новаторський комікс із нецензурною, грубою, незалежною та бажаною дівчиною, яка любила друзів і коханого кенгуру. Незважаючи на свої недоліки, Танкістка, безсумнівно, була унікальною у власний спосіб від самого початку. Що і подобалося читачам, адже вони хотіли бути на її місці. Стиль оповіді Алана Мартіна досліджує, як сатиричний гумор, так і скатологічний гумор, тоді як малюнок Джеймі Г’юлетта із часом еволюц��онує від густих, хаотичних мазків до більш прямих й кутастих ліній, які точно впізнають шанувальники його пізніших проектів.Художник Джеймі Г’юлетт надихався британським панк-гуртом The Undertones, і якщо ви не знайомі з ними, можете поцікавитися їхньою творчістю. А вже пізніше став частиною проекту The Gorillaz, британського віртуального музичного гурту, візуальний стиль до кліпів якого багато хто пам’ятає. Малюнок Г’юлетта — дикий, сміливий і дуже деталізований — черпає натхнення, як із панк-культури, так і з Looney Tunes (анімаційний серіал від Warner Bros.). Його власне мистецьке бачення привело його до великої популярності, як і в мальописній царині, так і в музичній.Ось це кольорове видання зображує культурну значущість у британській історії, якої Танкістка досягла із часом. Розпочавшись, як самвидавничий концепт двох студентів коледжу, ця героїня менш, ніж за десять років стала предметом численних антологій. І поміж підлітків Британії здобула великої популярності. Але виникає багато питань чи надалі вона є актуальною для сучасного читача. Тут можна сперечатися довго, але думаю більше ні, аніж так. Та залишається мальованою історією, яку цікаво досліджувати, як і будь-яку класику в мальописах чи інших видах мистецтва, і має мати своє місце на полиці. Це не є збірка, яку візьмеш і прочитаєш за один раз, поринувши в сюжет із головою. Краще виділити кілька днів, де кожного дня прочитаєш дві чи три історії, щоб не перевантажувати себе тим усім безладом, що там відбувається. Одним словом, купуйте та пробуйте. І ще добре, що видавництво вирішило надрукувати цей комікс у великому формату, це дуже допомагає під час читання через велику кількість тексту та дрібних деталей.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/974942.Tank_Girl,Tank Girl.txt
"Baby's in Black: Astrid Kirchherr, Stuart Sutcliffe, and The Beatles","There's no two ways about it: adaptations of non-fictional stories are a tough beast to approach—and doubly so when the non-fictional account revolves about a tragic death. The trick, see, is the fact that anyone who's aware of history, of the story being unveiled, will know how the retelling will end. When we watchedThe Perfect Storm, most of us were well aware that George Clooney and Marky Mark wouldn't make it to the film's credits (save perhaps through some kind of treacle flashback montage). We may know howMilk,Zodiac,Schindler's List, andDownfallend—depending on how aware of twentieth century history and culture played out.So for the sake of the high percentage of those for whom the ending is spoiled years before ever seeing the based-on-a-true story,* authors of stories based on actual historical eventsmustground their narrative on something beyond the typical need to know What Happens Next. If surprise and anticipation are removed from the storytellers' arsenal, they need focus on something outside an envigourating plotline. Certainly, plots are still valuable—most true-to-life stories are interesting because of how they surprise us in their extraordinariness—but that's not all they can rely upon. It's kind of like how thrillers that rely wholly on their game-shifting story twist suffer in terms of rewatchability.Instead, in historical adaptations, we look for things like ambitious character portraits, fascinating authorial technique, cinematic flourish, or some kind of thematic framework to add meaning to the whole enterprise. Maybe even some kind of historical fabrication to change the story's ending entirely (a la Tarantino'sInglourious Basterds). In any case, the author's got to make it so that an audience's knowledge of the finale won't be related at all to the power of the story. So then, what doesBaby's in Blackoffer, being a recountment of the ill-fatedStuart Sutcliffeand the Beatles' time in Hamburg?First an excursis. Because I'm like that.I'm a late-comer to the Beatles party. I hit kindergarten in the late '70s, had a hippie for a father (he still retains the remnant long hair and beard), and was exposed to a fair amount of classic rock. Still, despite understanding that the Beatles were a Big band (like the New Kids, right?), I remained pretty thoroughly unaware of their body of work. By junior high, I had figured out that the Beatles were responsible for ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand."" By high school, when I was waist-deep in Metallica and Motorhead, I had heard stodgy churchgoers—who evidently feared the pernicious influence of rock'n'roll—remark in solemn tones that John Lennon had declared the Beatlesmore popular than Jesus. I had a hard time seeing the I-wanna-hold-your-hand band being in the same league of perniciousness as Motorhead,who sangaboutOrgasmatron, but what did I know.** Finally, in college I heard someSergeant Pepper'swhile working at a restaurant that had the album installed in its jukebox—this was where I discovered that the Beatles did that whole I-am-the-walrus bit.Pitiful, right? In fact, I wasn't to come to realize my interest and enjoyment in the Beatles until a particular videogame was released a little while years back. My wife and I, coming off a couple years of enjoyingGuitar Hero, discoveredRock Bandand enjoyed the division of labours allowed by the game. The only problem was that while I knew most of the songs featured, my wife didn't. Call it a lapse in her education*** or call it serendipity—the result was that when the Beatles edition of the game was released, we jumped on the opportunity because our distinct musical educations filled in each other's gaps. She was a fan and would finally be able to take real joy in theRock Bandexperience. Because it's my way, the day after we first played the game, I spent an afternoon googling all their songs—so that I'd be able to sing along passably well. That led,obviously, to becoming a fan. And that new-found fan's interest led me to read their band's history, as related on Wikipedia.So yes, by the time I picked upBaby's in Black, I was aware of Sutcliffe and Astrid and Klaus and the bare bones of what went on in Hamburg. I was looking for something that would take what I already knew and do something special with it.Baby's in Blacksucceeds wildly.Apart from relating what in many ways is a doleful tale (the book is titled after the Beatles' song, ""Baby's in Black,"" a song about Astrid Kirchherr mourning for the departed Sutcliffe), Arne Bellstorf's adaptation creates a lively mise-en-scene, filled with breathing characters whose lives, dreams, and hopes are affixed to reality without becoming sentimentalized. This last part may be the book's chief charm—that a book principally founded on unfulfilled longing could avoid sentimentalization is mark of distinction. It would have been easy forBaby's in Blackto play to manipulation; that the book remains honest throughout is to Bellstorf's credit.Baby's in Blackis told through Astrid's eyes. It is more her story than Sutcliffe's. And while Sutcliffe may fill the principal male role, as the object of her attentions, John, Paul, George, and Klaus feature only as supporting figures, filling the background and painting a raucous sort of peoplescape over which the story's romance blooms. Pete Best flits through the book almost entirely unseen and Ringo was not yet a part of history. Still, for all these small parts, Bellstorf does well in choosing these sidemen's character moments and gives the reader a sense of who these clowns were during the Hamburg era.[Oh John—you cad.]Visually,Baby's in Blackdevelops its story through wonderful cartooning. The powerful black-and-white drawing helps underscore how indelibly this historical moment will carve itself into Astrid's life. While Sutcliffe admits an affinity for the colour red in his art, Astrid prefers black. For this, it's fitting that her tale should be told without colour—save for an appropriate dash of red text on the book's cover on the US edition.**** Despite the book's cartoony character designs, the figures' simplicity never threatens to diminish the story. Bellstorf conveys almost the whole of the burgeoning romance in a series of looks that pass between the eyes. We are allowed to see so much in such simple line gestures.The writing, translated, functions perfectly. It's always difficult to tell where to pin responsibility for a translated text, but whether on Bellstorf or on his interlocutor, the English version is a success. The words conveyed suit the story, mixing appropriately the melancholy, joviality, and beauty of life. Perhaps the most powerful moment ofBaby's in Blackoccurs in a segment needing no translation, being wholly conveyed through appropriate punctuation.My one struggle with the book, perhaps, is in its choice of text-type for the word balloons. I don't know what was present in the original, but at least in this US edition, dialogue plays out in a sans-serifed font. It's not as unsuitable as a roman font would have been, but it still feels ungainly and unfairly austere. But with such an enjoyable work, this is a single small complaint.I have been previously unaware of Bellstorf's work as a cartoonist, butBaby's in Blackhas made me interested in what other books he may have produced. I have not yet checked, but I hope there are many. And I hope they are even half as enjoyable asBaby's in Black. I can't think of how best to compliment this story, so perhaps this sentiment will suffice: that I want to read more from this creator.Notes* Now that I think about it, this probably goes the same for Nicholas Sparks stories (at least according to popular legend) and movies about dogs (dogs in drama never live and dogs in comedies will probably be injured but narrowly survive).** I also have a hard time seeing how Jesus in 1960 could possibly have been more popular than the Beatles, so it's likely that however great Lennon's hubris, he spoke accurately.*** Says the guy who didn't know the Beatles.**** I prefer the German edition's cover but really do think the First Second edition's use of red is appropriate given some of Sutcliffe's statements about the colour included in the book.________________[Review courtesy ofGood Ok Bad]",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12510887-baby-s-in-black,"Baby's in Black Astrid Kirchherr, Stuart Sutcliffe, and The Beatles.txt"
The Diary of  a Teenage Girl: An Account in Words and Pictures,"TRIGGER WARNINGS: RAPE, GANGRAPE, FORCED DRUG USE, RAPE OF CHILDREN UNDER AGE 18, SUICIDEPLEASE DON'T READ THIS BOOK OR THIS REVIEW IF YOU HAVE A SENSITIVE STOMACH OR HAVE EATEN IN THE LAST FOUR HOURS.THIS REVIEW IS GOING TO BE RIFE WITH SPOILERS, YOU'RE WARNED.This book is a mildly fictionalized version of Gloeckner's real life. I'm just going to spell out what happens here, because trying to pair what happens with my emotion might lead to vomiting and bloodshed. This is how it goes:- Monroe (Minnie's mom's boyfriend, who has raised her since she was 11) starts touching Minnie's breasts. She's 15. He's 35. He's her mom's bf. He keeps telling her she's making him hard and she's curious about having sex so they 'have sex'. (It's really rape, she's 15. Any time I use 'have sex' in quotes I mean 'rape'.)- She's a virgin and he's ""really surprised."" She's 15 and he's raised her since she was 11, so either he's a fucking idiot or he's just pretending like he had no idea she'd be a virgin.-It hurt and it still hurts and I'm sure it was the most colorful blood that will ever come out of me. Afterwards, we lay quietly beside one another on the bed. We both still had our jackets on, naked from just the waist down. I drew an ""X"" on his leg with my blood. He said he couldn't believe I was a virgin.- She picks up a random 16-year-old boy in the park and fucks him in the bushes. Monroe is not really good in bed and he treats her like a child so she's looking for satisfaction elsewhere.- Monroe appears to also have designs on her 13yo little sister.- Minnie starts dating a boy at school named Ricky. He's an asshole. They have sex.- She drinks all the time and is drunk a lot.- She find out her best friend Kimmie goes over to Mr. Cortos' house all the time. He gives her $100 dollars every time she's there. Sometimes she lets him rub her down with suntan oil and grope her.- We meet Pascal, her former stepdad, who's known her since she was 4. He keeps writing mildly sexual things to her and it's fucking creepy. Throughout the whole book we are wondering if he is a fucking creeper or a halfway decent guy. SPOILER ALERT: He's a fucking creeper piece of shit.- Kimmie (the best friend) babysits for a black man who is married to a white woman. He has her give him blowjobs every chance he gets. He wants to fuck her all the time but his cock is too big and she always begs him to just let her suck her off. She sees nothing wrong with this or what she's doing with Mr. Cortos.- Ricky's friend Arnie lies to Minnie in order to trick him into coming over. Then they do drugs together. He wants to have sex with Minnie and tells her Ricky ""gave him permission"" to fuck her whenever he wants. It didn't occur to either boy that she might not agree. She doesn't have sex with Arnie.- She and Kimmie go see their classmate Fred in a mental institution. Fred and Kimmie fuck and Kimmie warns Fred not to have sex with Minnie and asks Minnie not to have sex with Fred. But Minnie doesn't care. She really wants to fuck Fred. They fool around together, but don't have sex because the mental ward is too heavily monitored.- Monroe LOVES listening to her tell stories about all the guys she's fucked. It gets him off.- She starts doing drugs and more alcohol.- Kimmie wants Minnie to come to a motel with the black guy she babysits for so he can fuck both of them. He gives them drugs and alcohol. But they run away before he can have a threesome with them. Remember, he's married with two children.- Monroe hangs out shirtless with Minnie and Kimmie and says sleazoid shit about how pretty they are.- Kimmie starts having sex with another married man named Jay.- Her mom starts dating another man (in addition to Monroe). When that man is nice to Minnie, she thinks he's trying to fuck her. It's only later it occurs to her he might have been trying to be fatherly or big brotherly. She's been conditioned that any man who is nice to you wants sex.-""Jesus, you really like to fuck, don't you?"" he said. His voice was slurry. ""And what about that Kimmie? She really likes to fuck too, doesn't she? What am I going to do with you girls?""Monroe wants to add Minnie's bff to his underage stable. Not to mention he's still making eyes at the 13yo.- Monroe has sex with Minnie and Kimmie at the same time in a big threesome where they all fuck each other. He's so thrilled. He wants to fuck Minnie's other friend, who is a virgin, and he goes after her, but Minnie makes him leave her alone. He says that ever since he's fucked Kimmie and her at the same time he thinks he has a right to sexual access with all her friends.- Monroe still wants to fuck Minnie, but only 'allows' her to suck him off. He won't fuck her anymore. This makes her very sad, but no matter how much she begs for sex, he will only let her suck cock...""What dirty old man like me wouldn't give anything to be fucking a 15-year-old regularly?""...he asked me to suck him off. I asked him to fuck me and he said, ""I thought you'd be satisfied with giving me a blowjob...I kept sobbing... he guided my head towards his lap and I sucked him off, choking and sobbing all the while. I wanted to make love, but after he came he just zipped it back up...- She gets stoned and has sex with John even though she ""hates him"" and ""he's ugly and stupid.""- She has sex with 24-year-old Robert who she met on a phone line.- Her 70-year-old male psychiatrist gives her a vibrator to use and makes her tell him about sex and is super-icky and inappropriate with her, but he doesn't rape her. Ethics mean nothing, no man can be trusted. He knows Monroe is 'having sex' with her and doesn't tell her mom or do anything to stop it.- Minnie goes out with Kimmie, they pretend they are whores and they pick up some men and fuck them. You know, for laughs. As one does.- Everyone has been really warning Minnie away from this lesbian, Tabatha, who she has been eyeing and who is eyeing her. She ignores them.- Monroe punches Minnie in the stomach.- A man tries to pull Minnie into a car at night so he can rape and kill her. He has a gun but she escapes.- Her (shitty) mom finds out Minnie and Monroe have been 'having sex' and demands they get married.- Tabatha takes Minnie to a house full of men. She gets Minnie high/passed-out and all the men rape her. As a reward, Tabatha gets a bottle of drugs. She immediately takes Minnie to another house, forces her to take crystal meth using needles, and then lets another guy rape her.- Minnie is a runaway and living with a gay man in a house where she feels safe because every man there is gay. She continues to use a lot of drugs.- Minnie keeps seeing and having sex with Tabatha even after the gangrape and forced drug use.- Minnie beats the shit out of Tabatha when she catches Tabatha making out with a 14-year-old girl. Then she knocks on a random door and spends the night with a ""compassionate, horny black man"" who has never seen her before in life. They sleep next to each other and she can feel his dick pressing into her but he doesn't rape her so I guess she feels like he's a good person.- Pascal (the ex-stepfather who raised her since age 4) says more creepy shit to her. She finally finds out he's been 'having sex' with her 16-year-old friend Elizabeth. She finally realizes he is a creepy pervert and cuts off all contact with him.- Minnie 'forces' her mother not to bring Monroe to the house anymore, but her mom still dates him and sleeps with him. I guess she didn't think it was a big deal that he was 'having sex' with her 15yo daughter.SO. Let's analyze.This is the sickest, most disgusting book I've ever read. And I've read a lot of disgusting shit. If you want to become celibate, this is a good way to start.There's only two ""good"" (read: not evil) people in the book: Chuck, Minnie's friend from school. He's a pothead skateboarder and even though he offers to be her boyfriend at one point, he never does anything creepy or sexual to her and always treats her kindly. As a result, she is convinced he's gay. Any male who doesn't want to rape her is gay. This is the result of her life experiences. However, Chuck is not a gay man and at the end of the book he and Minnie are still friends.The only other good person is Minnie's little sister, 13yo Gretel. However, Minnie's mom is still seeing Monroe and I can't help but think he'll try to rape Gretel sooner or later. I hope not. The mom is no protection for Gretel and I can't help but think she might be plunged into darkness the same way Minnie was.This book should be included in first-aid kits so that in case someone accidentally ingests poison, this book can be used to induce vomiting. Turn to any page and you will have the urge to vomit. You could also use it as an aid to help give up men. This book purports that no man is safe, none. Even a job in which ethics are important means nothing when you have the opportunity to fuck a 15-year-old. All men are perverts. All men have no morals. The younger the better, right? The only reason a man HASN'T fucked an underage girl is because he's afraid to be caught. Not because, say, he's attracted to grown women and not girls.This book will make you never want to have a daughter. And if you have a daughter and her father dies, you can never date a man again because he will absolutely, positively fuck your 13yo and 15yo daughters in your own house because, you know, men are scum and it's only natural that they'd want some young pussy. This book will make you pray and pray you only have sons.Now. You may think I'm against teenagers being sexual beings. Not at all. I know plenty of people who had first-time sex in high school. However, they had sex in loving relationships with boys roughly their own age. Not grown adult men.Men who want to have sex with 15-year-old girls are fucking perverts. FUCKING PERVERTS. Minnie has no quarter. She's not safe in her own home, the men her mom dates want to fuck her. Her mom's ex-husbands want to fuck her. Her psychiatrist wants to fuck her. Every man on the street she sees wants to fuck her. The men she babysits for want to fuck her. Married, has children, is single, is in a job where ethics are stressed - doesn't matter. All men have no morals and will sleep with any girl who is past the age of first-menstruation. This book is the Warren Jeffs school of thought - if it bleeds it leads. Any girl who has had her first period is ""free game.""And there's no women in here to protect Minnie. You'd think with the all-men-are-amoral-creeps line of thought, there'd be a woman who might look out for Minnie or be outraged at what is happening to her or take steps to protect her in some way. There isn't. There's only her mom and she's horrible. The lesbian Minnie meets sells Minnie to some gangrapists for drugs. Even though women aren't doing the actual raping in the book, they are just as big of creeps as the men in this world.You can only look out for yourself. There's no one who is going to help you or protect you or shield you. EDITED TO ADD: Shedoesfeel safe with her gay male friends. And her gay friend does offer her shelter when she's on the street. Chuck also is a man she's 'safe' with, although that only stretches to 'safe from him raping her' not 'he will protect her.'Even when Minnie KNOWS Monroe has designs on her younger sister, she doesn't do a damn thing about it. He never rapes Gretel in the book, but I'd be interested to see how Minnie would react to that. Unfortunately, I don't think she'd be outraged or disgusted or protective. Instead, I think she'd see it as 'natural' that Monroe would 'want some younger pussy' and probably think the 13yo is capable of making her own decisions.Okay, so even though this book is the most DISGUSTING thing I've ever read IN MY LIFE (considering what I've been reading lately that means a lot) - it's extremely well-written. Gloeckner has an amazing voice and you are exactly in a teenager's head. A smart, creative, fierce teenager's head. It's amazing writing. And since it's all based on Gloeckner's old diaries (you can read that it's pretty much word-for-word because she includes excerpts from her real diaries in the back), Gloeckner must be a pretty amazing person - smart and wildly creative.I feel so bad about what happened to her, though. And I know she doesn't want me to. She doesn't feel any pity for herself or any sadness about what happened to her as a young girl. But I can't help but weep when I think about everything that happened to her. I mean, it's fucking sick. It's about as sick as you can get without including sex with animals, sex with dead bodies, or sex with little girls who haven't hit puberty yet. I mean, we run through everything here: rape, gangrape, forced drug use, etc. etc. And this all takes place within a year's time to a 15-year-old.Tl;dr - Amazing writing. You are truly in the head of a smart and creative teenager who makes sometimes startlingly beautiful observations about the world. On the other hand, this book made me so sick to my stomach I couldn't keep anything down. And I called and canceled the date I had tonight with what could be a perfectly good guy. I just can't stomach looking at or thinking about a man right now, much less allow one to touch me and take me out. Good book to read if you are planning to become a nun, bad book to read if you have a daughter, niece, cousin, sister, granddaughter or any kind of young woman/girl whom you love in life. Might cause you to hate all men. Might cause you to avoid men. Might cause you to distrust men. HIGHLY TRIGGERING for anyone who has suffered rape and abuse.ONE STAR for content. The book is vomit-inducing. Constant vomiting, nonstop, no lulls.

Emily The Strange #3: The Dark Issue,"(Just to let you know, I am going to write the same introduction as I did in my previousEmily the Strangereview because... well... that's how I started with her! XD)Emily the Strange. Man, do we go back. I've been a fan of hers since... well, years! I've always been a fan of the macabre and the grotesque. Anything that's dark and a little spooky. I love it all! I like getting the crap scared out of me so when I discovered Emily a few years back, I was quite glad. I like the weird elements that she brings. I like the oddness to her style, her personality, her mindset. Just the way she handles herself, doing her own thing, inspires me. Sure, not a lot of people get her. They think it's just some ""weird comic"" but that's the whole point to Emily! It's being weird! It's not about making sense or having an actual plot. It's to have fun, get into the bizarre, see the grotesque, yet still be intrigue with what the dark world has to offer. It's amazing and I love Emily for that.This issue's theme is, one of my favorites, darkness! I think this one is one of my favorites because, not only are the short stories and the references amazing, but the artwork, too! (More on that later.) I want to start off by saying how much I love Emily's way of thinking. In this volume, especially, I was able to relate to a lot of what she said. It was incredible. There are two lines especially that she says I always lived by. Felt really close to her then! <3333 Another thing I really enjoyed about this comic was the Edgar Allan Poe spin-off. I love Poe. I love his work. Emily, naturally, is a fan as well and she shows it by paying tribute to him. She also interviewed Marilyn Manson in this issue. One of the best interviews she has done by far! Those two should hang out more often. It'll prove to be quite the fiasco. There's one question Emily asked him about why he thought people played violent video games... his response: Epic! (I would say his answer but this is one of those things you have to read for yourself to fully enjoy it.) One last thing I want to mention: DDR. Dude, DDR! Do you know how long it's been since I've played that!? TOO LONG! I needs me one of them games! XD Don't mind me~ Just fangirling again.Now to the best par of this entire comic: the art. The art was so beautiful! There were two pages that were richly dark! The black the artist used to get the message across was amazing! It adds an element of chills and terror because of how dark it is. They went all out with the art in this book. I am quite pleased. It really draws the reader in with how lovely it looks and the reader stays for how amazing the weird-factor to the stories are. Really, I couldn't ask for a better issue. Read it! Read it! READ IT! You will love it! It's weird, it's fun, it'll make you stare into the darkness long enough to become the darkness! >:3 Okay, I'm just fooling now. But seriously, it's such a fun comic. And it's super short, too. It wouldn't take up your time at all. Give it a try! You might end up likingEmily the Strange. Or at least... the strange part.

It's amazing and I love Emily for that.This issue revolves around the theme of lost... and you certainly will feel lost reading this! XD This is so weird, I love it! Nothing makes sense in this volume! It's all thrown together in a bizarre way yet... I felt like I understood it all! Does that make me lost? I guess it does! X3 Personally, I think this issue was a lot better than the last. The references were EVERYWHERE!!! The first one being a spoof on theWizard of Oz. I love theWizard of Oz! It's one of my favorite books/movies ever to be created! Seeing Emily take a spin on it was just nostalgic to me. Not to mention the cameo of the Prince of Darkness, Ozzy himself! XD That was hilarious! ""Sharon!!!!"" X3333 God, I love reading things that takes what I know and messes with it to no end! Emily did anAlice in Wonderlandreference as well. ""Curiouser and curiouser."" I couldn't stop saying that line for the longest time after I read the book... same thing happened after I read this comic! XP There was also a spoof on Gilligan's Island and Hansel and Gretel. Fairytales, people! Do you know how much I love them! Not to mention all the video game references! Donkey Kong, Mario, Pac-man! Dude, it couldn't get any better than that! (Well, if Sonic appeared, I would have freaked because who doesn't love that blue hedgehog!?) Man, this issue! Ugh! *Fangirls* Yeah... this is not so much a review, huh? I just keep getting sidetracked and going crazy over all the cool stuff without saying anything about the actual issue... oh well! Emily has such a great wit. She made me laugh quite a few times with her snarky comments. Just everything about this girl puts me in a better mood. Who cares if she's a bit twisted? I know I don't!The art is just as amazing as it was in the first volume. With all the black, white, and red, it makes it for a very interesting read. There is a slight difference in this volume, though! They added just a little bit more color! There's some green and yellow but I will let you see for yourself~ Can't give everything away now, can I? Pick this up, readers! It is such a fun read! It's a lot better than the last issue as well! If you like the macabre and the pop-culture references, then you will enjoy this volume just as much as I did. I guarantee it! It is worth the read!

Emily The Strange: Chairman of the Bored,"Emily the Strange. Man, do we go back. I've been a fan of hers since... well, years! I've always been a fan of the macabre and the grotesque. Anything that's dark and a little spooky. I love it all! I like getting the crap scared out of me so when I discovered Emily a few years back, I was quite glad.

It's to have fun, get into the bizarre, see the grotesque, yet still be intrigue with what the dark world has to offer. It's amazing and I love Emily for that.This particular issue centers around the theme of boredom. No matter what Emily does, she can't seem to get out of this boredom. But... that's not going to stop her from trying to find something to entertain her! I love this issue a lot. There were so many references that I got which made me feel that much more involved in what was going on in Emily's strange little world. I enjoyed the part where she interviewed the punk band The Damned. You got to read each members response to her questions. It was a way to get to know them on a more personal level... even if their responses were a bit bizarre. XD Another part I enjoyed was the story centering around getting your head in the clouds. Not only because I am partial to clouds (for obvious reasons) but because Emily was encouraging you to be imaginative. You don't always have to be so serious. Sometimes... daydreaming, imagining something only you can think up of is exciting in and of itself. It doesn't make you any less of a person. The same thing could be said about the plant story. You don't have to ""grow up"" just to live your life. You can do so and ""grow down"" just to please yourself! Others... will only get in the way. This, among many others, is one of the reasons why I love Emily. But wait! There's more! I also liked the spin on the Cinderella fairytale. It was so funny! I enjoy fairytales quite a bit so when I saw how Emily's take on it was... I just laughed! XD Ah, I love this girl.There's really not much else to say except that the artwork is brilliant! It's so richly dark and bright at the same time. Most of it is in black and white and red. Very different from other comics I've read in the past. I thought it was very unique. I can't recommend this comic enough. It's so good. You get pulled in by its weirdness. If you like things that are out of the ordinary and, frankly, doesn't make a lot of sense then I think you will really like this comic. The only reason it gets a four is because I read the other ones and I thought they were slightly better... but that doesn't mean this isn't just as good! It's entertaining and Emily is just so witty. You will have fun with her. Even if she is a bit... odd. <3",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/671428.Emily_The_Strange,Emily The Strange Chairman of the Bored.txt
112 osumaa: Sarjakuvataiteilijan päiväkirja,"Milla Paloniemen 112 osumaa -sarjakuvapäiväkirja vaikutti aluksi ihan kiinnostavalta, mutta kävi hyvin äkkiä puuduttavaksi teiniangstijankkaukseksi (yllätyin, kun kävi ilmi, että päähenkilö on jo 32!). Sarjakuvataiteilija tilittää varmaan melko rehellisesti omaa elämäänsä, ihastumisia ja viinanjuontia. Kun on lukenut kirjan alun, ei loppu oikein tuo mitään uutta. Tällainen keski-ikäinen naisihminen ei enää jaksa innostua itseensä käpertymisestä, känniääliöilyistä, loputtomista ihastumisista tai hyväksynnän kerjäämisestä. Ja tätä aivan loputtomasti, luulin, ettei kirja lopu ikinä.Mikä ehkä eniten tökki, oli se, että tämä kirja meni ""ei mistään"" ""ei mihinkään"". Tarinalla ei juurikaan ollut ""kaarta"", eikä päähenkilökään tuntunut melkein vuoden aikana kehittyvän mihinkään suuntaan. Päällimmäisenä mieleen jäi vain se piirretty angstinaama, jossa suu oli ammollaan hampaita täynnä. Sarjakuvataiteilijan arki näytti koostuvan vain pyhästä kolminaisuudesta ihastumiset - viina - angsti. Olisin kyllä kuvitellut, että taiteilijan arki olisi koostunut myös vaikka ihan työnteosta, mutta sitä ei ollut kovinkaan paljon suodattunut tähän mukaan. Jossain vaiheessa vaan kuvio ihastuminen - tekstiviestittely - kännääminen - treffeily - yhyy miksei se vastaa - ihastuminen - jne vain lakkaa kiinnostamasta.Kohderyhmä varmaan olisi paremmin teiniangstaajat, jotka saattaisivat saada jonkinsortin vertaistukea tästä.Jos tämä olisi ollut selkeästi lyhyempi, olisin ehkä jaksanut antaa enemmän tähtiä.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31425905-112-osumaa,112 osumaa Sarjakuvataiteilijan päiväkirja.txt

Levius/est [レビウス エスト] 1,"Levius is a war orphan MMA arena boxer who's been cybernetically augmented with a special arm. In this case MMA means the sport of mechanical martial arts. Set right after World World I in a sort of alternate history that developed advanced science and medicine. Levius has been taken in by his uncle Zach, with a mysterious past of his own. Together with Bill, a brilliant engineer who keeps Levius' augments working, they hit the MMA federation and get to the highest ranks... but not without opposition. All because the economics of war are too advantageous to certain organizations and they want to use the MMA to ignite the flames of a new war! Levius/est is the next part of the story as Levius deals with the fallout from winning his world altering MMA battle.Things didn’t end happily just because Levius won his battle. However, we see that hope is not lost. Particularly A.J.’s circumstances have changed. The underground facility was quite shocking visually. Zach and Bill have Levius’ future in their hands. I loved how their personalities dictated how they responded, both understanding the other. It’s a beautiful friendship!We meet a new character that rivals Hugo for most extreme personality! It’s a girl from a Levius and Zach’s past. She makes for a crazy addition to everything going on. A.J. Is like a calm storm to this new girl, I really appreciated their contrast. We also learn more about the new head of Levius’ new gym. They are mega benefitting from that battle of Levius.A.J. is quite important now with Amethyst starting a new war. I really appreciate how she put everything together. She really suits Levius, for this not being a romance story I love the two of them together. I feel like they could be happy eventually. I really want to see that happen.Levius/est vol 1 establishes this theme of sheer willpower. We learn more about the steam power that runs everything in this alternate history. And how Levius and A.J.’s pasts fueled their willpower. It’s also a part of the other characters pasts too. I really love how persevering through the difficulties life brings her is the focus of this series, it’s so true to life. Now I’m anxious how Levius and A.J.’s willpower will play out in this war.

Mobile Suit Gundam WING 1: Endless Waltz: Glory of the Losers,"I grew up watching Gundam Wing as a kid so this anime and manga holds a special place in my heart! Definitely something long time anime/manga fans should consider adding to their collection. So with that said, as much as I love GW this new manga remake could be better.There is a new generation of fans who have never seen or heard of GW and I would LOVE to introduce them, but I don't believe this manga is good enough as it's too short and fast paced; it feels rushed! As much as I love the character Duo, and not trying minimize him, I was surprised at how much focus was on him and not on Heero and then secondly Relena who are...you know...Kinda important.It just quickly glosses over how Heero and Relena meet and doesn't show anything about these two, which is DUMB. You don't really see Heero trying to blend in as a student or Relena's birthday party. You see a watered down flashback- yes, a flashback- of her inviting Heero to her party and his classic response, but it's cheap. Even with Duo, the manga cuts from the present and then does a flashback as to why he's here and how then jumps back to the present. Why couldn't this story just be more linear?Even so, I have committed myself to owning this series as I have been thinking about it since it was first released and because I still love Gundam Wing. It makes a great companion to the anime.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34356953-mobile-suit-gundam-wing-1,Mobile Suit Gundam WING 1 Endless Waltz Glory of the Losers.txt

The Witcher: House of Glass #1,"Oh I liked this. It was dark and gruesome and everything I want from a graphic novel.“Being a Witcher’s like a curse. Well, Almost. By nature we have very few friends. Friends we never take lightly. But sometimes even with friendship...enough is enough. And you just have to walk away.”So begins the mysterious story of The Witcher, who befriends a traveller named Jakob after saving him from a Drowner demon. They travel onwards together through dark and sinister lands while Jakob tells the Witcher that his wife, Marta, was murdered nine years ago by Bruxae vampires and was turned into one herself. She has haunted him ever since. In their travels, they come upon a cursed house known as the House of Glass, where Jakob’s dead wife has been spotted.I have not read The Witcher by Andrzej Sapkowski, seen the TV series The Hexer, or played the video games (I know, what is wrong with me?) and I completely understood what was going on and didn’t feel like I was missing any information or back story.At first I was a bit upset that The Witcher would nothelp Jacok’s wife, Marta, avenge her death by killing Jacok, who we later find out murdered her and is a liar. But when she got her own revenge and used the Hag to kill Jacok I was happy that The Witcher let her get her revenge on her own. I feel like her soul would be more settled that way and the Hag was a truly scary monster.I also enjoyed the sketchbook at the end, which showed the design progression for the cover and various scenes, as well as lithography/sketches from Duncan Fegredo and Stan Sakai.

Harleen (2019) #2,",,Ich mein, all die Normalos träumen hin und wieder davon, verrückt zu spielen. Das Problem ist - wenn die das tun, gibt's kein Zurück mehr.''Harley Quinzels Recherche zu ihrer Studie bezüglich der Heilbarkeit von Soziopathie zentriert sich immer mehr nur um eine einzige Person: den Joker, der ihr mit ihren Bemerkungen Rätsel aufgibt. Ein verrückter Mörder, der von jedem Psychologen von ihr als absolut unbehandelbar angesehen wurde, zeigt ausgerechnet ihr von Zeit zu Zeit ein paar Anzeichen von Menschlichkeit ... und vielleicht sogar romantischem Interesse. Harley weiß, dass das nicht sein darf, und trotzdem geht ihr ,,Mr. J.'' nicht mehr aus dem Kopf. Und als wäre das nicht schon nervenaufreibend genug, erlebt Harvey Dent nach dem Attentat auf ihn eine tiefgreifende Veränderung und bringt so das ganze Justizsystem ins Wanken ...Dieser Mittelteil der dreiteiligen Serie rund um die Hintergrundgeschichte von Harley Quinn hat es in diesem Band genauso in sich wie im ersten. Der düstere, recht minimalistische und auf Figuren konzentrierte Zeichenstil bringt die Tristheit und sich ausbreitende Dunkelheit in der Protagonistin sehr gut hervor, insbesondere da manche von ihnen sehr surreal sind. Nicht nur sehen wir ihre Träume, in denen sie nach und nach eine Verteidigungshaltung gegenüber dem Joker einnimmt, auch sehen wir anhand von symbolischen Zusätzen in einigen Panels, wie sich die Machtverhältnisse zwischen den beiden verschieben. Statt einer professionellen Psychologin im weißen Kittel wird Harley zum Beispiel in der Montur des Jokers dargestellt, angekettet an ihrem Stuhl, während er auf einmal ihren weißen Kittel und ihre Brille trägt. Das mag zwar sehr on the nose sein, ist grafisch jedoch sehr beeindruckend und macht die Manipulationsfähigkeiten des Jokers noch deutlicher. Denn so gefeit Harley mit ihrem Studium eigentlich dagegen sein sollte - irgendwann gibt sie nach, auch wenn ihr das selbst eine riesige Angst einjagt.Daher stellt Harley immer noch eine sehr interessante Hauptfigur dar, an der sehr gut aufgezeigt wird, wie toxische Beziehungen funktionieren bzw. wie das Opfer mit entsprechenden prekären Lebensbedingungen wie Harley dazu geneigt sind, kleinen Zeichen der Zuneigung unglaublich viel Bedeutung beizumessen. Besonders wenn sie von jemandem kommen, der ja so gemeingefährlich und unantastbar sein sollen. Ihre inneren Monologe machen das Ganze noch greifbarer.Ein guter Moment vor dem Spiegel löste ein Lächeln ungezügelter Eitelkeit aus, und ein Gedanke bildete sich schneller, als ich ihn unterdrücken konnte. Er erschien wie Galgenhumor, der dich auf einer Beerdigung überkommt ... unerwünscht, doch unerbittlich ... er konnte nicht Abdrücken, weil ich zu schön war, um zu sterben. Ich war den Rest des Tages angewidert von mir selbst, weil mir so ein Gedanke überhaupt in den Kopf kommen konnte. Und ich ahnte nicht, was noch folgen sollte. Er hatte meine Nächte gestohlen. Meine Tage. Mein Lächeln. Jetzt ... jetzt war mein Herz dran ...Der Joker ist in seinen Intentionen noch immer ein Mysterium, allerdings offenbaren sich langsam seine Pläne hinter seinen Sitzungen mit Harley. Daher wird hier weniger auf seine lustige, denn mehr auf seine charmante und manipulative Art gesetzt, was eine nette Abwechslung ist.Was jedoch am erfreulichsten ist, sind die Entwicklungen in Gotham, die sich parallel zur Geschichte entfalten. Selbstjustiz entfaltet seine Macht, die Polizei ist nicht mehr vertrauenswürdig, und Gothams Weißer Ritter ist gezeichnet von dem Attentat, das auf ihn verübt wurde und nicht zuletzt seinen Vorgängern geschuldet ist, die zu milde im Strafverfahren gegen bestimmte Kriminelle waren. Von daher stürzt sowohl Harley in eine Abwärtsspirale, was ihren Glauben an die Heilbarkeit Gothams angeht, als auch Harvey Dent, der Straftäter härter verurteilen möchte, sich in seine Wut hineinsteigert und in seinem Urteilsvermögen getrübt wird. Daher ergänzen sich beide Handlungsstränge fantastisch, nur um im dritten Band zusammengeführt zu werden.Alles in allem ein toller Zwischenband, der viele Dinge aus dem 1. Band weiterentwickelt und auf den 3. Teil vorbereitet, jedoch ohne ein Filler zu sein. Düster, psychologisch, grafisch ansprechend und ergreifend, verfällt Harley entgegen ihres besseren Wissens dem Joker immer mehr, genauso wie Gotham immer mehr der Selbstjustiz verfällt. Ein gelungenes Psychogramm einer der interessantesten Protagonistinnen/Antagonistinnen des DC Universums und einer Stadt, die von innen verrottet.Gesamtwertung:4,5/5 Punkte",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48639085-harleen-2019-2,Harleen (2019) #2.txt
Harleen (2019) #1,",,Ich ließ den ganzen Bullshit hinter mir und brach in eine glänzende Zukunft auf So ist das wohl, wenn man dem Licht entgegengeht. Man sieht seinen eigenen Schatten nicht mehr.''Dr. Harleen Quinzel hatte es nie einfach in ihrem Leben. Ohne einen festen Plan im Leben und häufig einsam, musste sie sich ihren Weg durch ihr Psychologiestudium erkämpfen und sucht nun fleißig nach Sponsoren für eine Studie. Diese will sie ausgerechnet imArkham Asylumdurchführen, in dem psychisch kranke Schwerstverbrecher für viele Jahre festsitzen. Und dort trifft sie auf den Joker, den gefährlichsten von ihnen allen, und ebnet damit ihren Weg für ihren zukünftigen Platz an seiner Seite als Clownprinzessin ...Hach, es ist wirklich erfrischend, zu dieser düsteren Jahreszeit wieder in die dunklen Abgründe von Gotham City einzutauchen! Und umso schöner und schauriger ist es, dass wir dabei nicht Batman im Vordergrund haben, sondern die Hintergrundgeschichte von Harleen ,,Harley'' Quinzel, die in Sejics Neuinterpretation noch düsterer und verdrehter ist als im ComicMad Love, der erklärte, wie Harley Quinn überhaupt dem Joker verfallen war.Doch währendMad Lovedurch seinen schrillen Zeichenstil und Cartoonishness aus derBatman: Animated Seriesnur an einigen Stellen traurig und düster ist, erscheintHarleen(Band 1) nicht umsonst beim Black Label von DC. Die Panels sind überwiegend dunkel gestaltet und zeigen nicht nur Gotham in all seiner düsteren Dreckigkeit einer Großstadt mit hoher Kriminalitätsrate, sondern fokussieren sich auch viel auf die Mimik der Figuren, die mit Zynismus, Hoffnungslosigkeit und Bösartigkeit durch die Welt gehen, und das zu keinem Zeitpunkt in unrealistischem Maße. Harley selbst hingegen ist trotz einiger Schicksalsschläge motiviert, positiv gestimmt und in ihrer Naivität bereit, Dinge zu hinterfragen und ändern zu wollen. Umso interessanter, diese Harley von vor zwei Jahren zu verfolgen, und dabei die Kommentare und Erzählungen der gegenwärtigen Harley zu führen, die auf diesen Zeitabschnitt ihres Lebens zurückblickt. Normalerweise sind solche ,,Erzählungen aus dem Off'' nicht ganz mein Fall, doch in diesem Fall waren sie sehr stimmig und haben die Panels ergänzt, statt sie unnötig auszuerzählen. Besonders wenn diese symbolträchtig waren oder eher subjektive Wahrnehmungen gezeigt haben, hat das Harleys Erzählstimme umso authentischer gemacht.Sejic hält außerdem so einige Überraschungen auf der Handlungsebene für uns bereit, die zeigen, dass Harley weder ein Dummchen ist, dass im Joker eine Herausforderung sieht, noch, dass sie und der Joker von Anfang an ineinander vernarrt waren. Es ist realistischer und gibt ihrer kranken Beziehung zueinander einen neuen Anstrich. Auch wenn die beiden noch nicht allzu viel Interaktion miteinander hatten, kann man gespannt bleiben auf die nächsten Bände, in denen sich sein Einfluss auf Harley noch eher bemerkbar machen wird als hier.Ein überraschend psychologisches und düsteres Graphic Novel, der sich mit einer der faszinierendsten Frauen Gothams und ihrer kranken Liebe zu dem Clownprinz der Stadt beschäftigt. Schon jetzt überzeugt er durch seine detaillierte Bildgewalt, sein Foreshadowing und seine Charakterzeichnung. Da kann es in den nächsten Bänden nur noch genauso spannend weitergehen! Definitiv etwas für alle, die mal einen erwachseneren Anstrich über ihren DC-Charakteren haben möchten.Gesamtwertung:4,5/5 Punkten",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49405512-harleen-2019-1,Harleen (2019) #1.txt
Batman: Last Knight on Earth (2019) #1,"The Future Belongs to the MadAight the ACTUAL end of Snyder’s and Capullo’s Batman run. This has been one of the more well known duos on Batman especially in these past few years. Their names will go down in the future as a classic duo like Loeb and Sale or Miller and Mazzucchelli. BUT either way I was super hyped for this book. Especially when I heard it wasn’t just a regular single issue. It kinda reminds me of when Miller put out 4 bigger sized issues for DKR back in 86. After reading and reviewing this book for a few hours I can safely say I am definitely intrigued. Cuz if there ever was a story that ever left you with 10 thousand questions well here’s a perfect example. The book really does a great job of making you feel like Bruce Wayne. Confused, scared, angry, and clueless. Parts 1&2 of this story are spectacular. Loved the shit out of it. It kinda went down the same route Jeff Lemire took Moon Knight back in 2016. (Which is a fantastic story by the way) Once part 3 hits the book became a little less enjoyable for me for a few reasons.*Spoiler* 1: Since we skip into the far flung future, Snyder sets up what the messed up future would look and feel like. I kinda knew this would happen, but unfortunately this seems very rushed. I really wish this was more than 3 Books because more could have been established and shown about this apocalyptic future. If anybody has ever read myOld Man Loganreview, you know I fucking LOVE when creators make their own crazy and amazing versions of the apocalyptic future. I just find it so damn interesting because so many details and references can be made here. I haven’t read the next 2 books of course but my hunch is that more attention to this won’t be given. Or maybe I’ll totally be eating my own words I dunno. The second problem I have with the second half of the book is the overabundance of EXPOSITION. There is a lot of it here and most of it could have been shown in a flashback instead of in walls of text while 2 characters walk around. Exposition is necessary but you have to do it right, and I know this isn’t the way because I wasn’t engaged, or as engaged as I could have been. The Black Label was something I don’t actually thinking was needed here. They say the word “shit” twice. Even in the New 52 Run there was someone who got stabbed through the eye by Mr. Bloom. And you could see brain, blood, and cartilage. It might get a lot worse but this wasn’t anything that warranted a mature label.Alright Capullo. You have always been one of my favourite Batman artists but this book cements that. The penciling he does here is just………………...Its just too good man. That combined with the colouring and we have some of the best Batman panels I have ever seen. In particular one where he is standing in the rain and another in a super badass straight jacket Batsuit. Damn that was frickin tight.By the way I have no idea where this takes place in continuity. I’d like to believe it’s an elseworlds story, but I’m willing to bet 100 bucks it’s not. With all the fallout after Metal and the current Snyder run on Justice League I have no clue.In the end, I’m in. I really had a great time reading this and it takes Snyder’s and Capullo’s Batman arc to new and batshit crazy lengths. I have a thousand questions that hopefully are gonna be answered soon, a large portion of the book seems to be breezed by, and exposition makes a big crater here but with all that I’m still gonna give a higher grade because overall I got really excited seeing all this unfold. And the art is something to die for.Letter Grade: (B+)",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45029347-batman,Batman Last Knight on Earth (2019) #1.txt
The Joker: His Greatest Jokes,"John Ostrander is an American writer of comic books. He is best known for his work onSuicide Squad,GrimjackandStar Wars: Legacy, series he helped create.Originally an actor in a Chicago theatre company, Ostrander moved into writing comics in 1983. His first published works were stories about the character ""Sargon, Mistress of War"", who appeared the First Comics seriesWarp!, based on a series of plays by that same Chicago theatre company. He is co-creator of the character Grimjack with Timothy Truman, who originally appeared in a back up story in the First Comics title,Starslayer, before going on to appear in his own book, again published by First Comics in the mid 1980s. First Comics ceased publication in 1991, by which time Ostrander was already doing work for other comics companies (his first scripts for DC Comics were published in 1986).Prior to his career in comic books, Ostrander studied theology with the intent of becoming a Catholic priest, but now describes himself as an agnostic. His in-depth explorations of morality were later used in his work writingThe Spectre, a DC Comics series about the manifestation of the wrath of God.

Batman: Damned #1,"Batman: Damned #1 kicks off DC’s new Black Label imprint where fans can see their favourite characters - though it’s mostly Batman - engage in more adult content. Which apparently means full frontal shots of Bruce Wayne’s junk! Yeah, that’s definitely what’s been missing from the main Batman title… and it’s also the sole reason why copies of this issue are going for bonkers money on eBay as DC have said they’ll censor that panel in future printings.The Joker is dead - whodunit? Or more accurately: is he dead - or is Batman dead? The comic opens with Batman shot, bleeding out, then falling off a bridge while his ghostly parents wave at him. He wakes up to the TV news which shows the corpse of the Joker having fallen to his death from the same bridge… hmm…Damned is a very suggestive title, the (ostensibly horror) story is peppered with several of DC’s supernatural characters - John Constantine the Hellblazer, Deadman and Zatanna - and Bruce’s dad flips him a coin, perhaps the fee to pay Charon the ferryman of Hades. Batman doesn’t seem to be himself either and has a breakdown in the Batcave…?It’s a very patchy, vague story. While it’s probable that Batman is somehow in the afterlife and is being guided by an unlikely Virgil, Constantine, it’s not clear why he’s gone to Hell or how solving the mystery of the Joker’s death will do anything. There are numerous flashbacks to Bruce’s childhood where his father Thomas is rewritten as a philanderer and Bruce was apparently haunted by a teenage witch?!But I get why it’s deliberately unfocused: to draw you in (not so much for me), place the reader into Batman’s unbalanced perspective and, most likely, mask what I suspect is a feeble plot - I mean, neither character’s really dead or will stay dead so Brian Azzarello has to play silly buggers to make this feel like less of a waste of time. Still, I didn’t find the story particularly enthralling and Constantine’s narration seemed both pretentious and over-stylised - I think Azzarello was trying for an accent but he can’t replicate Liverpudlian speech convincingly.Lee Bermejo’s art though is faultlessly fan-bloody-tastic! He’s one of my favourite artists and every single page is gorge. I love his Batman, particularly those amazing shit-kicking boots that look so solid, but mostly for capturing the raw physicality of the character - no-one else makes you believe the power within this guy. Damned looks to be set in the same world as Azzarello/Bermejo’s last Batman collaboration, Joker, which featured more realistic takes on DC characters. Zatanna looked sexy as hell as a punky street magician and Deadman was drawn with transparent sinewy red muscles, like something out of a medical textbook, instead of his usual red uniform, which was a really interesting interpretation of his look.This first issue hasn’t totally confirmed to me that this is going to be a great story but I’m mildly intrigued and the comic is readable enough. It certainly benefits from Lee Bermejo’s art which is the star attraction here. Given how good their Joker book was, I’m willing to give these guys the benefit of the doubt but Batman: Damned #1 is still a very mediocre comic. Nevertheless, it’s succeeding in drawing attention to DC Black Label, though unfortunately not for the quality of the storytelling but for the gratuitous nudity!",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41030887-batman,Batman Damned #1.txt
Batman: Harley Quinn,"I'm embracing my inner geek, and loving comics and superheroes (and villains) again!And throughout my chronological quest into the far-reaching spaces of pop culture - coupled with a feminist critique - I can say with upmost confidence that I have rarely encountered a more fascinating, more riotously entertaining, multi-layered and complex female character than Harley Quinn, aka Dr. Harleen Quinzel. Created by Paul Dini and Bruce Timm for 'Batman: The Animated Series' in 1992 as the Joker's henchwoman, she became a definite breakout character, and has grown so much in popularity that DC Comics included her as part of their canon near the end of the millennium.The story of Harley's character conception, and her resulting huge fanbase, is quite remarkable. Because the idea of the Joker - Batman's most famous long-time adversary and one of the top villains in comics - having a female sidekick who also acts as a sort-of girlfriend should never have worked at all. But I think, due to the complexities of the relationship between Harley and the Joker, as well as Harley's infectious and wonderfully mad-capped personality (for a villain), it did work. Splendidly.Plus, can anyone name any other famous clown woman? She's a breath of fresh air (no laughing gas required!) indeed.Harley Quinn, despite what she might show on the outside, is a smart woman. Savvy and quick-thinking. However, her eccentric and overconfident streak got her tragically pulled into a cycle of abuse by the manipulative Joker. She fell madly in love with him when she was his psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum, and would do anything to make him love her just as much, even be his partner in crime. This is despite the fact that the egotistical and sociopathic Joker clearly only loves himself (heck, he shows more affection towards Batman than he does Harley), and uses his obsessive fanatic like a puppet for his schemes. Even if it appears he might love his dearly devoted Harley for real, he would sooner kill her than develop any feelings that to him are a disease, a weakness.Yet even as Harley takes the upper hand on Joker - in revenge for all he has done to her and insisting she is finally over him - she will keep coming back to the Clown Prince of Crime at the slightest gesture of niceness. And nothing changes in this never-ending cycle of destruction.It reveals just how thin the line is between crazy and tragic, and how anyone - regardless of intelligence or background - can become a victim of abuse. It’s one of the things that makes Harley Quinn so tragic and bewitching a figure in popular culture.Well anyway, time for my thoughts on the Harley Quinn DC comic, 'Batman: Harley Quinn', and the ten separate issues contained within it, which all have Harley in the spotlight:1. 'Batman: Harley Quinn #1' - A retelling of Harley's origin, with fairly good artwork that is rich in detail (maybe too much when it comes to women’s bodies =sigh=). Harley can look madly cartoony yet cute and colourful in spite of her dark circumstances. (Awesome cover art by Alex Ross, by the way). It's nice to see her interact with her soon-to-be best friend Poison Ivy as well, who gives Harley a super agility and jumping formula (she doesn't have any powers in the cartoon as far as I can remember). I still prefer her tearjerker 'Mad Love' backstory, however.2. 'Batman: Gotham Knights #14, ""The Bet""' - A cute Harley and Ivy comic strip, with the most cartoony artwork out of the other issues. Nothing special, and nothing makes sense, especially the ending.3. 'Batman: Gotham Knights #30, ""Punchline""' - Heh heh. Very short and contains no dialogue, but subtly demonstrates Harley's morality curveball when it comes to her teasing and playing pranks.4. 'Detective Comics #831, ""Kind of Like Family""' - While I'm not a fan of the more realistic style of artwork, this is a great Harley story. It shows her kicking arse, being a solid negotiator, and able to outwit anyone. Joke's on everyone else; she isn't a dumb blonde, and isn't to be underestimated at any cost. It also shows her sympathetic side towards those who are as lost in life as she is, while she is remorseless towards her enemies whose deaths are on her hands. One of Harley Quinn's first depictions as an anti-heroine.5. 'Detective Comics #837, ""Honor Among Thieves""' - My least favourite of the issues. It seems that any comic I read that involves a reformed Riddler turns incredibly mediocre and just has him be completely inconsequential to his own story/detective case. He kind of disappears to make room for Harley Quinn, who is part of the goddess Athena's women's help shelter here, but surprisingly her role could have been filled by anyone. She doesn't even change into her costume once. I feel you need to have read a vast number of other DC comics at the time in order to understand what is going on, and it doesn't work as a standalone.6. 'Joker's Asylum II: Harley Quinn #1, ""The Most Important Day of The Year”’ - Such fun! My favourite issue in this collection. Harley is determined to rescue the Joker from a mobster gang so she can be with him on Valentine's Day. Funny, clever, and boy can Harley pack an arsenal of weapons!7. 'Batman: Black and White #1, ""Justice is Served""' - A very strange short one. Still, there are some funny moments, Harley’s pet hyenas are in it, and Harley and Ivy together is always a treat.8. 'Batman: Black and White #3, ""Role Models""' - My second favourite, simply because I can relate to the young girl who is a fan of DC's superheroines, including Batgirl. She is kidnapped, then she escapes her abductor and runs into Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy, seeing them as good guys - just as they were going to rob a bank. They end up saving her before Batman can. It’s short, but I love it. The golden-age black and white artwork mirrors the morality complex that Harley has. She does whatever she wants, whenever she wants, and as it turns out, she isn't above saving children from paedophilic creeps. Plus, any Harley story that can work without the Joker appearing in or being mentioned at all is worth the highest praise.9. 'Legends of the Dark Knight 100-Page Super Spectacular #1, ""Dr Quinn's Diagnosis""' - A great concept and interesting angle to approach, with Harley using her background in psychology to try to get into Batman's head and find out his weaknesses. The issue came out in 2014 and I'm surprised no one had thought of this idea before, as far as I know. True, Batman the world's greatest detective outwits the psychotic and lovable clown lady, but the journey is unbeatable. Harley is especially goofy and childlike here, but not necessarily in a bad way.And finally...10. 'Detective Comics #23.2, ""Harley Lives""' – The darkest issue in the collection, rivalling ‘Batman: Harley Quinn #1’. It’s a new take on Harley Quinn, in between her time as a member of the Suicide Squad. She is gothic and brooding here - more like a teenager than a grown woman - and more unhinged; even showing signs of schizophrenia in how she talks to two sides of herself. A deadly sociopath who has no trouble killing innocent people, she's been made into an exact copy of the Joker, only female. I have mixed feelings on this one. It is an introductory character study, with only the beginnings of a plot. But Harley's psychoanalysing narrative, as she tries to justify her actions and way of thinking, is interesting. Her intelligent and insightful side is most prominent. The artwork is fluid and colourful in contrast to the grim, explosive events that happen in the issue, though I really do not like Harley's new revealing outfit (that corset - urgh! It's not even practical for what she does!). It does seem that the more popular a female character is, the less clothing she's left with. Funny, it should have had the opposite effect with how much money she's made and so could afford all kinds of clothes...That's all folks! Cheers for the Clown Queen of Crime and her many interpretations! I can't wait to read more about her in other comics.Final Score: 4/5",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25734020-batman,Batman Harley Quinn.txt
Batman: Rebirth (2016) #1,"The DC Universe Rebirth is a ""2016 relaunch by DC Comics of its entire line of ongoing monthly superhero comic books. Using the end of The New 52 initiative in May 2016 as its launching point, DC Rebirth restored the DC Universe to a form much like that prior to the 'Flashpoint' storyline while still incorporating numerous elements of The New 52, including its continuity."" Many of these titles now have a twice-monthly release schedule and cost about $ 2.99.And yes, I straight-up copied that from Wikipedia, sue me. I have been out of touch from my comics for months now because of other preoccupations. I would do my research better next time, which I did too, particularly about new Bat-writer Tom King himself. The man's a multi-tasker since he's currently writing for DC, Marvel and Vertigo. Before doing Batman, he's written for Grayson and outside of his comics career, he joined the CIA counterterrorism unit after 9-11. So that makes him a badass by default. He had an original superhero graphic novel afterwards, and I suppose that explains why he would be a perfect fit to write Dick Grayson becoming an undercover spy in the aforementioned series, and why he's writing for the flagship Batman title now. King's credentials are pretty damn impressive, so I'm definitely intrigued now to see what he can offer content-wise for his run for Batman. The man interned for Chris Claremont as an assistant writer for X-Men too! Just WOW.ThisRebirthissue is a prologue of some sorts, although most readers might mistake that with the relaunch, issues stamped with Rebirth on different titles meant that there's a continuity here that goes back to the official major story of DC Rebirth. It's not the case, though. Batman: Rebirth is a standalone story much like the others which I think should be the case so that readers who only prefer to read Batsy's adventures and follow them religiously can just focus their energies on this title and other Bat-related titles as oppose to purchasing other titles with Rebirth stamped on it that had nothing to do with the Dark Knight. But I digress.Interestingly enough, this was a collaborative work by Snyder and King. I suppose one can take it as the predecessor passing the torch to the successor symbolically here by writing a collaboration, and in some ways I think it works well. Overall,Rebirthwasn't exactly a stellar standalone. The small moments of dialogue and callbacks to classic roots are what made this issue great, but as a sum of all its other parts,Rebirthjust didn't hold that much weight as a standalone. I liked it for those small moments, though. Such as the dialogue exchange between Bruce Wayne and Lucius Fox because it was funny (thanks to Fox's dry sense of humor and easy comebacks) as well as enlightening (how Fox managed to get Wayne Enterprises back from government control) if not entirely meta (how comics would usually have their billionaire heroes claim back their empires without that much difficulty).Mike Janin's illustrations were invigorating to look at in spite of the darker color palette that made most of its panels muddy and not as polished as one might expect. We don't get to see Batman get into thrilling fight sequences here and instead he faced a singular foe in Calendar Man...who apparently has supernatural powers now? I don't have a problem that his characterization has changed because I believe it at least made him formidable enough, and the concept of him aging as seasons turn (and that means he dies by winter and gets reborn again in spring) was for me brilliant, but I sure hope we get an actual explanation about the sudden shift of his representation in canon. Speaking of characters, we're getting Duke Thomas as the new addition for this series. He's not entirely new, though, so to speak. He first appeared back in Zero Year when the Riddler shut off the power in Gotham City and challenged the citizens to 'get smart or die by natural selection' because as the Riddler, he gets to be an asshole.Zero Yearis hands-down my most favorite story arc from Snyder's run, but even I have to research who Duke Thomas is again because I've forgotten all about him for a moment. What we all need to remember foremost is that Duke Thomas has the worst luck. After that debacle during Zero Year, he had also suffered duringEndgameduring Joker's crazed seige in Gotham. His parents were subjected to the mind-controlling gas. In the meantime, Bruce just offered Duke a place to stay in the mansion while they try to figure out how to reverse the effects of the gas. He also offered him a place by his side as Batman while he fights crime. Duke said he has no interest in becoming the next Robin and even quipped that 'Robin doesn't need a Batman' which is just rude. But Bruce countered that he wasn't offering to train Duke as Robin at all, so way to go on being presumptuous. I for one would like the last Robin to be Damian Wayne, so this is good news. And then Batman showed him a yellow outfit that Duke apparently has to wear now. I'm not sure how to feel about Duke for the time being. I wasn't happy about his snarky comment but I'll give him a pass.The issue ends with Calendar Man being reborn once spring rolled around. So I guess we'll be seeing more of him and hopefully we finally get a reason why he has powers now all of a sudden. Bruce and Duke are training together by kicking trees which I believe is an improvement on subtlety for Bruce who was doing pull-ups on a skyscraper next to the helicopter pad during the first few pages of the issue. I mean, look...I'm a woman who digs Bruce/Batman very much so that piece of fanservice tickled my ovaries, don't get me wrong, but other than that why would Bruce Wayne even do something so exhibitionist which might only call to attention that he is Batman?My best guess is that it was done for the ladies because ladies read Batman comics too, and we totally would appreciate some shirtless superhero acrobatics thrown our way every now and then as we flip the pages.Now was there sarcasm laced within that appreciative statement of my gratitude on behalf of all women for Snyder and King (and Mike Janin most of all) who drew Bruce Wayne in tight black shorts as he hangs suspended on the skyscraper, all sexy perspiration and rippled muscles glistening under the golden sun?

The Joker: A Celebration of 75 Years,"Joker, based on work by Bob Kane, bill Finger and othersEight out of 10There are so many levels to talk about in and about Joker, which seems to be a favorite already for the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role – and indeed, Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing, spectacular, overwhelming as The Joker aka Arthur Fleck.On the basic level, this cinephile and some publications have been less than exultant about the complete motion picture – leaving aside the aforementioned rare, ebullient, marvelous and so complex Joaquin Phoenix one man show – and some would be ready to dismiss it altogether as Much Ado About Little – let us not say nothing.But even if one is tempted to look only at the surface and simplistically say there is not much substance, apart from the troubles of a lunatic that becomes a dangerous killer and the long quest for revenge, an outpouring of violence – hence the R rating – which does not seem all that different from and superior to other movies.There is also the idea that Joker is not much more than an amalgam made from two Martin Scorsese classics, The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver, and the writer – director Todd Philips (director, producer of The Hangover) accepts the influence, but appears to suggest that ‘it was a specific era of cinema that inspired his take on the classic villain’.The descent into Hades does not come in a flash, but we expect – we are also aware in advance, from the rating and the tremendous the buzz surrounding the film – that things would go downhill quickly, even if at the start, poor Arthur is a victim.Actually, on another level – and as mentioned before, there are some different perspectives, angles from which we could look at the saga of Arthur Fleck – we can see the antihero as a victim, given that he discovers (and the audience with him) that he had been abused in childhood and moreover, his mother had been a bystander, with hindsight, it she could be seen as an accomplice, when the boy was subject to violence, physical and psychological.As a myriad of studies demonstrate, those who have been abused in their tender age, become more than likely to inflict pain and suffering on others, once they become adults – which raises the question of how to look at them, at the issue and more importantly, what to do about it, how to prevent calamities and be reasonable, delicate and cautious…all at the same timeIn the opening scenes, the joker is attacked; some teenagers steal a sign he was pushing, in his costume – by the way, the makeup and the look of the main character are extraordinary and help the exuberant, fantastic actor project such a troubling, Haunting Image – and he makes the mistake of chasing after them, only to be kicked and hurt terribly.Seeing that he is so bruised, Randall, one of the colleagues at the outfit where the antihero works, offers him a gun – one of the parts that seem bizarre (but then, when dealing with a psychopath, all his demeanor must look outré by definition) is the attack on this individual, which seems unmotivated, unless the undersigned has missed so much – and later on, Arthur takes it to a children’s partyThe relationship that Arthur has with his mother – up to the moment when he discovers that the past is not what he thought it was – reminds the viewer of the unforgettable, miraculous Rupert Pupkin – who shouted when he was reviewing his comedy act…’it’s impossible, it’s impossible!’- but when the aspiring comedian is recorded trying on his peculiar, tense, scary, strenuous, outlandish laugh and the humor in a hall, it reaches the show of Murray Franklin aka divine Robert De Niro.The talk show host mocks Arthur and his performance, calling it a Joker, and he would pay dearly for this contempt, later on, when the antihero is invited on the air – which is yet another similarity with Pupkin, who wants to be presented on the show of Jerry Langford aka dark, hostile and impressive Jerry Lewis.When three men start harassing a woman who is travelling in the train, in the subway, the Joker seems to be the only other passenger around and he starts with his by now familiar, grating, haunting, strange, signature laugh, which annoys the attackers to the point where they come to the protagonist and start kicking and hitting him, up to the point where he takes the gun out and starts using it with fervor and apparently gusto.This is one of the scenes where we can perhaps have a hint of the value of the film, the fact that it is more complex than usual, average features, for although the comedian is cornered, it looks like self-defense and indeed, he would be immediately celebrated a s a hero by the public – just as Trump is such a great guy for so many fools – it is still appalling to see him enjoy the violence, immensely…The joker has just broken a record, it has become the highest – grossing R- rated movie (and already at number 13 (!) on the top Rated Movies list, as ranked by the public) with a total of $ 788.1 million at the box office and maybe on the way to at least one Oscar…",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18373355-the-joker,The Joker A Celebration of 75 Years.txt
The Joker: A Visual History of the Clown Prince of Crime,"The Joker: A Visual History of the Crown Prince of Crimeis a visual encyclopedic reference book about the Clown Prince of Crime compiled by Daniel Wallace. It chronicles the Joker's criminal career from his first appearance inBatman #1(1940) to the date of publication (2011).The Joker is portrayed as a criminal mastermind. Introduced as a psychopath with a warped, sadistic sense of humor, the character became a goofy prankster in the late 50s, before returning to his darker roots during the early 70s. As Batman nemesis, the Joker has been part of the vigilante's defining stories, including the murder of Jason Todd – the second Robin, Batman's adopted son, and the paralysis of one of Batman's allies, Barbara Gordon.The Joker: A Visual History of the Crown Prince of Crimeis composed of a myriad of illustrations with chockfull of information from the goofy to his most infamous heinous crimes to date. Not only does it track the criminal career of the Joker and his history throughout the years, it gives spotlight on some of its creators: Bob Kane and Bill Finger, Frank Miller, Gran Morrison, Paul Dini and Bruce Timm, Denny O'Neil and Neal Adams, and Alan Moore.A plethora of images from more than seventy years in comics by comic book artists such as Bob Kane, Bill Finger, Jerry Robinson, Dick Sprang, Grant Morrison, Dave McKean, Neil Gaiman, Geoff Johns, Alan Moore, Brian Bolland, Brian Azzarello, Bruce Timm, and Paul Dini. Also included are stills from the various live-action medium, animation, and video game incarnations from Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, and Heath Ledger.Wallace has done a superb job of collecting the most important aspects of the Joker and charts his criminal career extremely well. It is far from exhaustive, but that would take volumes to do, but this tomb is more than adequate for what it sets out to do – to give a visual history of one of the most iconic super-villains.All in all,The Joker: A Visual History of the Clown Prince of Crimewas wonderfully constructed and illustrated reference of the life and times of the most iconic of Batman's Rogue Gallery – the Joker.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10865073-the-joker,The Joker A Visual History of the Clown Prince of Crime.txt
Batman Vampire,"In the midst of the 90s comic book boom after ‘The Death of Superman’, the main names of the two biggest editorials were either submitting themselves to death itself, or simply, changes in their physical stability, that is, a considerable harm was done to them, and someone else will have to take the mantle of the former hero, this allowing writers and artists to constant toying of the brands without the necessity of restarting everything, while offering readers a new set of stories, with different and familiar characters to keep things “fresh”. But, on the other hand, there was an alternative that, in my own opinion, was actually better, and far more interesting than the main editorial plan. Enter DC’s Elseworlds; a collection of stories centered on DC’s household names being put into unconventional situations (for comic book standards) not necessarily belonging to the regular series, placing them in an alternative reality where the current regular continuity doesn’t needed to be respected, or even followed, in fact, it could be set in any time period, any moment in the character’s history, in order to be its own thing completely.Here’s when Batman VS Dracula comes to function. With the creative team of Doug Moench (the creator of ‘Moon Knight’ for Marvel), and artist Kelley Jones, this second volume delivers the ultimate showdown between Batman, and the forces of darkness, incarnated in the shape of blood-sucking vampires, rampaging through the streets of a condemned Gotham, commanded by no other than Dracula himself.Mounch had already demonstrated a specific talent with the supernatural aspect of the superhero genre, with his involvement in series such as ‘Werewolf by Night’, or ‘Moon Knight’, and he previously worked on the Batman series as well, so the character wasn’t new territory for him to explore, but the show stealer in this situation is Kelley Jones as the responsible for the title’s pencils.The whole collection consists of three mega issues, each one narrating a different chapter of the vampire invasion through Gotham. The first one is ‘Batman & Dracula: Red Rain’, where the vampire leader arrives at Gotham, provoking chaos, and mayhem in the lower parts of the city, attacking innocents and turning them into the undead. Batman investigates and reaches the conclusion that the creatures are real, and not only that, but he might also be suffering the vampire curse himself, thanks to a mysterious vampire woman named Tanya, who’s on a quest to put an end to Dracula’s deeds. The second issue is titled ‘Bloodstorm’ where Batman already defeated Dracula, but there’s still an infestation of vampires in Gotham, this time, led by Joker himself, who is using his brand-new vampire army to take down the members of the underworld. The third and final issue is ‘Crimson Mist’, where Batman comes back after killing the Joker, corrupting his own moral code, and succumbing to the vampire curse for good, and now, he rises from the death in order to put an end to Gotham’s worst nightmare: the Batman rogue’s gallery, one by one.It seems the idea of Batman fighting vampires should’ve been exploited in the past- prior to this comic’s release, at least-, but for some reason, it wasn’t until ‘Red Rain’ where the ships finally sailed. As I said, Moench and Jones’ duo works in all the right places; Moench understands the basics of vampire folklore, and his ability to move the story in the best direction is evidently, especially in ‘Bloodstorm’, once we’ve learned that Joker is pulling the vampire’s strings, targeting the crime underbosses to take over. But adding Jones’ art to the mix only improves the situation; Jones has an affinity for the macabre, the gothic and obscure. In a way, he’s perhaps the artist with the creepiest Batman ever put on paper, adding vampires to the catalogue only makes him exploit his visual talents for the best, since this is one of the goriest Batman comic books I’ve ever read. The graphic violence, and sadistic content displayed seems off the charts, with all the twisted imagery, and odd visuals that resemble pulp-magazines, and classic horror comic strips from the 1950s, Jones gives the perfect identity to this terrifying title. His style appears to take strong references from other veteran names, such as Wrightson, or even Mignola, but always putting his own signature to each frame and design.As for the script, Moench could’ve simply crafted an average “superhero vs monster” type of story, with Batman just fighting hordes of undead with a no-brainer depth. Fortunately, the story explores the familiar corners of the Batman classic code: is it crossing the line the moment you start to put down vampires? Isn’t that murder as well? How long can the hero maintain himself pure until the temptation wins? All these questions are explored throughout the length of the three mega-issues, with Moench’s prose which almost resembles a certain Stoker-like style of narrative, which works as a delight the darker the story goes. Also, the this is one of the better takes on Alfred I’ve read in comics, and he’s troubled once his Master is being corrupted by the curse, so that adds plenty to the character’s persona.If I am to complain about a single aspect in this, it could be the rush feeling I got from ‘Crimson Mist’, once Batman is resurrected, and starts taking down one of his main villains at a time, it feels that Moench only wanted to move the story forward without considering the type of climax he’d eventually deliver in the final pages. Also, there are unexplained aspects of the lore from the vampires that aren’t well explained, for example, in ‘Bloodstorm’, Batman acquires a sudden ally, which is a well-known character from his own series; this character is bitten by one of the main vampires in the story, and the kind of powers that character develops variates from your average vampire-reasoning. Also, that character out of nowhere has the power to ease Batman’s thirst, again, without that much of a convincing explanation. I understand why that particular character was in here, I mean, it would’ve been strange if not, but I feel there was a void in the script’s justifications.Other than that, this is exactly what I was hoping for. I’ve heard about this title for quite some time, and I never got the chance to read it until now, and the results are just as good as I thought; frightening, astonishingly illustrated, committed to its own story, and downright a hell of a good time from start to finish.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1347657.Batman_Vampire,Batman Vampire.txt
"The Batman Chronicles, Vol. 1","'The Batman Chronicles' serves to provide fans of the Dark Knight, and of popular culture in general, with a cost-friendly alternative to its counterpart 'Archives' series (which utilises more shiny and colourful print with hard-cover binding) by attempting to distribute every Batman story in chronological order from the character's debut appearance in Detective Comics #27 onwards, using more inexpensive newsprint-style paper withinin soft-cover binding for the trade paperback market.Volume One was published on 30th March 2005, and collects previously released golden-age Batman stories from Detective Comics #27-38 (May 1939 - April 1940) and the entirety of Batman #1, published in the Spring of 1940. What is presented within this volume is a Batman that was conceived as a gun-toting vigilante out to punish the scum of the criminal underworld. Gotham City was yet to be used as the strip's main setting, in stead having the Dark knight travel to Paris, Hungary and New York City in order to embark upon his superheroic missions. The introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder, in Detective Comics #38 gave the young readership a character to relate to, and the 'Sensational Character Find of 1940' has endured throughout to the modern age, in many changing guises, costumes, and identities. However, regarding Batman himself, the man behind the mantle has always been the suave, millionaire playboy Master Bruce Wayne; and in this 1940's incarnation, he is rarely seen without his pipe and tweed jacket. The famous origin story remaining pretty much the same (or thereabouts) over the years is shown in simple fashion, recalling how an un-named gunman (in later issues revealed as Joe Chill) murdered his businessman father and loving mother in cold blood, whilst attempting a routine mugging.The constant supporting character throughout seems to be Police Commissioner James Gordon, a personal friend of Bruce's and a suspicious observer of the Batman and how he is attempting to take the law into his own hands, thereby making the police look redundant at times. Regarding villains however, the Dark Knight seems to have gained quite a few note-worthy nemeses during his first initial outings. These include his first ever arch-nemesis Doctor Death, who uses deathly chemicals as his main arsenal advantage over others, and the enigmatic Mad Monk, who has the power to hypnotise his victims (including Bruce Wayne's then-fiancé Julie Madison) with supernatural abilities, belonging to a family race of vampires and werewolves. It is noteworthy to mention here that these first initial adventures for Batman were later re-worked for the modern audience, following DC Comic's re-vamp of the mid-1980's, which garnered quite positive reviews by its readership at the time. Additional villainous first appearances include that of Hugo Strange, the intellectual mad genius who attempts to turn mental asylum patients into huge 'monsters' in order to rob major city banks, and also the Cat (later known as Catwoman), who uses her feminine wiles and mastery of disguise in an attempt to steal a precious gem from a wealthy old woman. The joker also makes his debut in Batman #1 in two adventures as a delirious mad-man covered head-to-toe in clown attire, attempting to steal precious gems by killing certain wealthy socialites via his famous joker-gas and toxin; thereby setting the stage to become the Batman's most ruthless opponent in almost all of his incarnations throughout history across the DC Multiverse.Later revisions in DC Comics lore would place this golden-age version of the Batman within the setting of Earth-Two, a parallel world where all (or most) of DC's golden age characters reside, later forming the Justice Society of America and going on to fight in World War Two against Hitler and his Nazi henchmen. This version, who initially wore home-made costumes and blue gloves whilst carrying a gun during the late 30s and early 40s, would continue to fight crime as the Batman in his red-sedan car until his retirement and subsequent wedding to the original Catwoman, bearing a daughter named Helena who would later take on the mantle of the Huntress after her mother's death. This golden age Batman, resident of Earth-Two, eventually died following one last battle after coming out of retirement, with the world believing he had contracted lung cancer from his many years of pipe-smoking.Fortunately, his earliest adventures and experimental bat-suits, along with the first bat-gyro, bat-plane and first appearances of the famous batarang and gas-pellet filled utility belt with silken cord, can be seen via this first volume of 'The Batman Chronicles'; charting the mythology of the Batman from the very beginning. With eleven volumes currently in circulation as of November 2013, 'The Batman Chronicles: Volume One' promises to herald an important and vital exploration of the Batman mythos.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/107029.The_Batman_Chronicles_Vol_1,"The Batman Chronicles, Vol. 1.txt"
"Dead Eyes, Volume 1","Dead Eyes was a criminal, a pretty damn successful one if the TV documentary playing over the opening pages is to be believed, but he disappeared in 1997. Speculation about his fate ranges from retirement with the millions he stole, to a murky death, the corpse never discovered. The truth is resolutely mundane: Martin Dobbs is a middle-aged man in a dead end service job caring for his wife Megan, who’s confined to a wheelchair. Gerry Duggan makes it clear from the start that physical restriction hasn’t impaired her mentally, and when Dead Eyes makes a brief comeback she knows. Circumstances dictate, though, that Dead Eyes has to pull another job, and his sudden reappearance awakens the interest of a very powerful man who’s not forgiven being robbed in the nineties.Duggan and John McCrea show how criminal activity during someone’s twenties is a very different proposition from picking up the trade again after a twenty year absence. The senses are dulled, and the reactions are that bit slower. The story told over the opening chapter ensures we realize Martin’s a sympathetic character, but acquired criminal knowledge can only take him so far.Despite being involved with several high profile series, McCrea’s versatility remains under-rated. He’s best known for slightly goofy, comedic pages, but even when working that style his storytelling and mood shines through. Here he’s taking a straightforward noir crime approach, heavy on the black ink even in daylight, and not overselling the comedy. There’s a fair amount of that despite Dead Eyes ostensibly being a realistic, although imaginative, crime story, noting that Duggan’s humour is a dry and bleak form of comedy, and he’s especially resentful about the American healthcare system.Each of the four chapters in this opening volume tells a complete story within a larger tale, supplying some respect for readers who still prefer their individual comics. Anyone who enjoys a sharp crime drama with a few points to make along the way is going to love Dead Eyes.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48933291-dead-eyes-volume-1,"Dead Eyes, Volume 1.txt"
The Prince and the Dressmaker,"""How can someone like me marry a princess? What happens if she discovers who I really am? How could I do that to someone's daughter? How could I do that to my parents?""pg. 73OK, so... I'm not sure where to begin in reviewing this book. I thought it was absolutely ridiculous. First I thought it was ridiculous, but maybe Wang was 'stretching things a little' in order to make a happy, fun message about dressing in drag or defying traditional gender roles or something. But there's 'stretching things a little' and then there's THIS, which borders on absurdist parody. Maybe it is absurdist parody? IDK.I think my main problem here is the setting and tone of the book. I think Wang would have been helped a lot by choosing to place this book in a fantasy setting or a setting removed from the real world. Unfortunately, she places it in 1830s Paris. This is a mistake. The horrible juxtaposition of 'taking things seriously' and 'being utterly ridiculous' is SO jarring and off-putting, I couldn't get over it. Especially the insane, ludicrous ending of this book.There are two ways Wang could really go with this book. She could create a fake world in which this was taking place, amp up the comedy a little, and make a more 'grown-up' version of something likePrincess Princess Ever After. Then, the ludicrous and insane actions of the characters would be seen as 'quirky' and 'uplifting' and 'sending a message of love to all the world!'Or, conversely, she could write a book about a prince in 1830s Paris who enjoys dressing like a woman and then explore what kind of things he'd have to deal with, his problems, his obstacles, the struggles he'd go through especially because he is a prince and not a commoner.Instead, she jams together some kind of 2018 narrative about men who like to wear dresses, and acceptance, and love, and being yourself with a time period when things would NOT have gone down like this. At all. These crossed wires are what is making me despise this book.Let's break it down.Sebastian is a prince. Not of a made-up country! Of Belgium. His big secret is that he loves to wear dresses and other clothing designed for women. He plucks a daring seamstress out of her bad employment situation to work for him at the palace. Blah blah blah. Here are a few of my problems:ONE: Let's start with Frances, the seamstress, making a kind of risqué, modern outfit for a discontented teenage 'lady' who is upset at her mother's attempts to marry her off. It's ridiculous. The girl gets in the outfit and comes to the ball. The whole idea of both Frances being able to make such an outfit and the girl being able to get out of the house in it is RIDICULOUS. Then they all stare at her while she shoves pastries in her mouth.TWO: The idea that Sebastian just moseys around Paris all the time, dressed like a woman. WHAT. WHAT. The book even wants me to believe that Juliana, one of the princesses he 'interviewed' for marriage doesn't recognize him! Yeah. It's incredible, as in 'literally not believable.'Nor does the book really touch upon or describe the real terror I think would accompany these little outings. Even in 1998, they would KILL YOU for being a man trying to 'pass' for a woman. Not that Sebastian is transgender, he's not, but he has to try and 'pass as a woman' because obviously if he didn't things would be much, much worse. Better to let people assume he's a woman than portray yourself as blatantly a man in a dress. WHY? In this book it's because he or his family might be embarrassed. In real life it's because he would be raped and murdered, or tortured and murdered. I was completely gobsmacked. Even in 1990s... more then ONE HUNDRED YEARS AFTER THIS BOOK TAKES PLACE, things were very very bad for queer, gay, transgender, LGBTQIA+ people. I don't know if you remember the nineties. It was BAD.Not like things are so hot now, but... yeah the nineties. >.<However, in this book everyone pretends that the worst thing that could happen to our young prince is that he would be 'outed' and face some embarrassment. He does BAFFLING stuff like goes to a bar alone at night in a dress.Then,a man - Marcel, a prince actually - hits on him in a bar thinking he's a woman. Sebastian is drunk. Nothing sexual happens, but it is revealed that 'Lady Crystallia"" is really Prince Sebastian.Two things: One, no violence ensues. I don't think in 1830 a heterosexual titled man would be understanding about finding out the person he was hitting on in public was male.Second thing, Marcel, like every other character in this book, makes the absolutely baffling and nonsensical decision to publicly humiliate and expose Sebastian instead of sweeping it under the rug. This makes no sense for a plethora of reasons including but not limited to: in doing so, he will expose the fact that he hit on a man sexually. In doing so he will humiliate and devalue his sister. In doing so he will humiliate his own family. In doing so he will be fucking over another royal family which I'm pretty sure he needs to keep good, strong, diplomatic ties with.THREE: Sebastian's parents basically justshake their heads at him and abandon him. WHICH MAKES NO SENSE. He isn't a commoner, he's the fucking prince of Belgium.FOUR:Then he RUNS AWAY and 'no one knows where he is.' The prince. The PRINCE of a European country 'runs away' and I'm supposed to think a.) that this happened and b.) that no one would keep tabs on him. STUPID.FIVE:He goes to practice in a monastery. A monastery. Where he lives as a monk. In some kind of fucking mash-up ofThis is How It Always Is, Batman, and, IDK, The Next Karate Kid. It's LUDICROUS.SIX:Then he's wandering around Paris in monk's robes.Fuck my life.SEVEN: And this is when things really go off the rails. I know, I know, you are thinking ""How could things go MORE off the rails than this?!?!?! Well, let me tell you. They have a fashion show where men come out in drag, but the real crazy-sauce is thatHIS FATHER, THE KING, whips off his royal outfit and dresses in a huge velvet gown and wearing lot of eyeshadow (very 2018 eyeshadow style as well, I must note) struts down the runway.I literally cannot think of a stupider ending to this book, or one that just renders the entire book completely meaningless.You don't have tofight against anything because there literally is nothing to fight against. There are no gender norms in 1830s Paris!!!! The KING and the PRINCE can just easily and casually wear dresses in public and it is all ABSOLUTELY FINE. Love, peace and hugging!What the actual fuck. What was the point of this book then?!!?!? Why didn't she just place it in 2018 if she wanted to write a book that embraces 2018 in every single way except for aesthetics?!!?The dad has absolutely no penchant or desire for wearing dresses, by the way. This is all completely stupid, left field stuff that comes from exactly nowhere, suddenly, like heavy artillery.As the final coup de grâce, I just wanted to say that I did not believe Sebastian and Frances were romantically or sexually interested in each other AT ALL, NOT EVEN IN THE SLIGHTEST, and that this seemed totally wedged in for no reason. I guess we are ALSO supposed to believe that he is going to marry a commoner and a laborer. HA HA HA HA HA HA. His parents are so understanding!His dad even publicly wore a gown for no reason and with absolutely zero social consequences! There are ABSOLUTELY no obstacles to publicly defying gender norms in 1830s Paris.I also was super-annoyed and bothered by Frances's 'fuck my employers' attitude where she seemingly can leave any job at a whim not bothered by, say, HAVING TO EAT FOOD or any practical concerns. It was INSANE. But I've run out of room to rant about this.TL;DR - This book was stupid. Really fucking stupid. I think Wang was going for some kind of promotion of 'love, peace, hugs' and it was hugely jarring considering the subject material and the time period she had chose to insert this subject material into.Why on earth would Wang write a 2018 book with 2018 sensibilities and place it in 1830s Paris. WHY. WHY. It was giving me fits.This book could have been so much better. I'm sad. I see tons of LGBTQIA+ graphic novels coming out now, which is GREAT, the representation is great, but unfortunately this means that (like any other genre or subgenre) as the market is saturated we will get all sorts: good books, mediocre books, and crap. I didn't want this to be crap - I wanted to like it. I can see that other people love it. While I am glad books with characters like this are being published more and more and becoming more and more mainstream, as an INDIVIDUAL who is speaking about an INDIVIDUAL BOOK, I think this book is very dumb. That's my assessment. Can't be helped. I can't pretend to like it just because I am a liberal and the book is spouting liberal ideology. It's honestly one of the stupidest books I've ever read. You can't expect me to take this shit seriously! And I feel like Wang did intend this earnestly.NAMES IN THIS BOOKClementine fSebastian mSophia fFrances fAdelina fImogene fDelilah fEmile mCrystallia mLeroy mJuliana fMarcel mPeter mGeorge mLilian fAurelia fLouise fSir James - horseCaroline f",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34506912-the-prince-and-the-dressmaker,The Prince and the Dressmaker.txt
"Scott Pilgrim, Volume 4: Scott Pilgrim Gets It Together","Fourth Level!This is the fourth book (in a series of six) of “Scott Pilgrim” saga.Creative Team:Creator, writer and illustrator: Bryan Lee O’MalleyPILGRIM’S PATH GOES INCOGNITAAre… are you recording music? You have a home studio?! Oh my god.Do you want something? Can I help you?.Can you record our album? Sex Bob-Omb needs to record an album! We need to take it to the next level! You saw us in play in volume 3, right? We aren’t all that sucky, right?Life is good for good ol Bryan Lee O’Malley (the author, duh!) since we notice improvements in the publishing of this fourth book with 8 opening pages in full color, and the best backcover ever (well, so far in the series) especially if you are fan of the old 8-bit video games!As I guessed while reading the third book (see review), the experience on the fourth was a delicious ""terra incognita"" since many of what you watched in the film adaptation, was used in the original third book, so while certainly is the same evil ex-""boyfriend"" here, the events weren't pictured in the movie version, and along with several other exclusive book events, certainly you'll never know what may happened here, until you read it!Ironically in this fourth book, you’ll get a pretty straight narrative (if you got my pun! Wink, wink! Well, if you don’t anything about the fourth book, maybe you’ll need to read the second section of this review to get the pun, but don’t worry, you’ll reach it soon enough). Anyway, in this fourth volume you won’t get flashback chapters or flashback glimpses, and nothing related to a flashback at all.So, you can say that it’s a volume quite attached to the present…Don’t you just wish this moment could last forever?This moment with your hand on my boob?…Smooth, Scott. Real smooth.Our heroes of the Sex Bob-Omb band are quite busy in this fourth volume…Scott Pilgrim is maturing, gaining a lot of experience points, and now he has a real job! Washin’ dishes in a restaurant, yes I know, but what can you expect with Scott’s resume? NASA?! This is a looney world, but not that looney!Also, Scott is finally leaving Wallace’s nest (not that he would have any choice, but still.) and thanks that he isn’t a jobless loser anymore (oh, no! Now he’s a loser with a job! Big difference!), so Ramona Flowers allow him to move in her house.Stephen Stills is coordinating the record of the Sex Bob-Omb’s first album.And Kim Pine, well, Kim, mmh… let’s just say that beer and misandry is a terrible mix.THE LEAGUE: FOURTH ROUNDYour dreams suck, Pilgrim.Nuh-uh… They’s cool. Like anime.Roxanne “Roxie” Richter, accomplished fine artist, half-ninja, versed in subspace, armed with a ninja sword, kinda chubbier than she used to be in college and the fact that she is a woman isn’t a deterrent to be……the fourth evil ex-boyfriend! I mean girlfriend! I mean ex-girlfriend! Darn it! Evil ex-girlfriend! Geez!Past love life of Ramona was anything but boring! So, she had a phase in college and got a thing for a time with Roxie Richter, and of course now Roxie want to kill Scott. Nothing that shocking in this story.However, in the defiant life of Scott Pilgrim, always there are more than one challenge (at a time!) and his hands will be full (besides of Ramona’s boob, of course) with a mysterious stalker with sword (yes, there will beA LOTof swords in this fourth volume) (nope, I won’t spoil who the mysterious stalker is!) and the return of Lisa Miller (do you remember her? From volume 2 (see that review but don’t see the movie, since she isn’t there) Ha! I knew that she would come back!)) with the dangerous accumulated unfulfilled crush for Scott that will put to the test the still fresh and fragile relationship of Scott & Ramona.About my hunch in the third volume (see that review), well, it wasn’t what I thought. Nope. Not even close. However, I still think that the good ol’ Bryan Lee O’Malley is messing with my mind! Since there is something odd in that secondary (almost tertiary) character and noticing something odd in a world like the one ofScott Pilgrimisn’t cheap talk, so we’ll see (okay, I’ll see!) if there is indeed some hidden surprise about that character.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/744615.Scott_Pilgrim_Volume_4,"Scott Pilgrim, Volume 4 Scott Pilgrim Gets It Together.txt"
"The Mortal Instruments: The Graphic Novel, Vol. 3","Cassandra Clare was born to American parents in Tehran, Iran and spent much of her childhood travelling the world with her family, including one trek through the Himalayas as a toddler where she spent a month living in her father’s backpack. She lived in France, England and Switzerland before she was ten years old.Since her family moved around so much she found familiarity in books and went everywhere with a book under her arm. She spent her high school years in Los Angeles where she used to write stories to amuse her classmates, including an epic novel called “The Beautiful Cassandra” based on a Jane Austen short story of the same name (and which later inspired her current pen name).After college, Cassie lived in Los Angeles and New York where she worked at various entertainment magazines and even some rather suspect tabloids where she reported on Brad and Angelina’s world travels and Britney Spears’ wardrobe malfunctions. She started working on her YA novel, City of Bones, in 2004, inspired by the urban landscape of Manhattan, her favourite city. She turned to writing fantasy fiction full time in 2006 and hopes never to have to write about Paris Hilton again.Cassie’s first professional writing sale was a short story called “The Girl’s Guide to Defeating the Dark Lord” in a Baen anthology of humor fantasy. Cassie hates working at home alone because she always gets distracted by reality TV shows and the antics of her cats, so she usually sets out to write in local coffee shops and restaurants. She likes to work in the company of her friends, who see that she sticks to her deadlines.City of Bones was her first novel.

Champion: The Graphic Novel,"So what happened in the graphic novel was that it covered the major plot points of Champion but it left out all the emotional in betweens needed to make it great. I don't know why they didn't just make this longer. It was only 83 pages long on my ereader and I thought maybe I was miss a part but nope, that was legitimately the whole thing.I loved seeing the art work and putting a picture to a name and seeing certain scenes play out but this definitely could have been soooooooo much better. If I had read this first, I don't think it would have been as emotionally destroyed as I was when I finished the novel this week and that would have been a shame. I would have missed out on the beautiful impact of the story and no one should lose out on that.I would highly suggest reading the entire trilogy in their novel forms before picking up any of the graphic novels cause you really do get a different experience when reading it in this format. I think I've only read Legend and now Champion in this form so I need to grab Prodigy from my library at some point though I’m in no rush right now.Happy reading peepsJo",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31379293-champion,Champion The Graphic Novel.txt
Legend: The Graphic Novel,"4/5 stars.Born into an elite family in one of the Republic's wealthiest districts, fifteen-year-old June is a military prodigy. Born into the slums of the Republic’s Lake Sector, fifteen-year-old Day is the country’s most wanted criminal. But his motives are not as sinister as they often they seem. One day June’s brother is murdered and Day becomes the prime suspect. Now, Day is in a race for his family’s survival, while June tries desperately to avenge her brother’s death. And the two uncover the truth of what has really brought them together and the lengths their country will go to in order to keep its secrets.I was a huge fan of theLegendtrilogy. So, when I saw this at the library I had to pick it up. I usually don't read that many book to graphic novel adaptations but the cover art looked promising. I know you aren't supposed to judge a book by it's cover but I think judging a graphic novel by it's cover is acceptable.This graphic novel was very similar to the book, which I really appreciated. They hit all of the major plot points of the book and even added a couple details that added to the plot. There were quotes in the graphic novel that came straight from the book. The appearance of the characters were spot on. All of these small details just added up and made the reading experience 10x better.The art style wasn't my favorite, it was nice and simple which made the story easy to follow, but it was very stereotypical ""manga"". Granted, that art style is amazing but I don't think it really fit the story it was portraying. The color scheme was very simple and dull, they used lots of greens and browns. This did however compliment the art style and the story.The story was fast paced and easy to follow, even when the fight scenes got a little dicey. There were a couple scenes that were rushed, that could have been drawn out better. But, overall I really enjoyed experiencing the book again. If you want a re-fresher ofLegendthis graphic novel is very loyal to the book and was very enjoyable.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22571758-legend,Legend The Graphic Novel.txt
Joyride Vol. 1,"rep:sapphic mcs, poc charactersGalley provided by the publisher.Joyridetruly was a ride full of joy! Listen, I'll be honest, I was sold from the very first line of the blurb I read & I was sure I'd love this comic book. I was not wrong.The premise is really rather simple. So we are well in the future and the Earth is run by fascists. It's also isolated from the rest of the universe by a barrier called SafeSky & has been for so long, people don't even remember anymore there are stars in the sky. But of course this wouldn't be the great adventure that it is without one of our protagonists who dreams of nothing else but leaving the planet & exploring the stars. Which obviously would be illegal. Has that word ever stopped Uma before though…Naturally Uma isn't alone in her space journey. And here we come to the best part about this book: the wonderful cast! There are three teens from vastly different backgrounds, a robot and an alien. Talk about an interesting crew! They didn't all know each other before but over time and thanks to everything they go through together, they learn to listen to each other & love each other. I'll admit I'm a sucker for the found families trope so this was basically a dream come true for me.Each of the characters is fleshed out and given agenda. And, even more importantly, they are all allowed to make mistakes and learn from them, to grow throughout the story. Their emotions are real, their banter witty & their ideas outrageous. My favorites are definitely mentioned before Uma & the other girl in our space ensemble - Catrin. They both have a complicated past that they're trying to live with and at the same time not let it totally shape them. Honorary mention in my Top Favs category to Bot - the robot who doesn't actually speak a human language and yet remains the cutest & warmest thing in the universe.I think one of the main strengths of Joyride is how fresh & vibrant it feels. This seems to come from two main sources. One: the teen characters truly feel like teens & themselves bring some novelty to the story. It's not exactly common that dialogues written for teenagers come across as natural and something that seventeen-year-olds would actually say butJoyrideexcels at that! And two: the story is so packed with action, with adventures that there's just no way to be bored even for a second. Those two elements also connect beautifully in a way that the plot is driven by teens and they all do things that teenagers would do. I mean, the first place they visit in space is a shopping mall! Come on!I couldn't write a review for a comic book without mentioning the art. The most important part! And OMG it's so incredible???? I absolutely loved all the character designs and the great use of colors. It's honestly a feast for the eyes! It's really hard, at least for me, to find a comic book that has a good plotanda beautiful art so Joyride is a real blessing.My only complaint would be that sometimes there was just too much action. There were a few moments where the cuts between scenes were so rapid, I was wondering if I didn't accidentally miss a page… But overall it's not much of a flaw and doesn't actually take away from the enjoyment of the whole thing.Least butdefinitelynot last! I spy with my gay eye a budding relationship! I really hope it's explored even more in the next volume.All in all, the first volume of Joyride was a great fun! It made me nostalgic for some of my favourite shows, likeCowboy BeboporFireflyand I simply cannot wait to see what else the series has in store! If you enjoy sci-fi stories with amazing characters, especially ones involving actual space travel, you must check outJoyride.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30251383-joyride-vol-1,Joyride Vol. 1.txt
"Skyward, Vol. 1: My Low-G Life","Skyward takes an interesting concept – what would the world be like without gravity? – but it's weighted down by a weak, predictable story and dialogue...and perhaps some tone deafness too.Skyward follows Willa, a teenager with no real character other than teenage tropes: she has a crush and wants to explore the world. Willa was a baby when gravity stopped twenty years ago on “G-Day”; her father is a disgraced scientist who foresaw G-Day. He's now presumed dead, but he's actually unable to leave their Chicago apartment, paralyzed with fear of the outside.A Chicago with no gravity has some interesting elements to be sure – protective ropes and pulleys help keep everyone from drifting off into the sky, meaning certain death; how food delivery works; firearms are now useless, as weapons at least; and the positive effects for those, once considered disabled, who can now get around just as easily as everyone else. The wealthy live on the ground, in magnetic boots and in complete denial; it’s an interesting socioeconomic (and possibly also climate change) commentary that was hinted at but not explored.Unfortunately, Henderson’s writing is full of exposition, unnatural and stilted dialogue that is clearly meant for the reader. Willa’s first conversation is about what gravity was like, which, after 20 years, she's definitely asked before; she tells characters her relationships to them instead of showing us. The villain is cringe-y obvious from the start: Nate’s former partner who’s in it for the profit (conveniently said explicitly), along with overtly menacing visuals. He even has a monologue, and he punches Willa, a teenager, in the face. Multiple times. Even if this is for a YA crowd, it's still lazy writing.While no creators are bound to write characters who exactly match their identity, it’s impossible to ignore that Skyward, with a Black woman protagonist, comes from a team of all men, none of whom (as far as I am aware) identify as Black. Taking place in Chicago, with a socioeconomic commentary, only heightens this disparity. I'm not Black but all sorts of alarm bells for potential tone-deafness are going off.Is it still possible to have a well written story in this case? Of course. But it's also worth asking how Willa's character would be different if she were written by a Black author, specifically a Black woman, especially if this story suggests a socio-economic commentary, and/or a climate justice commentary (and climate inequities more greatly affect people of color). Willa is by far the least developed character in the book, and even though Skyward takes place in Chicago, Nate and Willa are the only people of color in the series so far.Not unlike Paper Girls and many other comics across publishers, it’s strange to see more non-male and non-white protagonists, but still not enough women and people of color actually writing and drawing them.I’m not a fan of Garbett’s art either. He has a very fluid style along with an interesting interpretation of a natural disaster that forms the climax of the first volume. His art definitely carries the final issue as the story continues to be predictable at every turn. But there’s something about the way Garbett draws facial expressions – also fluid but imprecise to the point that often it doesn’t stick the landing. Colorist Antonio Fabela uses wonderful bold colors – especially the purples and yellows when Willa travels to the ground level of Chicago, which reminded me of Batgirl Year One.Skyward was nominated for an Eisner in the Best New Series category, and a film adaptation is in development (with Henderson writing the adapted screenplay) so clearly others enjoyed this story much more than I did. However, I try to still give debut series one more chance; I won’t be terribly excited to pick up volume two, but it might still surprise me.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38812870-skyward-vol-1,"Skyward, Vol. 1 My Low-G Life.txt"

Μιλάει για τις ζωές των γυναικών γεμάτη αγάπη και τρυφερότητα αλλά και ανάγκη να μη χαριστεί στις γυναίκες που δεν δείχνουν να κατανοούν και να σέβονται τις υπόλοιπες.Η μεγάλη επιτυχία της Μαϊτένα έχει να κάνει με την επιλογή της να μιλήσει για την απλή ζωή, τα μικρά καθημερινά γεγονότα που μας κάνουν άλλοτε αντιπροσωπευτικές κι άλλοτε εντελώς μοναδικές γυναίκες. Αν θέλετε να διαβάσετε σαν νερό ένα σχεδόν φεμινιστικό κόμικ βιβλίο, σας προτείνω σίγουρα τα δικά της (βάζω στοίχημα πως και τα υπόλοιπα θα είναι εξαιρετικά). Με τις ιστορίες της Μαϊτένα ένα είναι το σίγουρο: Οι άντρες θα μάθουν πολλά παραπάνω απ’ όσα υπολογίζουν και οι γυναίκες θα νιώσουν ότι δεν είναι μόνες κι ότι όλα λίγο-πολύ βαίνουν καλώς.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2498980.Mujeres_Alteradas_5,Mujeres Alteradas 5.txt
Mujeres alteradas 3,"Dice el refrán que los únicos que nunca cambian son los tontos y los muertos; será por eso que las mujeres se pasan la vida cambiando, alterando lo que haga falta para poder seguir adelante. Tanto trasiego a menudo cansa, y hay días en que una tiene ganas de tirar la toalla, pero ahí están las magníficas historias de Maitena para reivindicar con talento y humor el derecho de todas las mujeres a dudar, a equivocarse, a tropezar una y otra vez con las mismas piedras, para luego seguir caminando con la cabeza bien alta, el cuerpo siempre dispuesto a una nueva aventura y lo más importante - con una sonrisa en los labios.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2498974.Mujeres_alteradas_3,Mujeres alteradas 3.txt
Mujeres Alteradas 2,"6 art panels per page under unifying theme of titlebut only 1.75 x 2.75 inches houses all art and dialogueHer art is good as expressive caricature but it's basic newspaper style simplicity.PERFECT material for a weekly periodical because it makes you think and parry it's philosophy for however long you want to hash it out. If you're social, that is. Sure there are universalities abounding but it's almost completely people² fare.She scribes my type of reading so what took so long between the first two when they're sold easy and cheap? My personal application of Effort Committment. Needing to get IN it to enjoy it- really spoon the cheerios out of her viewpoints.Here's the drill to enjoy Maitena- starting over every page laboriously.->On each page enter a mind-frame based on the title.-->Each panel enter a particular mindset of it's main character.--->Your own mindset about each is summoned, you relate, you identify people, you...many other factors automatically.That gets you through a one sixth of every page. The first takes the longest and the rest are effortless but then you must restart. And get ""stuck"" on certain ones that drive parallel this and that... (I'm done here- spent too much time over too many days to then get deep into this.) and you realize that it needs be spread out to marinate and become succulent instead of truculent.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2498970.Mujeres_Alteradas_2,Mujeres Alteradas 2.txt
Mujeres alteradas 1,"On Sunday, January 15, 2006 I wrote about this book: (I had received this as a surprise from a book online friend)Well this is the funniest rabck I have ever received.And a total surprise. I love it! Thank you so much morsie.Both women on the cover show typical Marlene moods.:-)So yes very appropriate. :)I could not resist reading the first one, even though I was enjoying the book I was reading but it is really laughing out loud material. Great drawings and you recognize so much in the comics of Maitena.Rowena will enjoy them as well. Thank you. HugsUpdate: Well I read this book in 1 hour and had so much fun. Thank you Morsie.

Gender Queer: A Memoir,"I remember when I realized I never had to have children. It was like walking out of a narrow alley into a wide open field. I never have to get married. I never have to date anyone. I don't even have to care about sex. These realizations were like gifts that I gave to myself.pg. 178This is a relatable, well-written memoir by nonbinary author Maia Kobabe.I read it because of all the kerfuffle - this is the number one in banned/challenged books in America right now and I wanted to know why. Reading hysterical accounts of it being 'pornography' online obviously did not answer any of my questions.So I read it, and I found it delightful. Clear, helpful, and written by an author who is relatable.WHY DO YOU KEEP SAYING IT IS RELATABLE, CARMEN? YOU ARE NOT QUEER.Ok, sometimes I doubt these 'conservatives' are actually reading the material they are foaming at the mouth to ban.Yes, this book is an INCREDIBLE and reassuring resource to teenagers (I would say 12 or 13+) who may be struggling with feelings about their gender or maybe worried that they are not sexual enough (Kobabe is asexual). It's SO important to see another person (in this case, Kobabe) wrestling with the same issues, questioning why e doesn't have a strong sex drive, questioning why e feels like neither a boy nor a girl.But honestly, EVERYONE should read this book. EVERYONE. For two reasons.1.) I think one of the big obstacles against the LGBTQIA+ community is straight, cisgendered people not really understanding what any of the letter-soup is. A lot of straight cisgender people might be a bit frightened of LGBTQIA+ people, not understanding them is a huge part of this. The fear and even disgust straight cisgender people may feel when confronted with 'scary queer folk' (especially in the narrative pushed by the right currently, about all non-straight people being pedophiles and etc. etc.) can be ameliorated. IT CAN BE AMELIORATED. It doesn't have to lead to hatred. Simply introducing queer characters into media has helped with this A LOT. Representation matters. Will & Grace. Willow Rosenberg on Buffy. I mean, stuff like the L-Word and Queer As Folk are amazing, but they are not mainstream. I'm more focusing on stuff you didn't have to pay to get. Stuff that you could get on regular, national television. Modern Family. It helps take the mystery away. It helps see a person with a queer identity in a different light for people who may not know any (out) queer people in their daily life.Someone who is not in an urban environment, maybe doesn't personally know any queer people, can pick up this book and say, 'Huh. I read this book and I relate to Kobabe.'Because Kobabe is very relatable. People might agree with eir for a plethora of reasons - even if the reader of this memoir is not queer. How about the fear and discomfort of getting a pap smear? Very relatable for a lot of women, especially young women reading this book who might not have gotten their first pap smear yet. How about Kobabe's amazing confidence in turning down dating/sexual partners who e knows won't work for eir? That's quite inspiring. A lot of young people lack the ability to maturely turn down people who want to date them. Seeing Kobabe practicing healthy boundary-setting and assertive self-protection is a great role model for teens.What about females who simply do NOT want to get married? Women or girls who do NOT want to have children? Straight, cisgendered women get tons of negative feedback for not wanting to get married or have children. Seeing Kobabe come to these decisions for eirself and about eirself is powerful. Sex isn't eir thing. This takes eir a long time to figure out. Readers might be struggling with the dawning realization that they have a low sex drive (doesn't necessarily mean you are asexual, although Kobabe is). This can be scary. Thinking you are a freak because you are uninterested in sex or fantasize about growing up to be the maiden aunt can make a young person feel alone. But tons of people struggle with this stuff. And seeing Kobabe do it is helpful and reassuring.Same thing with Kobabe refusing to shave eir legs or underarms. Or vulva, for that matter. Tons of women are interested in this, but society is BRUTAL in its enforcement of gender roles. Seeing Kobabe (and one of the women e dates) frankly discuss how they both have body hair before engaging in sex, and how that has to be a 'confession' because a female having body hair is SO SHAMEFUL is powerful and really can make teens (or any reader) think critically about how society forces gender expression.There's about 8 more examples of 'totally relatable stuff for readers, even if you are not queer' that I could list here.The book is not at all preachy. Kobabe speaks simply and honestly. You really understand Kobabe and where e is coming from by the end of the book. Kobabe doesn't shy away from troublesome elements. For example, e has a difficult conversation with eir lesbian, feminist aunt who thinks nonbinary and transgender is a form of misogyny. Or the part where Kobabe admits that as a young person, e fantasized about having to have eir breasts removed because of cancer - stating that since then people in eir family have had breast cancer and what a terrible fantasy that was. It's honest, it's reminiscent of a book byJudy Blume. Obviously, this book is aimed at an older audience thanJudy Blume's audience. But the honest, helpful-to-youth, tackling-difficult-issues-without-being-preachy feeling is strong, just like Blume's work.Probably not a coincidence, since Blume's books were banned and challenged frequently.I think thata.) depriving teenagers of this material is doing them a huge disservice. The book is EXCELLENT. I am not saying this because it is queer, I have rated plenty of queer books 1 or 2 stars. Some queer books are horrible. So, this is not a case of me praising this book 'because it's necessary.' I don't believe in that, I always review books based on the book, not out of any sense of 'as a liberal I have to support this.' I don't have to support it, and frequently don't. However, the book is amazing and should definitely be in high-school libraries and in every public library. I would recommend it to LITERALLY everyone, regardless of whether they are in the queer community or not. It's just a smart, relatable, helpful book for all humans.b.) The idea that 'conservatives' seem to have that reading about 'gays' will 'make children/teens gay' is really bizarre to me. No matter how many books I read about lesbians, I'm not a lesbian. *shrug* If you don't like dick, reading about dicks isn't going to make you suddenly want to take a dick. I think literature is a huge gift to humanity, and that children and teens will self-censor. I was allowed to read anything I wanted to growing up. And I did. And I think it was one of the best parenting decisions my parents ever made. Children and young people read what interests them. Tons of stuff doesn't interest them, forbidding them to pick it up is only going to spark their curiosity. I think the ideas and concepts in this book are great. I think they are really helpful. I think the book is educational and interesting. That being said, a lot of young people will have absolutely no interest in reading it. Just let things take their natural course.If you want to know what I think is very damaging to children and young people, it's Internet porn. I would worry about Internet usage much, much more than BOOKS. I guess books are ban-able, though, and the Internet isn't. All this hand-wringing is completely pointless if your kid has a smartphone and/or access to the World Wide Web. Pornography is very damaging, and it's being introduced at younger and younger ages.Two ironic and sad things about this book is when Kobabe learns to read (at age 11!) due to Harry Potter. Must sting a lot in light of Rowling's outspoken views that we now know (this isn't discussed in the book. I'm just speculating). And TWO, Kobabe finding refuge, solace, and comfort in the library while discovering queer books and trying to figure out eir gender and sexuality. Books are so important, public libraries are so important. And now eir important, sensitive, helpful book about gender identity is being banned.PEOPLE HAVE CLAIMED THIS BOOK IS PORNOGRAPHIC. IS IT? CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT'S IN IT?Sure. The book is NOT pornographic. However, it does tackle issues of sexuality and etc. It's definitely not meant to titillate or sexually excite people. It's not pornography.However, it does contain sexual material. Let's go over it.- Kobabe grows up with hippies and pees in the yard. There is a drawing of eir peeing in the yard as a 3-year-old.- E tries to go shirtless as a child (prepubescent) and is quickly made to cover up and be ashamed.- Discussions of periods, drawing of a bloody pad. I wouldn't even think this was 'offensive,' since it is a natural bodily function, but after the 'conservative' panic from Turning Red (Disney) about the HORROR of talking about menstruation, I'm mentioning this.- Kobabe fantasizes about having a penis (no penis is shown in this part). E also discusses how imagining two gay men having sex is what sexually arouses eir. And fantasizing about eir (non-existent) cock getting sucked. No penises shown, it's just talked about.- Kobabe's older sister kind of dares eir to taste eir own vaginal fluids. Kobabe is asexual and finds this 'gross.' We see this progress later as e grows up to honestly tell eir female dating partner that e won't go down on her.- Drawings of Kobabe undressing for eir first, terrifying pap smear. Shows a naked female body but it's just normal, not sexualized at all. The pap smear is horrifying for Kobabe, and there is a picture of eir naked body being impaled on knife to illustrate the trauma e feels about being penetrated. This is one of the most relatable and heart-wrenching parts of the book IMO.- There is a picture of a Grecian plate shown while Kobabe has a sexual fantasy in which a bearded naked man is touching the penis of a teenage boy.- There's a scene in the book where Kobabe's girlfriend agrees to fellate a strap-on that Kobabe is wearing. As I expected, Kobabe doesn't enjoy it at all because there is no sensation in a plastic dick, obviously. E never does that again, and actually kind of gives up on sex permanently by the end of the book. The book is surprisingly unsexual for supposed, alleged 'porn.' After all, Kobabe is an asexual and even as a teen has a very low sex drive.That's pretty much it, make your own decisions on if your kid/teen can read this (if they are even interested, which I doubt). I can easily and happily see it in any high school. Lower age than that I probably wouldn't put it in a middle-school or elementary-school library. Saying this should be banned from elementary school libraries, though, is kind of like saying 'We should ban rhinoceroses from elementary schools.' This book simply isn't going to be there, it's not an issue. And I'm completely against book banning of any sort. PERSONALLY as an individual I wouldn't hesitate to give it to any kid age 12+, but I understand I'm very loosey-goosey with what kids read because I read anything I wanted to growing up and I think kids/teens should read anything that holds their interest - especially a smart, well-written book like this which will educate them and make them think. I'm also a feminist, so that might explain why I like this book so much. After all, I read OUR BODIES, OURSELVES when I was young. It was GREAT, this is kind of akin to that.Another huge boon in this book is that Kobabe has a loving, supportive, kind family. It can be depressing to read queer memoirs where the family is hateful and shames and humiliates the author. This book illustrates what a kind, accepting family can look like for a queer youth.TL;DRSo glad I read this. I feel sad that Kobabe's book is being banned and challenged. It's an excellent book. Very helpful for any teens/adults who might be struggling to understand why traditional gender roles aren't suiting them; why the intense sexualization of American culture is not attractive to them. Why they don't spend hours fantasizing about a crush.But even beyond this, Kobabe is relatable to any reader. Any person who just wants to understand queer identity better should read this. Confused about what non-binary actually is? Confused about how a person can be born in a female body and not feel womanly or girlish? You don't even know what genderqueer means? Is Kobabe trans? What's going on here? Just read it. It's an excellent educational material for straight cisgender people. I think it can be a huge boon in taking away any fears or disgust people in 'mainstream' society might have regarding LGBTQIA+ people and that is super-important, especially nowadays with the right's insistence that 'queers are coming for your children.' The book clearly shows the reader a kind, relatable human being. Perhaps this is the real reason the book is being banned by the right. What if queer people are JUST LIKE YOU in a lot of ways?",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42837514-gender-queer,Gender Queer A Memoir.txt

"Monstress, Volume 3: Haven","In short? Anotherstunning, if sometimes confusing,installment. It took me a while to remember details after a two-year break from keeping up with these, and I actually spent quite a bit of time on the Wiki, but I found it easy to get reinvested in these characters.[image error]So, a brief reminder of the politics of the known world. On one side of the world is the human federation, oppressive to Arcanics and the cats alike. On the other side lie the Arcanics, half-human & half-animal beings persecuted for their powers. A shade of post-cataclysm adds further intrigue. The Ancients leave behind the Dawn and Dusk courts—one led by Maika’s grandmother, the Queen of Wolves, & one led by the duplicitous Corvin—and the cats, descendants of Ubasti who helped them to defeat the Old Gods in war.Within this context, several groups fight for power, or at the very least autonomy. The Cumaea, an anti-Arcanic group led by Mother Superior Desteria and the Inquisitrix, seek humans with power.The Blood Court, led by Maika’s father and thus the only other member of her monstrous bloodline, seek to usurp both the Dusk & Dawn courts.Smaller forces function as well: The Thyria-based trade empire of Kenzi is relevant to several plotlines. And then there’s the Ancients. The first Arcanic, the Shaman Empress, left behind the mask, broken into many pieces, which could offer a connection to another world. The Old Gods, meanwhile, are imprisoned in this other world, save for a few—including a few that have infiltrated the Cumaea, attempting to find the mask.In this series, we follow Maika Halfwolf, arcanic child of Moriko, who holds an Old God named Zinn inside her arm. She fights first to escape the Cumaea, then to escape from the Dawn & Dusk courts, and thento keep the mask fragment from the Mother Superior, who requires it to open the door between worlds. She struggles to gain trust in her companions: fellow arcanic Kippa, and cat nekomancer Ren,a bit of a double agent. She struggles with memories of her oldlover, Tuya,now working for the Dusk court under dubious circumstances.OKAY, now I’ve gotten that extremely long summary out of the way.This story focuses on dynamics of oppression via allegory, and does so in a world that is complex and rich. At times, you’ll need to turn a few pages back, but the story will still hold weight. There’s an idea here thatbehind all these petty conflicts are secrets of the world, a war with the gods that will eventually hit a boiling point. As the story has continued, it’s leaned into more of a post-cataclysmic vibe that has really resonated with me. I hope certain threads will begin to progress, as the story has finally reached a point where we understand the world to a certain degree.On a firm character level, this volume is coming closer to a theme I really like. I really love seeing Maika slowly grow feelings for Kippa. I loved the complexity of the relationship between Ren & Kippa in this one—it felt like a very well set up challenge of Ren’s willingness to do what he must. He’s ready to act for his own interests with Maika—but what about with Kippa?This is also the first volume where the complicated relationship between Maika and Tuya has been explicitly depicted as romantic, which like… we knew, but it’s nice to get confirmed. This dynamic is increasingly fascinating.Also, I spent the week after reading this binge watching the She-Ra reboot, soooo lesbians who end up on either side of a global conflict is the mood now I guess.As this is the third installment, I’d ask that anyone who wants a review for the beginning of the series, which I definitely did not understand as well as I should have, tocheck that review out. I would also recommend readingMelanie's two fantastically detailed wrap-ups! (Or the first half of this review, which I have filled with enough spoiler tags to populate a small country.)Blog|Twitter|Instagram|Spotify|Youtube|About|",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37491890-monstress-volume-3,"Monstress, Volume 3 Haven.txt"
"Monstress, Volume 2: The Blood","Vol. 1:Awakening★★★★★“Halfwolf’s daughter has returned.”InVolume Two: The Blood, We are thrown back into this amazing world that I love so much. We are reintroduced to a girl that is living with a monster inside of her. She is being hunted, but trying to piece together all the parts that make up her past, including what happened to her mother, who taught her at a young age to be strong in a world that will refuse to ever accept you.Moriko and her sidekicks that she doesn’t want to love, Kippa and Ren, are on a completely new adventure, which involves a ship, a pirate crew, a mysterious island, and maybe some ghosts. The banter is perfection, the art is quite literally a gift to the world, and the story is a masterpiece. This is my favorite graphic novel series of all time.And the message about never letting anyone control you, about rising to the top of a world that wants nothing more than to drag you down, is so powerful. This graphic novel is a fantasy inspired world that is ownvoices, and this graphic novel is filled with PoC characters. Also, Moriko only has one arm, but shows the world constantly how she should never be underestimated because of her disability. This is a super diverse series, and this story is filled with discussions about fear tactics and hate speech, and shows how easily hate speech can turn into hate actions.Trigger and content warningsfor a lot of blood, a lot of gore, and a whole lot of violence. Slavery, war themes, child abuse, animal cruelty, experimentations on unwilling living creatures, and one pretty dark birthing scene. This is a very dark graphic novel, please use caution.But this series is so perfect, and I truly believe it is a tier above anything else out there right now. If you feel like you are in the right mindset, I can’t implore you enough to pickAwakeningup and give it a try.I’m now going to just break down each single issue super quickly! Minor spoilers ahead!➽CHAPTER SEVEN-We are reintroduced to Moriko, and we get to revisit the monster that is trying to very hard to escape her. Kippa is the best character in all existence. Ren is second best. And I love all the cat people, so much, even when they are bad sometimes. Moriko finds a bone key and procures a ship and a crew to take her to an island that might have the answers about her mother.➽CHAPTER EIGHT-Moriko talks about how it has always hurt her that she never received any Goddess-marks to easily show that she is like the other Arcanic children, even though she carries so much power within herself. And then we see a new monster that lurks in the sea below, right before the ship is attacked.➽CHAPTER NINE-We get to see some flashbacks of Moriko’s mother teaching her, but we see how hard her mother was on her. Honestly? It just made me want to protect her even more. Also, Kippa is smart, perfect, and oh so loyal. I love her more than words.➽CHAPTER TEN-This issue had some of the most beautiful art I’ve ever seen in my entire life. I could frame something on every single page. Perfection. But Moriko, Kippa, and Ren are on a smaller boat, heading to the island together. And the bone key comes into play, in a pretty amazing way. But once they get to the island, they quickly realize they are not alone.➽CHAPTER ELEVEN-I loved this issue, because we get to know Moriko’s monster a little bit better through more flashbacks. And I’m loving all these breadcrumbs so much. And Moriko also gets more knowledge about her mother, but for a price.➽CHAPTER TWELVE-Oh boy, this concluding issue left me needing the next volume this very instant! Also, I know I shouldn’t, but I love the ferryman. Moriko is able to put on the part of the mask she has in her possession, but someone else senses it immediately; her father.Again, this graphic novel is everything to me. Marjorie M. Liu & Sana Takeda are a gift to the world, and I will read this series for as long as they create it. If you’re looking for an adult, high fantasy, dark, ownvoices, Asian inspired graphic novel series, please pick this up. From the art, to the characters, to the mysteries, to the messages, this is a masterpiece in every single way.Blog|Instagram|Twitter|Tumblr|Youtube|TwitchReadalong for theBooktubeSFF Awardswhich is being hosted by:🌑SamanthafromSam's Nonsense🌒FrankiefromFrankie Reads🌓KaitlinfromKitty G🌔RachelfromKalanadi🌕ThomasfromSFF180🌖ConnorfromConnor O'Brien🌗SamfromThoughts on Tomes🌘ChelseafromTheReadingOutlaw🌑ElenafromElena Reads Books",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33540347-monstress-volume-2,"Monstress, Volume 2 The Blood.txt"
"Monstress, Volume 1: Awakening","[2021 reread]i'm still so in love, still an all-time favorite.[2017 first read]I loved absolutely everything about this graphic novel. To date, it is by far the best graphic novel I have ever read, and even surpasses my love forSaga. I am completely blown away, and will count down the days untilVol. 2releases (June 6th, 2017).This story follows a seventeen year old girl named Maika, whose story starts out where she is being sold as a slave. The reader will immediately notice that Maika has a very strange tattoo of an eye on her chest, and she is missing an arm. Yet, it becomes very clear very early that Maika is much stronger than what she seems.Maika is struggling to hold in her monster, while also trying to get answers from her past. With the help of an adorable little half-fox and a poet cat, Maika is on a journey to discover herself, her past, and what's truly inside of her, all while she carries a very mysterious and sought after item.In this world there are five races:➽Humans- Like you and me.➽Ancients- Immortal, animal-like rulers with an immense amount of power.➽Cats- Much like people, can speak and fight, but much more adorable.➽Old Gods- Little to no knowledge of them.➽Areanics- Half of eachAlso in this world, there are factions at war:➽The Federation- Humans, who just hate magic users and refuse to let them live and breed. These humans will take Arcanics and make them slaves to do whatever terrible things they wish.➽Arcanics- Magic users, who are sort of hybrids of the Ancients. Also, two powerful courts, the Dawn Court and the Dusk Court, have risen up to defend against the Cumaea.➽Cumaea- Witch-like people that use Arcanic's body parts to make Lillium.People in this world will use a drug like substance called Lillium for power, regeneration, and in some cases, resurrection. Between the war and the use of this magical substance, this world is also now aware of things much bigger than the Federation and Arcanics.This graphic novel is not only bigger than most bind-ups, but it has significantly more writing than most graphic novels, too! You receive a lot, and I do mean a lot, of information and very quickly. This really worked for me, because it became way more of an immersion, while also reading closer to a book. Yet, I can understand how this would be a different reading experience for some, so I felt the need to bring it up.The story is so brilliant and impactful. I can already tell I'm going to be thinking about this world for such a long time, because this is the type of story that just sticks with you, while festering in your heart. I truly love everything about this.The art was so magnificent and I found myself constantly just staring at some pages in disbelief that a human created it. This art also brought very many tears to my eyes very many times, constantly evoking so much pure emotion from me. On top of having an amazing story, it is the best art I've ever seen in a comic, ever.Trigger warnings for human trafficking, slavery, child brutality, and many other dark themes that are in the violence and gore vein. This is a dark story, and it doesn't shy away from that darkness or its brutality.I loved everything about this graphic novel: the story, the characters, the art, the representation, everything. I honestly cannot see any graphic work ever beating this. I am in awe and my thoughts probably aren't even coherent, but this is something unique and special. Please give this comic series a try if you haven't already.I swear to you with my entire soul, this is nothing short of a masterpiece. This is maybe even a once in a lifetime masterpiece. I never put graphic novels on my ""best of the year"" list, but I think this is the year I make an exception forMonstress.Readalong for theBooktubeSFF Awardswhich is being hosted byAdrianafromPerpetual Pages,ChelseafromTheReadingOutlaw,ConnorfromConnor O'Brien,ElizabethfromBooks and Pieces,KaitlinfromKitty G,SamfromThoughts on Tomes,ElenafromElena Reads Books, andThomasfromSFF180!Blog|Instagram|Youtube|Ko-fi|Spotify|Twitch",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55883882-monstress-volume-1,"Monstress, Volume 1 Awakening.txt"
The Tea Dragon Festival,"""Just because something comes easily to you, does not mean it has no value. You find it effortless BECAUSE you love it, and that is why it is your gift.""pg. 82Once more we return to the cute and cozy world of tea dragons! These small domesticated pets are a lot of work but provide tea and memories to people.If you own a 'toy' dog you might get more out of this book than non-toy-dog owners. The tea dragons are quite similar to toy-breed dogs.O'Neill is famous for her LGBTQIA+ characters and this book is no exception. We have the gay couple from the last book (Hesekiel and Erik) and now we have a ??? person named Rinn who uses the pronouns they/them and dreams of being able to switch anytime from being male to being female to being male again. Not sure whether they are supposed to be genderfluid or non-binary or genderqueer or agendered or what. It's never discussed. Actually, the only reason I know Rinn uses the pronouns they/them is because it subtly (SO SUBTLY) is in the Cast of Characters section. Blink and you miss it - it's not even explicit.There's also interspecies romance in this book - Erik and Hesekiel are a man and a... llama? Chimera of some sort? IDK and later it's implied (SUBTLY) that Rinn and Aedhan are romantically involved by the end of the book, which is a romance of a human and dragon. Weredragon? Not clear.O'Neill also includes a deaf character in this book, which I thought was a nice touch. She uses illustrations to demonstrate people using sign language, either straight or with spoken words accompanying it.A jarring thing - and I mentioned this in the review of the first book - is the juxtaposition of the cutesy and the horrifying. The book is very cute. Everything is cute. People are peaceful and extremely tolerant. Everyone is helpful and kind. Everything is adorable and colorful. Which makes it all the more shocking when O'Neill bluntly includes stuff like, ""Erik and Hesekiel kill creatures for money."" They are basically bounty hunters. There's also a fight between Aedhan and an eaglefang which is bloody.TL;DRCute book with a very wide range of both skin colors and different gender/sex identities. Deaf representation. Comforting, cutesy, calming, cozy book. Strange underpinnings of violence which seem a bit out of place. Interspecies romances. Very pretty.NAMES IN THIS BOOKHesekiel mErik mRinn they/themAedhan mAya fAshyra fLesa f",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42369064-the-tea-dragon-festival,The Tea Dragon Festival.txt
Hilda and the Bird Parade,"I didn't give the book format much thought until now, but I realize that this tall, thin hardcover format is very European; I am most familiar with this size of book from Tintin or Lucky Luke. The author and publisher are British. I think this helps the books to stand out in North America amongst a sea of graphic novels.The subject matter in this entry continues to get more serious, setting this apart from a mere children's book. I think of it as an all-ages graphic series. The characters struggle with living in a new environment after the loss of their home in the prior book. The mother's emotional reactions to Hilda are very genuine; as I parent, I completely understood it when she snapped at Hilda with ""Because I said so!"", and the intense fear that she had when Hilda may have been lost. The group of children that Hilda encounters show callousness and cruelty; this sets Hilda apart. I adored when, on her turn to play Nicky-Nine-Doors/Knock-Knock-Ginger/Ding-Dong-Ditch or whatever you may call it, she just stands there and has a pleasant and kindly interaction with the woman who answers.This book does not spend much time on it, but there is a significant moment that highlights the main thrust of the series: the trolls.Overall, we see that even in town, this world is full of fantastic creatures and adventure. May we all keep an open heart like Hilda.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16057353-hilda-and-the-bird-parade,Hilda and the Bird Parade.txt
"Moomin: The Complete Tove Jansson Comic Strip, Vol. 02","I have bottomless affection for Jansson's Moomin creations. The novels were my favorite reads as a young reader, and Finn Family Moomintroll was read to me multiple times (at my insistence) as a bedtime story. I'm not sure why, but despite Moomintroll having become essentially the Mickey Mouse of Finland and probably that country's most instantly recognizable symbol, I still feel like the Moomin world is this sort of awesome secret place just for me. That probably speaks to the genius of its creator, her ability to create a private, intimate, immersive experience for every reader. I'm sure it also helps that in my mind Moomin = fond childhood memories.It's interesting to me that my two favorite comic strip dailies (this and Pogo by Walt Kelly) were close contemporaries, both reaching their heights in the mid-1950s. There are rather a lot of similarities between the two strips, actually: both revolve around lovingly rendered fantastic/animal characters who live bucolic livestyles in their respective reclusive rural habitats and who on occasion suffer intrusions from the outside world or go on minor adventures. Pogo ultimately became much more involved in topical political statements than Moomin (though I've only read the Moomin strips up through 1954 at this point so that could change I suppose), but Moomin features its moments of social commentary as well (see Moomin Begins a New Life in this volume). I wonder if the pastoral settings evoked in both these works reflects a general frustration with post-World War II modernity? Not sure, and a sample size of n=2 is pretty underrepresentative of the landscape of the comic dailies of the time. I'd be very interested in receiving referrals to works in a similar vein from a concurrent time as these two, though, so if you have them pass them along!",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/443101.Moomin,"Moomin The Complete Tove Jansson Comic Strip, Vol. 02.txt"
"Moomin: The Complete Tove Jansson Comic Strip, Vol. 01","Having been a fan of Tove Jansson's winsome Moomin books for many years, I was happy and excited to learn that for a few years in the 1950s, the Finnish author published a Moomin comic strip (oddly, in a British newspaper), now collected for the first time in this handsome volume, the first of five. What an unexpected treasure-trove. Yet despite being absolutely delighted to receive this for my birthday when it first came out, I was resistant to actually reading it. This was because I immediately started the first story (there are four in this book), and was at once put off by the fact that this was not exactly the Moomin-world I had come to know and love in the original books. There was Moomintroll, but he had no parents. There was Sniff, but a different, bolder, and more assertive Sniff. There were the Hattifatteners, but instead of being silent enigmatic electrical beings, they were a host of ""poor relations"" who descended on Moomintroll's house and demanded cocktails (that being said, they did look pretty funny all holding cocktail glasses). Moomintroll and Sniff meet Snuffkin and the Snork Maiden in this story as if for the first time, but in completely different ways than they did inComet in Moominland.So it sat on my shelf unread for a couple years. Then, in a new flush of Moomin-enthusiasm brought on by the Children's Book group's discussion ofFinn Family Moomintroll, I decided to be brave and try again. And oh, how glad I am that I did. The first story is in fact both the weakest and the most jarringly different from the books. In the second, Moomintroll is reunited with his parents. The third, in which Moomintroll, his parents and the Snork Maiden travel to the Riviera and hobnob with movie stars and playboys and unwittingly run up a huge hotel bill (they believe they have been invited to stay in the home of a large and unusually accommodating family) is at once absolutely hilarious, and completely different from anything that would have transpired in the chapter books. By that point, I had accepted that this comic-strip world was a sort of parallel universe to the books, and that it didn't matter so much if everything in the two worlds aligned. Also, as much as I love the books, I have to admit that they themselves are not always entirely coherent, with confusing time-lines and characters appearing and disappearing without explanation, and hardly any reference to past events. Jansson clearly felt no compunction at all about taking liberties with her own creations and saw them as very fluid and changeable. This ties in with a delightful but bewildering and giddy-making sense of anarchy I get from reading all her works for children. Jansson was certainly not writing to please pedantic people like the Snork Maiden's brother and the Hemulen.I still do prefer the books. The comic strip definitely highlights the wacky and surreal aspects of Jansson's story telling, at the expense of the introspective and melancholy elements (although I am eager to see if this will change as the comic strip goes on). The characters' personality traits are more exaggerated (oh, that Snork Maiden...if I thought she was girly and superficial before...), and they seem more likely to act in ways that are not entirely likable for the sake of propelling the story along. On the plus side, I love Jansson's art with a passion, and obviously, this being a comic strip, we get lots and lots of it here. I am now so excited to read the other volumes in this series, but I'm glad in a way, that I put off reading this one, and will probably space out the others, so as to stretch out and savor the experience as much as possible.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79548.Moomin,"Moomin The Complete Tove Jansson Comic Strip, Vol. 01.txt"
"Saga, Volume 10","Now that the individual episodes have been bound together, I reread this arc as a total unit and I have to say that might be the better way to go. I really enjoyed this issue as a whole, it’s sort of a rebuilding arc that picks up after a few year gap to match the gap we all waited between issues, introduces a lot of new characters, and begins to push the story in a new direction. Which can be a bit cumbersome for many in terms of enjoyment as it takes a moment to really get a foothold into some of this. Personally, I’m excited about it all. Hazel has grown considerably and the story is starting to shift from the adults to this new, younger generation lost in space amidst warfare and other violence. There is a lot of great high points in this issue, from Hazel learning to play music (I love all the scenes with the volatile bandmates), Alana just trying to scrape by and being as badass as ever, a cute new direction for Squire, and the way it cycles back through a lot of characters we haven’t seen in awhile to reestablish where everything is at. Sure. this one doesn’t hit with the biggest action plot of all the issues. It takes its time to stretch the legs of the new narrative arc, but it is something I am certainly looking forward to watching grow.This is the rebuilding year. Which I think is often looked at as something negative, like, things will be rocky because it is ‘rebuilding’. But I always think back to when I entered High School and joined the Cross Country team, which has recently graduated almost all of it’s varsity members and was almost half new members. It was the rebuilding year, our coach kept saying. But instead of really worrying about wins or losses, he kept the focus on, well,building. The thing I remember most about that year was how much emphasis on fun and camaraderie there was. Because rebuilding isn’t just about finding your footing, but it’s also about experimenting and finding something new, and I think that is what this issue does well.It is sad to see many great characters go, but I am excited to get to know these new ones as well. This was worth the wait. I read each episode as they came out, which was a bit rough as so much of it felt too bitesized to really latch on. Reading it as one big issue made it feel much smoother and really take hold. I wish I could tell you I'd wait until the next full issue to read it again knowing this, but I can't. I know damn well the moment an episode goes live I will instantly gobble in up and bask in my joy and regret. Oh! And in case you were worried, this issue does not let you down and delivers a massive emotional blow right at the end. Because BKV wouldn’t let us wait for the next one with good feelings, would he?",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29237224-saga-volume-10,"Saga, Volume 10.txt"
"Die, Vol. 2: Split the Party","2021 refresh before vol3:I loved this on second read and bumped my review to 5 stars accordingly. I think the biggest difference was having read Isabel Greenberg’s graphic novel “Glass Town: The Imaginary World of the Brontës” and gaining a better grasp of that literary history after first reading this. I’d definitely recommend that book in general, but also to more fully enjoy this one, though a wiki-skim on the Bronte’s lifelong obsession with their childhood myth-making is probably enough to appreciate the cliff notes version that one of the issues here revolves around.My impatience to fully grasp the Brontë bits last time lingered most in my mind, but there’s so much more I’d forgotten. Of special note is the 3 issues fleshing out different party members’ emotional backstories while also adding more texture to the world-building of their character class in the world of Die.Original 2020 review:4.5 starsDie begins settling into what it will be as an ongoing series, satisfyingly exploring the promise of the opening arc’s vertical slice while necessarily also losing a bit of its “where will this go from here?” novelty. The first follow-up story Gillen has chosen to tell is definitely interesting, but there’s still a minor sense of loss of the purely hypothetical that most sophomore entries have to overcome.Volume 2 backs off volume 1’s aggressive introductory pace in order to better establish the contentious backstories driving each of the five main party members. What is it that this fantasy world offers them an escape from? The first issue or two can get a little too cute with the narration’s meta elements, where it feels once or twice like I’m reading Gillen’s voice and not the character he’s writing for, but in general the dialogue manages its self-aware tone well.The literary figure that makes an appearance here feels a bit more meaningful to the overall story than Vol1’s inclusion, but I was also less familiar with her, so it wasn’t quite as impactful for me personally. The painted art is still beautiful throughout but more constrained for the first half or so of the book, and then Gillen gives Hans a bit more visual material to wow with in the last issue or two and she creates some especially amazing pages. Can’t wait for Vol3 later this year!",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49426262-die-vol-2,"Die, Vol. 2 Split the Party.txt"
What Is Left,"Elegant and cool, Valero-O'Connell leaves everything so open to the imagination, yet specific. This story (and it's seamless illustrations) have the feel of a surreal, space age dream. The ship we are on is fueled by one woman's dreams and memories and when it crashes our protagonist is stuck, with the source of the life that fuels the ship, in a sort of limbo. She can never REALLY know this person, yet she knows everything about them and she can never truly interact with the dreams and yet she sees every part of this girl's life, in no order in particular. Valero O'Connell is so talented, and so effortless in her composition and the flowing of a narrative through clean, smooth line and exact coloring. The colors in this book are more complex and still somehow less refined and paired down than the simple black, white, pink of 'Laura Dean keeps breaking up with me' but there is a LOT to look at and dive into, much like the memories being portrayed. I did find myself wishing the color in the entire book were as bold and dark as the breathtaking cover. This is a quick read!

Grimoire Noir,"With summer receding into autumn, I pulled Vera Greentea and Yana Bogatch’sGrimoire Noirdown from the shelves during a thunderstorm the other night to revisit this spooky and artistically gorgeous graphic novel. I am a huge sucker for noir aesthetics and plot which this book certainly delivers on But wait, there’s more (to be read in Billy Mays’ voice)! Blackwell is cut off from the rest of the world because its inhabited by witches and ghosts and the story is complete with a fairly rich lore on how they came to be and why only women are able to possess these powers. While a bit light and rushed on plot even with all it’s twists and turns, the artwork more that delivers and this is such a fun ride any hiccups in the narrative are easily glossed over making this a perfect read for spooky season.The noir elements are delightful here with greyscale art, endless rain instead of fog, loads of depression and a detective in a trenchcoat and fedora aided exclusively by women in his search for his missing sister. Nobody smokes but my noir itch has been scratched and there are plenty of red herrings to misdirect the plot in order for more backstory and worldbuilding to slowly seep in. The book also delivers on witchcraft elements with a mysterious coven, cool powers unique to each witch, and lots of ghosts and dark narrative elements that will creep under your skin. It’s well constructed and a lot of fun.The story sometimes feels rushed but overall it works. There is a great tension between the two protagonists, Bucky and Chamomile, who were friends until Bucky’s relative jealousy of her witch abilities began to fracture their bond. She aids him in his search for his likely-kidnapped sister, but keeps her distance and functions as a sort of femme fatale for the noir aspects. The flashback scenes of their friendship and their fumbling attempts to reconnect are moving and add another great layer to the already textured emotionally somber and heavy tone of the book. Narrative aside, the characters really drive it and there is a very wonderful and diverse cast for the story to play with, most notably the witches’ coven and a slow-burn side-story about a powerful family from which the coven leader, Matilda, belongs. Luckily all the side-plots converge and the conclusion feels very satisfying and even surprising. A noir success for sure.What really makes this story fun, however, is the art. Everything is highly stylized and absolutely gorgeous. The landscapes are eerie and detailed and the character designs are outrageously cool. The greyscale art has only small touches of color on occasion, which really pop, suchs as Cham’s piercing blue eyes. The characters are very expressive, the frames feel very fluid, and the art produces such an engaging and eerie tone it is hard to put down yet you’ll find yourself pausing to get lost in the lovely art.While the story might only deserve 3 stars, 5 stars can’t contain the brilliance of the art and giving this anything less than 4 feels cheap. My 10 year old has been obsessed with this book for 2 years now and is frequently found rereading it under the covers at night. It is quick but lasting, and just a fun-filled ride.

"Mirka Andolfo's Mercy: The Fair Lady, The Frost, and The Fiend","Man, this is one of those weird comics thatalmosthits the mark, and then justdoesn't.The art and coloring are just lovely.But.Some of the scenes when the creatures appeared were a bit too confusing and hard to visually understand. I'd go back, stare at a panel for a bit, scratch my head, move to the next panel, stop, go back to the previous panel...Wash, rinse, repeat.However, considering the art was the main reason I was attracted to this title, it's a somewhat minor complaint.My biggest complaint is that there are about 3 volumes of story crammed into one. It's just missing hunks of information.How did these creatures get here? What is this portal thing? What happened to make the mine explode? Why is no one leaving this scary-ass town!And what the hell are the backstories for all of these characters?!The monster hunters. <--no idea what their deal is or how they came to be. They just show up and start eating parts of the creatures? What?!The family that owned the mine. <--WHAT. THE. FUCK.The son Mercy targets. <--no idea. This guy was straight-up cannon fodder.The mother. <--did her husbanddiein the mine explosion or is she married to the old guy who Ithinkwas the brother of the guy doing experiments that Ithoughtshe was married to?And what about the dude who was doing the experiments? Why was he doing that? Was he just evil or was there a reason?The mother's helper dude. <--what the hell was his story?! And how did he end up with Rory at the end?Joe and Becky. <--I can't EVEN with the missing information on these two. There's a whole 'nother volume needed to tell their story.Mercy. <--What even wasanyof that?! She manages not to kill the kid because she called hermom, but then immediately EATS the guy that she has feelings for? Whhhhhy?Rory <--the ending makes no sense. Shouldn't she have been more creature than Rory? Like what happened to Goodwill? Why did Rory stay Rory and Mercy and Goodwill were both 'creatures' in human skin?AND WHERE THE HELL WERE THESE CREATURES FROM? What were the 'pods' or 'sprouts'?And how convenient that their food source in whatever dimension they're from is human brains.The bottom line is that I felt that this was chock full of half-baked ideas.

"Die, Vol. 1: Fantasy Heartbreaker","InDie, six teens enter a fantasy role-playing game, disappearing from the mundane world for two years. When they reappear, they are missing one of their members and carrying scars, both physical and emotional, from their ordeal.Fast forward twenty five years, and a blood stained die shows up on someone's birthday, mirroring the date when they last entered the game. The group has to face the fantasy world that has given them nightmares for decades in order to put the past to rest. But some things are easier said than done.Readers of this series seem heavily divided on its quality. I thought it was brilliant.This isn't because of the fantasy elements which, as many have noted, rely heavily on tropes and the established world building of touchstone series likeThe Lord of the RingsandThe Chronicles of Narnia.What I loved was the character development and its relatability for aging gamers.The author shares a series of essays in the back of the graphic novel about the development of the story and characters as well as their associations with classic rpgs. He nails the reasons why I loved the book so much:""... the simple idea of six forty-something adults contrasting their teenage fantasies with the realities of where their lives ended up. It's a pure midlife crisis scream of a book. And the bit that got me? The idea that maybe part of me did disappear into a fantasy world at the age of sixteen and never came out.""In the hero's journey, we venture forth into trials and return changed but bearing gifts from the experiences we went through. That format- there and back again- seems so clear cut and simple in many of the ""through the looking glass"" fantasy stories.It is not so simple in this one.InFantasy Heartbreaker, the journey isn't finished when the characters return to where they started and they aren't bearing gifts, but a curse. It is only through the natural passage of time and the development of the adolescent into the adult, that the heroes in this story can finish their journey or, unbeknownst to them, begin an entirely new one.This delayed emotional development speaks to any manner of gamers, both video or tabletop, who may find themselves, for a variety of reasons, gaming with a dysfunctional group of people over and over again each week. Perhaps this is because there are only a few people in their lives who love to game as much as they do.For whatever reason, from the outside, such intense and conflict-prone relationships can seem confusing at best or borderline abusive at worst. But from inside the group itself, the bonds created through the traversing of realms of the imagination and overcoming obstacles as a team are real and important.The members of the group form a family of sorts- one that they chose rather than one they were born with. It can be beautiful but bewildering. Something that one has to experience to truly understand.Sort of like visiting a different world, and never really coming home again.In addition to the peek into gamer culture, the artwork inFantasy Heartbreakeris gorgeous, one of the most beautiful I've ever seen in a comic.Highly recommended for readers, and gamers, who like fantasy graphic novels.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42667807-die-vol-1,"Die, Vol. 1 Fantasy Heartbreaker.txt"
The Promise,"StoryThere are several story arcs going throughout the book; the main plot is the story of Yu Dao, but there's also the stories of Toph's academy and the Avatar Fan Club, all of which have further events on a more personal level which relate to characters' development. All in all, quite a lot goes in this book. That much is indeed, true, but the pacing of the story flows amazingly well and doesn't lag too much. Even if Part 2 is basically filler, sub-plot and set-up for Part 3, it still feels part of the greater narrative and the time it takes for characterisation is great to go through and doesn't feel like detracting anything from the main plot. The presentation of all three Parts in one hardcover definitely helps in this regard, as they read much better together as a single book.As for the story itself, one major theme presented is colonialism and its effects, which Yang deals with very realistically. This is an issue particularly close to my heart due to my country’s history. After about 170 years under British rule, most Maltese were indeed afraid of being separated from their colonisers due to their daily interaction with them and the fact that their livelihood often depended on the British services stationed here. Yu Dao is a great reflection of the human realities long-term colonisation and inter-cultural integration result in, which should be there considering the length of the War. Having Kunyo in there was also a great way of symbolising the residual resentment at anti-colonialism common Fire Nation citizens may feel. After a hundred years of war and colonialism, it makes not to have everyone suddenly change overnight.While on the issue of inter-cultural relations, it was also interesting to see Yang tackling the issue of cultural appropriation within the framework of the Avatar world. The fan club is shown to be well-meaning and genuinely interested in Air Nomad culture, but their enthusiasm as fans gets the better of them and they offend Aang with their lack of understanding. I also like the fact that the issue makes Aang reflect on his role as the last Airbender. He takes on the responsibility of guardian of his people’s culture and takes it upon himself to ensure it survives by founding the Air Acolytes through the fan club.I also like the way The Promise deals with the conflict between one’s ideals and their relationships. In the post-war Avatar world, the ideal would mean a separation of the nations as they were before the War, but the human reality of the people of Yu Dao has to result in compromise. Sneers starts out trying to live up to his ideals, but when faced with the choice of living with his loved one, he has to give it up for the sake of his human relationship with Kori. Kuei likewise decides not to retake Yu Dao when seeing how people live there together. This point is further beautifully illustrated by paralleling the potential fate of Yu Dao with Aang and Katara’s own future. It was a smart move which raised the stakes by making the issue more personal.Moreover, I like how Yang manages to intertwine and collect all story threads and sub-plots together, even the most seemingly divergent ones. Kunyo is emboldened to re-take his dojo from Toph due to Zuko retracting his support from the HRM. Even the Avatar Fan Club plot, whose origin does not owe anything to the main plot, becomes the catalyst for further reflection by Aang on inter-cultural relations and integration and the larger inter-nation scale. The way Aang perceived stronger nations just taking on some aspects of weaker nations’ culture as a costume was a great way to tie in the issues of colonialism and integration.In interviews Yang explains that he was chosen to pen the sequel/s to the original show because he is a fan – referring his webcomic criticising the live-action film in particular - and it shows. Despite Nick perhaps wanting to target a younger demographic, Yang tries to imbue it with the same complexity of the original, and he does succeed (with help from Mike and Bryan, of course), as seen above. He also manages to get in some in-continuity jokes only fans would know, such as Sokka lamenting the loss of his space sword or commenting how Toph’s touchy about normal-sighted people complaining about the dark. Even Toph’s meteorite bracelet is brought back and becomes an interesting (though minor) plot device. Yang clearly reveres the original show enough to want to make a worthy successor.In fact, the only major plot point which admittedly disappointed me was the climax. More than anything else, it’s not the actual story point per se, but the execution which irked me a bit. In two and a half books we were being told a battle was coming, but when it came, I was rather unimpressed. It just ended too soon before I was given a chance to take it in and get the sense of loss and destruction such a battle should have. The whole sequence just a felt a bit rushed and headed to a peaceful conclusion – which happens off-screen - too quickly. I get it that 'The Promise' is about the eponymous promise, but I would have also liked to see the actual meeting between Kuei and Zuko to see how much the two have learned from the experience. My first impression upon reading the ending was that I had basically gone through an inflated prelude to 'The Search'. While it makes sense that Yu Dao does not instantly become the Republic City we know of in 'The Legend of Korra' (and it will continue to evolve in that direction in future installments of the graphic novel series), it would have been better to get a holistic sense of closure with just a hint of things to come. This in no way takes away from the other merits of the story, but it leaves me hoping some threads are picked up again in future.CharactersFirst of all, I’d like to point out that all returning characters’ voices are written such that they really do capture those of the original series. I had no problem projecting the original voice actors’ performances onto their respective character’s dialogue in my head.While all characters get the same treatment in that regard, The Promise is squarely focused on Aang and Zuko dealing with and moving on from the legacies of their respective predecessors (I’m sure you’ve deduced it already from the cover). Aang tries to live up to his responsibilities as the Avatar in the post-War world and avoid Roku’s regrets and mistakes, thus accepting to make the promise to Zuko. In the end, however, he chooses not to live up to his promise because of their friendship, and to go on his own path. His relationship with Roku also changes in parallel with this realisation, which is just a pleasure to watch. Roku was marked by the fact that his leniency towards Sozin as a friend was not returned in kind and led to the War. I don’t know how Aang initially expected Roku to go past that, considering how he already had told him to kill Ozai and saw Zuko’s promise as a moment of clarity. Seeing Aang realise this and decide to break off his link to Roku was heart-wrenching, as it should have been with the loss of a mentor and friend. Aang has already shown himself to favour his relationships to the traditional detachment expected of the Avatar in 'The Guru', so it’s great to see that trend continue here. He actually goes further when he comes to accept this fact about himself and that he doesn’t want to change it, even if future (and past) Avatars may want to. Aang first missing his culture and then realising he’s responsible for its survival was also a great step forward for his character (as has been discussed above).Here we also get to see Aang as Katara’s boyfriend; well, I have to agree with Sokka about the oogies on that one. They’re naturally still going through the initial lovey-dovey phase of their relationship, something I’ve seen quite often with my own friends. I’m quite willing to let it pass as it is realistic, just as long as we see them move on in future to a point where they don’t have to call each other ‘sweetie’ so often.Zuko is in a similar situation, trying to live up to his newfound responsibilities as Fire Lord without turning into his father. Much like Aang, the pressures of the throne and the expectations it carries lead him to search the advice of his predecessor. I’ve seen some fans criticise this development as a regression of the character, but I couldn’t disagree more. Being the leader of the Fire Nation places Zuko in a situation where he must protect the interests of his people against the interests of other sovereigns. Irrespective of his ideals – and here I remember Iroh calling him an idealist in the show’s finale - he must fulfil his duties as a statesman. The only person who can really understand this is his father, Ozai, who really does have some “wisdom of experience” (note that he was right about the Earth King’s intentions not to show weakness, for instance).While on the issue of Ozai, I have to say I like the fact that he is somewhat humanised and calmed down in the story. His behaviour and words confirm something that wasn’t delved into in the show: his political thought is Realist. Ozai believes that sovereignty requires amorality for the sake of safeguarding the interests of the state. Whereas the original series showed him to be a more evil character in other aspects of his life to be sure, at least here we get to see some more motivation and understanding for his decisions as Fire Lord apart from his just wanting to ‘take over the world’. These represent much more complex issues of what is right and wrong, which is seen in Zuko’s decision not to ignore his father’s advice completely. Much like Aang begins to see Roku as not completely good, Zuko begins to see his father as not completely evil. Aang moves away from Roku’s absolutes, but Zuko does decide not to let the Avatar decide right and wrong for him, as Ozai told him to do. It’s the intention behind this decision that distances him from his father, as he does have a good moral compass and does want to judge his actions as morally correct.Indeed, Iroh does represent a better mentor for him, as his behaviour and words of encouragement at the end of 'The Promise' are a lot less stifling than Ozai’s and show a lot more faith in Zuko. In fact, it left me asking why Zuko didn’t contact his uncle sooner. I can understand his intentions to give him his well-deserved peace, but Zuko’s stubbornness in the face of his previous respective experiences with his father and uncle is, perhaps, a bit too convenient.With Aang and Zuko being the focus of the story and get fantastic character development, the other main characters are, admittedly, more static. Sokka remains just the same meat and sarcasm guy we all know and love. He cracks jokes, invents names for things, comes up with ideas, and his bickering with his sister is just as fun for us to watch as ever. His interactions with Toph are also fun as the two form an great duo in Part 2. Katara doesn’t do anything of real consequence other than being Aang’s counsel until Part 3, in which she shows his and Zuko’s flawed approaches to Yu Dao. Suki doesn’t get much to do either, apart from that one panel which had so many of us thinking we were going to see something between her and Zuko. Supporters of the strong female characters of the series may not like them being relegated to supporting their male counterparts, but the scope and size of the story couldn’t really leave room for other options. Mai in particular suffered most, as she’s written off rather quickly in what was, in my opinion, a rather out-of-character moment (considering all she went through for the sake of her love for Zuko).Toph, on the other hand, gets the most attention of the remaining main cast. We see her take on the role of teacher as a calling – while still being, well, Toph - and have her first doubts about her teaching methods. Toph was always great for not only being such a fun character, but also for occasionally demonstrating great self-awareness and a human fragility. We get to see more of that here when she doubts if her treatment of the students is simply her inflicting her own pain onto others. It was a great touch to see her visibly moved when everything seemed to work out, even if she had to show her students the affection behind her tough exterior unintentionally to get results.Other minor returning characters’ development varies. Smellerbee and Longshot remain understandably hardened adversaries of the Fire Nation, considering the War recently cost them their leader, Jet. (While on this topic, I would have loved an actual comment from them on Jet’s fate and how they escaped!) Sneers goes through the most development as he comes to terms with the fact that he values his relationship with Kori more than his ideals, gaining a more nuanced vision of the world like other Freedom Fighters before him. Earth King Kuei is shown to have learned from his experiences during the events of the show, and now understandably seems determined not to show the same weakness as before. However, befitting his greatly sheltered life, he is still afraid to lead the troops personally. I find it strange, though, that he did not encounter other towns like Yu Dao during his travels around the world while in exile.So where does this leave the new characters introduced in The Promise? Well, for the most part, are pretty one-dimensional and serve more as agents of the story than actual characters to be developed. Kori remains the same until the end, her most defining feature being her will to protect her home and way of life. In his commentary Yang says he thinks of Toph’s students as personifications of certain vices and compared them to the different Lanterns from Geoff Johns’s 'Green Lantern', which you may agree with. (However, I don’t this comparison does the latter justice as at least all Johns’s characters do develop.) Sure, the students learn to see something else in themselves other than their stereotypes, but we don’t see their newfound self-confidence go much further than allowing them to metalbend.ArtI admit that my fist impression of the art was that it is too childish and bright. I had already seen Gurihiru’s art in 'The Lost Adventures', and couldn’t help but feel that others artists featured there would have been better-suited. However, the art grew on me and I came to appreciate it on many points. The covers are brilliant, and can be seen in all their glory in the Library Edition as all lettering and titles are removed. The facial expressions are spot-on, the panels are for the most part arranged with certain dynamism, and I liked the new designs both for returning characters and new ones. There is also a certain attention to detail which could be found in the original series. For instance, Aang subtly ages and becomes taller than Katara over the course of the story, and the metal boar used in Sokka and Toph’s scheme is not discarded but later adorns the entrance of Toph’s school.My only complaint on the art is that I can’t help but feel that the fight scenes and choreography from the show didn’t translate well to graphic novel form. I actually do not blame Gurihiru at all on this count; bending is a fighting style which inspired awe due to a combination of precise movements and sound. Managing to achieve the same style in comic book panels and without the use of sound would be a great challenge for any artist.Library Edition AdditionsThe most obvious addition given the Library Edition is, of course, the actual presentation. Like all similar Dark Horse books, the hardcover is great quality and feels durable. Additionally, the page size presented here is larger then the original paperbacks. Unfortunately I don’t currently have the regular edition of the three separate Parts, so I can’t compare sizes or the images properly. However, it should be noted that, despite the larger size of the page, the actual graphic novel panels are surrounded by a rather wide margin for annotations, so I’d calculate the images being only around 20-25% larger.With regard to the annotations themselves, they’re a great addition to the actual story. They often give insight into the inspiration behind certain concepts, themes and/or the creative process behind certain visual elements. They can give certain trivia, like Yu Dao’s inspiration being partly based on Japanese islands previously under German rule which still produce beer to this day. At other points, the details provided help the reader read into the details of the story more appreciatively, like the place of euthanasia by consent and prayer in Buddhism and the theme of colonialism. Sometimes, Yang includes comments which exude his fan’s glee, like his weirdness at having to revisit the crucial final scene between Zuko and Ozai and his love of all things Toph.The hardcover edition also features some minor edits, often to correct mistakes or goofs found in the original. For instance, the Zukos’s scar from his confrontation with Azula is added to Part 3, among others.The concept art at the end of the book is good, even if nothing ground-breaking. We get to see the character models of the main cast (whose initial designs, it turns out, were actually improved upon), the initial sketches of the covers, and other minor tid-bits of information. While all fascinating, I think they could be improved upon. My guess is that with all the information given in the annotations throughout the book, not much was actually left for the final pages.VerdictEven if with The Promise is not a perfect return to form for 'Avatar: The Last Airbender', it is most definitely a welcome one. Despite its flaws, it gets a definite recommendation from me. Avatar fans will love getting to see their favourite characters again. To non-Avatar fans, I'd recommend seeing the series first to enjoy the book as much as possible.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16231346-the-promise,The Promise.txt
Young Avengers,"Oh boy this was hard to rate because I really loved and also thought a lot of it was very stupid... I've decided that enjoyment triumphs, but definitely with some caveats.Here's what I really liked:- I like teen superheroes and I think these guys are well done! They feel like teens (although the artists didn't all get the message... more on that later) and have pretty realistic concerns even while they're being, you know, superheroes- The team end up feeling like friends! One of my least favourite things with the MCU is that they don't devote any time to making the team actually feel like... theylikeeach other, so I'm glad this gave me my fix of actual bonding etc.- I get the complaints that there isn't enough fleshed out aboutwhyKate is here at all but that doesn't change the fact that I love Kate :)- Cassie wears whatever random baggy stuff she wants to in non-superhero mode- Billy and Teddy's relationship is so cute! And they actually get called boyfriends. Disney's first gay character could never...- The big fight scenes in the last issue are just GORGEOUS. Also I just like the art in this in general- The plots are pretty solid - they'd be really good if the arcs got more than 6 issues each, but I digress. Iron Lad going back in time to prevent himself becoming Kang the Conqueror is a fun plot and is a good plot catalyst, and the Kree-Skull custody battle is fun tooAnd here's what I didn't:- My biggest issue is that this run is very rushed. As I said, each arc is only 6 issues each and the plots just seem way too big for that much space, especially with the effort of squeezing in convoluted backstories among that- The good old sexualisation of characters strikes again... these characters are CHILDREN goddamnit... this is also I think a bit of a symptom of the fact that the artists just aren't great at drawing teens- WHY did it have to be the ONLY black character who was taking drugs to become a superhero... especially as he literally gets superpowers in the end anyway it adds NOTHING to the plot- One of the issues starts with Cassie and Iron Lad kissing for... no apparent reason? I thought I'd missed an issue or something but no, it is just a romance with absolutely no lead up at all. Actually there are a number of romance-type things in this that I really didn't like... Eli is implied to like Kate but purely because he's mean to her?? What's that all about. I've seen some people suggest that they put gratuitous straight relationships in there to distract from the gay one they put in, which I guess is fair enough, but they could've at least tried to make it make sense...- Patriot just kind of sucks in this. He's sexist, rude and he keeps being the person that suggests they sacrifice their friend to avoid a fight. AND he's the guy that lies to everyone. They could've written him as a guy that was trying to be pragmatic with suggesting that the good of the many outweighs their friend but NO he just sucks.- They kill off Teddy's mom for... no reason really. The Super Skrull even says sorry afterwards it was SO pointless. Poor guy only had one parent to start with... you didn't have to murder his mother in front of him",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2371823.Young_Avengers,Young Avengers.txt
kings of nowhere Volume 1,"""We're a crew? There's only two of us.""""Now there's three of us. So we're a fuck'n crew, aight?""""Well, shit.""For a youth whose intuition is to search out power and desire it for himself, stress and anxiety tend to puncture hopes and dreams a little too easily. Does he have an emotional fulcrum over which he might pivot his despair? Does he have a logical anchor to which he might affix his crumbling sense of self?KINGS OF NOWHERE #1views these questions as largely rhetorical. Because Bili, the son of a drug kingpin, is on an ever-narrowing trajectory toward destruction.Life on the street makes use of the boy as a punching bag; familiar locals steal his soda, knock out his teeth, and threaten worse. Life at home is restless and hopeless; mother is strong, but her strength is waning, and father is devoid of empathy. Again, an ever-narrowing path.The rage Bili feels when cornered. The fear that nips at his heels when he realizes nobody is in a position to save him. The disgust that roils in his gut when he realizes that violence, abuse, and human ignorance are the only three recurring beats on the sun-scalded streets of Lo Divino. These are what feed Bili's transformation from boy into beast.KINGS OF NOWHERE #1is an intense book. The simplified, linear narrative of a kid in a crummy town, living a crummy life, earns a fair treatment here. The skies are hot and fuzzy, bracketed by aging, mismatched infrastructure and palms growing out of cracks in the pavement. Readers feel claustrophobic from page one. It's easy to dismiss the pregnant pauses stuck between each and every bout of human wickedness when wickedness is so common, but here, beasts shed tears, beasts quiver with shame, beasts resent the darkness they've been made to inhabit.And as Bili crawls into the light, a new world emerges. His new allies include an intensely, almost terrifyingly confident guy named Hamed and his buddy, Zatoichi, who may or may not be blind, funnily enough. Zatoichi doubts they can call themselves a crew, at a mere three, but a lust for the truth and a heart in search of revenge tends to embolden the disadvantaged. If Bili and his new friends are going to take out his corrupt father, then they'll need to tap into their baser instincts.KINGS OF NOWHERE #1crinkles with extraordinarily fresh character designs, detailed and efficient coloring, and art so broadly expressive that it's fair to say no two emotions are ever the same. There are deeper, darker questions to ask of cities like this, of children like this, of how far one will go in search of justifying reciprocal violence, of how many father figures one needs to figure out who one wishes to be. But again, these questions are largely rhetorical. Because for now, for Bili, the name of the game is survival.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45480101-kings-of-nowhere-volume-1,kings of nowhere Volume 1.txt
The Search,"I had a hard time rating this one, but ultimately decided to be a bit harsh. Of all the storylines to expound on from the show, this is THE ONE not to mess up. What happened to Ursa is the BIGGEST unanswered question from the show, and Ursa is one of my favorite unsung characters. While there are certainly things I thought were okay about her continuation and some pretty cute nods to the show (namely, the origin of Zuko’s blue spirit mask and more details on the Love Amongst the Dragons play), there are just too many things that were rushed, unfinished, or just felt WRONG about Ursa’s story. She makes some decisions in this comic that the Ursa from the show never, ever would have. My biggest problems will be described below, but they will contain heavy spoilers.1. That stupid freaking letter -In looking for clues to where Ursa could have gone, Azula (and later Zuko) find and read a letter Ursa wrote to the real love of her life that reveals Zuko isn’t Ozai’s son. Obviously, Azula wants it as evidence that she is the true heir to the Fire Nation throne. It also turns out that Ozai knew of this letter (he intercepted all of his wife’s mail), and the story uses this as an explanation for why he has always hated Zuko.First of all, I hate the idea that Ozai’s treatment of Zuko needs some big, dumb plot twist of an explanation. An explanation already exists that was beautifully simple and felt movingly REAL: toxic families exist. Parents exist that care more about their own status than about their children. Parents exist that think their children should be obedient above all else. Parents exist that think children who refuse to live as they are told need to be punished with physical force and emotional cruelty. Parents exist that equate emotional sensitivity with weakness. Ozai is that parent. His hatred for Zuko is very simple and selfish: Ozai sees his children only as objects to advance or hinder his own status. He viewes Zuko’s compassion as feebleness. He sees Zuko’s imperfect bending as embarrassing and disappointing. He sees Zuko as a failure who isn’t living up to his father’s heritage. What does a parent like this do with such a child? Berates him, punishes him, and sometimes ignores him completely. It’s really that simple. This simplicity made their entire family dynamic feel poignantly real and tragic, and I just don’t think it needed the over explanation offered by the comic. It cheapens their already interesting and complex familial relationships.Second, writing his letter goes against everything Ursa (from the show) believes in. If Ozai is the epitome of the abusive father, Ursa is the epitome of the protective mother. Ozai is a prince of a powerful nation, so Ursa herself doesn’t have a lot of power to stand against him. Even so, she does EVERYTHING she can within her small sphere of influence to protect her children, no matter the cost to herself. When Ozai displays public cruelty towards Zuko, Ursa still reaches out to comfort her son. If you are living in an abusive relationship (If Ozai is this cruel to his children, he would CERTAINLY be equally cruel to his wife), speaking out against your spouse is a HUGE risk to your own personal safety. Ursa knows this, but does it anyway, because she loves her children THAT MUCH. When it ultimately comes down to it, Ursa sacrifices the one thing she cares about (a life with her children) for the safety of her children. She is one of the most altruistic, brave characters in the show. THIS is the essence of Ursa as a character.Now, would this same character, knowing how abusive her spouse is, knowing how vulnerable her kindhearted son is to his father’s tyranny, WRITE DOWN PHYSICAL EVIDENCE THAT WOULD PAINT HER SON AS A TARGET?! Ursa even suspects Ozai is reading her mail, but she does this anyway. In no freaking world would Ursa ever do anything to further endanger her children. If Ozai is this cruel to Zuko THINKING Zuko is his son, what would he do if he suspected Zuko wasn’t his child and heir? I wouldn’t put it past Ozai to outright kill Zuko if he discovered this information, and I don’t think Ozai would have encountered a lot of resistance if he attempted to do so. Ursa would know all this, and she would NEVER endanger her children like that. Even assuming Zuko would somehow survive his father’s cruelty to adulthood, it would STILL endanger him down the road by putting the legitimacy of his rule into question.The real kicker is that it’s later revealed that this letter isn’t even true! Ursa wrote it “trying to hurt” Ozai and saying “It was just wishful thinking.” I don’t believe Ursa would write this letter even if it were true, but to endanger her son further for such petty reasons? Never ever ever! This paints Ursa as a very stupid, selfish character, which is just the antithesis of who she really is.2. Oops, I forgot!Later in the story, it is revealed that Ursa had her face changed by a spirit so she could start a new life without fear of further retaliation from Ozai. Fine. But she ALSO asked this spirit to wipe her memories of her past life with Ozai. Unfortunately, this would also include wiping away her memories of her children. She will no longer remember anything about her children or even the fact that she has children. She will be able to begin her life fresh without these “painful” memories. Now, this isn’t a REQUIREMENT of the face change. The spirit changes plenty of faces without impacting memories and even tells Ursa she doesn’t have to lose her memory if she doesn’t want to. Ursa chooses of her own free will to forget her children.Again, this just feels so unlike the Ursa from the show, and it really cheapens the sacrifice she made for them. While it would be painful to live her life with the knowledge she can never see her children again and with the worry that her children are still living in an abusive, dangerous environment, that is the life she chose in order to protect them, and I honestly don’t think Ursa would WANT to forget them, no matter how anguished she is that she can never be with them. While I’m sure the memories of them would bring her some pain, I honestly think, for Ursa, they would bring her more joy. She loves her children more than anything, and I can’t imagine her ever choosing to forget them. Forgetting them also feels selfish and irresponsible when they are still in such a dangerous environment. The Ursa I know would wait and watch and hope she could someday be reunited with them.Also, at one point Ursa even mentions that getting a new face will allow her to sneak in to visit her children, which seems MUCH MORE like something Ursa would want. But when presented with the chance to forget them entirely, Ursa kind of seems to forget this plan for no reason. With this alternative, I can’t imagine why Ursa would EVER choose to forget the children who were her whole reason for living, and this whole decision just doesn’t make sense for her character.3. Poor AzulaSo, the other Ursa-adjacent storyline that deserved a proper wrapping up is the fate of poor Azula. Having thrived under her father’s cruel attentions, she begins to crack towards the end of the show when she starts to realize that cruelty and fear aren’t working for her anymore. Her friends abandon her, and the father she has spent her whole life trying to please shows his regard for her isn’t as high as she thought it was. So she starts to remember and imagine her mother, whose love was unconditional. Unlike Ozai, Ursa didn’t care if Azula was perfect; she loved her regardless of ability. THIS is what made Azula crack in the show: the seed of the idea that she has been living her life by the ideals of the wrong parent. That love doesn’t grow from usefulness. This is why Azula was so conflicted, and this idea has the potential to lead to a very cathartic redemption plot. If Azula finds and confronts her mother, maybe she will come to realize she IS genuinely loved and doesn’t have to live life by her father’s cruel philosophy.When Azula does catch up to her mother, she basically throws some fire around, yells in her mother’s face, and is run off like a cartoon villain. Ursa, not having any memory of Azula, says “I’m sorry if I didn’t love you enough.” Which completely misses the point of Azula’s conflict with her mother. It isn’t that Ursa didn’t love Azula enough; it is that Azula didn’t know how to RECOGNIZE or ACCEPT unconditional love. Likewise, Ursa didn’t spend more time with Zuko because she loved him more, but because of her two children, he was the one much more in need of protection because of his gentle nature (and the fact he was the heir, which made him much more of a target). THESE are the things Azula needs closure on, and THESE are the things that should have been addressed when they finally caught up to Ursa.But not only does Azula never have a conversation with Ursa after she regains her memories, but Ursa never even mentions Azula when she and Zuko have a conversation. Not even to ask where she is or how she is doing. So not only does Azula not get the chance to have a much needed conversation with her mother and explore the conflicting feelings she has been having since the show ended, but we the reader don’t even get the catharsis of hearing Ursa confirm her feelings for Azula are as uncomplicated and loving as we all know them to be.Again, this is a huge disservice not only to Ursa’s character, but to Azula’s as well. Maybe Azula’s arc will conclude in further volumes, but as far as this contained “Search” arc is concerned, Azula’s story is a huge, underwhelming disappointment.While this comic has some good visuals and neat ideas here and there, I think these problems are a huge disservice to basically every character involved. Ursa and Azula deserved better.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18631568-the-search,The Search.txt
The Broken Ear,"Cuando era pequeña, uno de los primeros cómics europeos de los que disfruté fue ‘’Las aventuras de Tintín y Milú’’.Quizás fue una especie de heraldo sobre mi futuro, más o menos, por supuesto: reportero, aventurero, viajero, terrier, malos a su alrededor, portera cotilla y compañeros inseparables para sus aventuras…Habré leído los cómics… no sé, y no siempre por orden o la colección completa. Pero eso es buena señal.Para chicos y adultos, de manera completamente normal, pues de pequeño algunos ya conocen el mal, o muchos. Y el sabor de las aventuras, era el bálsamo para los desagradables malos, que no dejaban de darnos la satisfacción de ser tan tontos como para caer bajo las trampas que Tintín les ponía, con la ayuda de ese ‘’perro’’ que hablaba y me encantaba leer ;)Una narrativa; aunque cómic, es narrativa, muy elaborada, entretenida y educativa: teníamos temas para todos los gustos y de todas las nacionalidades, como he dicho. Había inocencia, suspicacia; había inteligencia y patosidad, había maldad y bondad… Había hasta un alunizaje… Aventuras por cielo, mar y tierra. Diversión, suspense… Un cofre lleno del tesoro llamado ‘Aventura’…Tantos personajes que muchos conocen, que no acabaría de detallarlos si me entrego totalmente…El eterno prota, poco más que un chico que vive tantas experiencias que nunca para quieto. Su tranquilidad y rapidez a la vez en momentos oportunos; así como su flequillo y sus pantalones, marca personal ;) y eternamente acompañado de ese perro que todos adoramos, de seguro, y el que no, que pare de leer aquí… Un ‘animalito’ goloso y a veces algo miedoso… que salvaba a su querido amigo de montones de peligros: ¿cuántas veces no la hubiera contado Tintín de no ser por Milú?... Y a la inversa: hay cada momento en el que te ríes y hasta lloras por lo que hacen el uno por el otro…Luego llega el mal hablado, pero perdonable, del eterno Capitán de barco Haddock. La bebida no era un buen ejemplo, y el agua para él era un insulto; pero ¿quién no se ha partido el pecho con su jerga? ***x#@!!!... Además, tampoco abandonaba a Tintín, incluso con esa poca fe que traía a veces…Los detectives más incompetentes del planeta sólo debían existir para que el tema llegara al punto de partirte del todo: menudos momentazos con ese par de inútiles y a la vez adorables patosos… La de tropiezos, caídas y demás, que no necesitaban de fisio… OMG!! Repeticiones, sombreros y bastones por doquier… La demostración real de que la incompetencia tiene sueldo… pero con todo lo que aportaban, cobraban poco y todo ;)Y el ‘’duro de oído’’ Tornasol, que no admitiría la sordera a no ser por algo alucinante… y aun así.

Tintin in America,"When I first read Hergé'sTintin en Amériquein German translation (asTim in Amerika) as a child (and I guess I must have been about nine or ten years of age), I did indeed find the general storyline somewhat and mildly amusing. But even then (even at that time), I was already thinking that Hergé had been rather strangely loose with his fusing together 1920s-1930s Chicago gangster and organised crime culture with what can only be considered and described as the so-called Wild West (and its utterly stereotypical late 19th century Cowboys and Indians thematics and scenarios). Now the ethnic stereotyping, the cultural insensitivity to Native Americans did not chafe me so much as a child (especially since in Germany at that time, the rather similarly constructed and conceptualised tales of ""Noble Savages"" and especially the stories penned by authors like Karl May were both popular and often readily available as children's novels or in my case, as abridged vinyl record audio recordings of said tales), but already then did I most definitely feel that from a logical point of departure, the details presented inTintin en Amériquedid not really make all that much sense by any stretch of the imagination (and that 1930s Chicago, with its gangs, its prohibition era rum running, with Al Capone and other such villains simply did not fit in any fashion with the Wild West scenarios also depicted, as that was not the early and middle 20th, but the late 19th century).However, rereadingTintin en Amériqueas an older adult (and also as someone who has recently done a bit of research on Native Americans and how they have been and how they are depicted and approached in children's literature), well this story now just makes me utterly and completely cringe and yes, incredibly and lastingly angry. I mean, almost EVERYTHING related to the depictions of Native Americans inTintin en Amériqueis at best culturally insensitive and some of it does not in any way even make all that much logical and common sense. For example, the Native Americans depicted in the book are clearly supposed to be Great Plains tribes (I think they might have been Blackfoots), and thus they would NOT in any way have totem poles (these being coastal West Coast of North America traditions and culture). And while the level of presented and featured colonialism, while the level of paternalism and cultural, ethnic insensitivity encountered inTintin en Amériquemight well and indeed not be quite as singularly horrid and nasty as the previous instalment, as the truly almost viciously vileTintin au Congo(and while I do realise that some readers and literary analysts actually considerTintin en Amériqueas a bit of a satire of and against America), the culturally inappropriate and ethnically stereotyping depictions and descriptions of American Indians, combined with a timeline that simply and utterly fails the test of basic historical logic, these issues are enough for me to only consider but one star forTintin en Amériqueand to declare the book as not really to be recommended except for Tintin completists or for academic research and critical analysis purposes. For even if Hergé might have indeed wanted to present a critical condemnation of the exploitation of American Indians by corrupt business and governmental interests, one cannot really achieve this by using the very instruments of subjugation and cultural appropriation that have angered Native Americans since forever (and with good reason), one cannot really achieve this by portraying American Indians as cardboard one-dimensional ethnic stereotypes at best.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/790192.Tintin_in_America,Tintin in America.txt
King Ottokar's Sceptre,"Sometimes life takes over. And life is still here, and it’s not going anywhere. But my copies of Tintin have been sitting there, still looking at me, wondering why I stopped my in-depth exploration of their content in 2022. Michael Farr’s companion is still there as well. What isn’t there, perhaps, is the patience I had when I was writing my other reviews on the first 7 volumes. But I want to continue the deep reading. It’s time forKing Ottokar's Sceptre.Last time around (inThe Black Island), we were in Scotland. This time, we are in Syldavia. Quick stop over in Prague and we are off. I remember this volume being “meh” when I was a kid. Isn’t that just apt? The political intrigues happening in the background bored me. I found the actual chases in car and on foot to be the most exciting parts of this adventure. Slightly different now.I have appreciated learning more about the historical and political backdrop of this story. Hergé was writing this while Hitler was going about the Anschluss and annexing Austria. At the same time, we had the handiwork of naive Neville Chamberlain. We also had a host of other tensions in the region, including a focus on Slovakia, Czechoslovakia, and finally, Poland. Why is this relevant? Tintin travels to the fictional Syldavia (itself inspired by various nations in the region, which included Poland and Albania), and his adventure is focused almost exclusively on stopping a fascist takeover of Syldavia by the neighbouring (and equally fictional) Borduria. Farr mentions the following:“So, on September 1, 1939, just three weeks after the Syldavian adventure concluded with Tintin saving the kingdom from a fascist takeover, Nazi tanks rolled over the Polish border and began Hitler’s well-planned Blitzkrieg, provoking the Second World War. Despite hopelessly valiant resistance, Poland was crushed in less than a month. Once again world events had been anticipated by Hergé with extraordinary insight.”I’ll continue to quote from Farr:Asked years later by Numa Sadoul about his creation of Borduria, Hergé noted that there were in this adventure “insignia that very clearly denoted the SS.”“At the time,” he continued, “Germany was of course in mind; Ottokar’s Sceptre is nothing other than the tale of a failed Anschluss. But one can take it to be any other totalitarian regime. Colonel Sponsz appears as well to be typically German, an Erich von Stroheim type. Moreover, isn’t the villain of Ottokar’s Sceptre called Müsstler, evidently a combination of Mussolini and Hitler? It strikes me as a clear allusion.”The Syldavian landscape itself is wonderfully quaint. I found a picture of Farr’s book online and I put it here now, as I am far too lazy to take a picture myself and upload it:You can clearly see the inspirations for Hergé’s characters. The Syldavian lemonade seller is an almost exact replica of a Macedonian lemonade seller.As Tintin is flying out to Syldavia with Professor Alembick, he reads a brochure about the nation on the flight. A standout moment of the book for me personally, as we are introduced to some history and myth, specificallyThe Battle of Zileheroum:This is “in the style of Persian miniatures of the [XVth century] with a flattened perspective and rather balletic warriors prancing, or elegantly lying dead, between pretty flowers and trees”.Of course, the creation of Syldavia (and Borduria) was too useful for Hergé, as it was a direct one-to-one parallel to what continued to unfold in the real world. So we will come back to this location in a few other adventures.Finally, a very important canon character is introduced: Signora Bianca Castafiore of La Scala, Milan. She will be with us for the remainder of the series, more or less (even lending her name to one of my favourite late adventures). When I was a kid, I used to think that her singing was horrible, because that’s truly how Hergé depicts his characters’ reactions to Castafiore’s singing. Turns out, not necessarily – it’s just top level opera, and as Hergé mentioned, “Opera bores me, to my great shame. What’s more, it makes me laugh”. Okay. That makes more sense.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/146108.King_Ottokar_s_Sceptre,King Ottokar's Sceptre.txt
Destination Moon,"Tintin was one of the comic book heroes of my childhood. I'm going to read my way through the series again as I listen to a radio program about him, and his creator, Hergé. After one stand alone book, Land of Black Gold, comes the next two book adventure, and as it turned out, the last one. First Destination Moon (Tintin #16) and then Explorers on the Moon (Tintin #17). Destination Moon actually begins right where Land of Black Gold left off, so perhaps one could talk about a three book adventure, but not really. There is single story line from the beginning of Destination Moon, till the end of Explorers on the Moon.The story begins when Tintin, Snowy and Captain Haddock come back from their oil crisis mission, but Professor Calculous isn't at home. Before they manage to unpack, a telegram arrives. It is from the professor, and he is asking them to join him in Syldavia. They go there, and find out that the professor is building a rocket to take a manned, and dogged mission to the moon.While it doesn't use quite the same formula as the two previous two book adventures, that is mystery at home in Belgium, and then a adventure somewhere else, it doesn't go far from it. There is a certain mystery in Destination Moon, and then adventure in Explorers on the Moon. So there is a clear similarity between these three two book adventures.But what's more is that after one not so great book, Hergé gets back to form, and delivers a good, tight story, filled with humour, mystery, and adventure. Professor Calculus is responsible for quite a few jokes in Destination Moon, but in a sense this is the first time that he comes across as something more than the dotty professor. He is much more competent here than usually, and in a way this two book adventure is his adventure. This is where he is in his element.Thompson and Thomson show up, much to the readers amusement, and there is connection between Land of the Black Gold and this two book adventure is mostly seen through them. They still suffer slightly from the mysterious, and comic illness that they contracted in that book. It is a funny book, and there is also an good mystery that isn't quite solved at the end of it, but it really draws one in.This story was first published in book form in 1953, having been published in weekly instalments as a magazine comic in 1950. The first actual trip to the moon was in 1969, so there had a fair bit of time passed from the time Hergé penned his vision of this trip. Still it's not quite a shot in the dark. He used ideas that had been proposed at the time for how this could be done. The book even has a blue print of the rocket, which gives it a authentic science fiction air.All in all this is a great book, and ends on probably the best cliffhanger in all the Tintin books.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/179172.Destination_Moon,Destination Moon.txt
The Calculus Affair,"My review as published inTintin Books.There's a vague consensus amongst fans and critics that ""The Calculus Affair"" is Herge's greatest creation. Well, in some ways that's true, but things aren't perhaps quite as clear cut.The plot is really quite simple: Calculus invents a new technology with possible weapons applications; he is kidnapped by agents from Syldavia and/or Borduria; his friends must save him. It's the plot ofPrisoners of the Sunset in the richer locale ofKing Ottokar’s Sceptre, in a nutshell.Where ""The Calculus Affair"" triumphs is in the artwork: never before had Herge's work been so exquisitely rendered. Everything from the crowded Bordurian streets at evening, to the pink skies of sunset and the European vistas. (Perhaps, despite all of Herge's meticulous research, this suggests that photographs have nothing on experience after all?) One suspects that after the colourless emptiness of space inExplorers on the Moon, Herge relished the challenge to draw scenes bursting with life again. Some of his half-page frames (the crowd outside Marlinspike's gates, a Bordurian town) are lush and joyous.Again, though, there's nothing in the plot that distinguishes this from the serialised comic strip that it was. The album breaks up rather neatly into quarters: first, a string of strange scientific anomalies with no explanation (which last perhaps too long), then an uneasy tour of Geneva, followed by a dash of political intrigue, and then a chase sequence. This had been done numerous times before, and he didn't really make any special attempt here to make the basics of the plot unique. However, I believe this to be the beginning of his late period, in which the following 5 completed works would either transform the ""Tintin"" formula for their own ends, or dash it completely. Here, what elevates ""The Calculus Affair"" is in the beauty, the atmosphere, and the interconnectedness.From the opening page, there is a strong sense of foreboding with more than one mysterious figure stalking our heroes, and this unease fills the pages relentlessly until the opera sequence, where we're dashed into a chase narrative to climax the work. And the plot is overarching whilst also using our characters to their fullest. Various dangers loom in and out of the frame, but their motives remain consistent and it never feels as if one villain is simply replacing another in a tired formula. Also, Herge subtracts the comedy of the Thompsons (and even Calculus and Snowy, neither of whom appears for any length of time), but gives us the brilliantly blabbering Jolyon Wagg in their stead. (Wagg instantly proves himself a marvelous foil to the Captain, since - unlike many leading men of comics - Tintin is never annoyed at anyone, so can only be outraged by villainy.) Not to mention a certain infamous piece of sticking plaster...As always, there are a couple of useless elements, but only a couple, primarily involving the cliffhangers. When the cliffhanger is ""how will they survive this?"" and the answer is just ""oh! they survived!"", it's not really good enough. Herge at his best didn't like to show the strings - note his touches of realism in explaining why Tintin and Haddock found disguises so easily, or why it is that Tintin can drive a tank - but on a few of the later pages, this gets lost. (And there is some outright silliness when Tintin drives over some mines in terror, and then we learn that the mines must have been duds. For a three-frame episode, it seems redundant.)Perhaps this will lose a little something for children of today, who know little of an era of mounting European tensions, but then again I hope not. While Borduria very much relies on comparisons with the central Europe of the time, it comes alive and the politics within work on their own terms.Artistically, this is an outright triumph. In terms of plot construction and consistency, it is really no more than an engrossing political conspiracy movie, but it stands on an equal footing with the surrounding albums. ""The Calculus Affair"" is an example of what Herge could achieve when he was working at full creativity and with great resources, and for that it deserves five stars.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6443100-the-calculus-affair,The Calculus Affair.txt
Le Lotus bleu,"Tintin was one of the comic book heroes of my childhood. I'm going to read my way through the series again as I listen to a radio program about him, and his creator, Hergé. This book and the book before it, Cigars of the Pharaoh, contain one single adventure where Tintin fights drug lords that are using a specialised drug to make their enemies crazy. At the beginning of The Blue Lotus, Tintin travels with his faithful Snowy to China to continue what he started in Cigars of the Pharaoh.This is the first really good Tintin book. It wouldn't be fair to compare it to Tintin in the Land of the Soviets because that one was never redrawn, but if we compare it to Tintin in the Congo one can see how great the difference is. There are only two books between those two volumes, Tintin in America, and Cigars of the Pharaoh, but one can see how much Hergé has matured as a story teller in the time that passed between the two books.One of the reasons why is that this is the first time he really took it upon himself to research the place he was writing about, the culture, the history and so on, and one can see it in the story. The depth is much greater in The Blue Lotus. Sure, there is still a lot of the silly cliffhanger stuff that one can see in the earlier book, and Tintin gets out of some scraps a little too easily, but the character has evolved, the story is stronger, and one can read it as an middle aged man and still see interesting things in the way he builds this up. I don't think I noticed the difference in depth as much when I read this as a kid as I do now for example.Racism is one of the big problems with Tintin in the Congo, and there is still some racism in this book. If one looks at the Japanese characters, one realised quite quickly that they are all buck toothed and evil. The Chinese characters are drawn completely different, they are characters, while the Japanese are caricatures. This is quite simply racism, and it is the same racism that one can see in the World War 2 propaganda cartoons featuring Japanese people. Those have the exactly the same stereotypes, and the fact is that The Blue Lotus is written around the same time as Japan invaded China. Hergé's sympathy lay with China as he had by the time he wrote this book a Chinese friend by the name of Zhang Chongren, who is written into the book in a way.So there is racism in this book, but Hergé writes into this story also an interesting discussion about racism between Tintin and his new found friend Zhang. Hergé hadn't done this kind of thing before in his work. As racial stereotypes of Chinese people where quite common at the time, in earlier Tintin volumes also, it is quite interesting that he would go against the grain here to show the other side. And this is not the only thing. He shows how complicated the impact of the international politics was on this conflict between China and Japan. It's not just the Japanese that are villainous. It is a complicated conflict.It is also just a fun comic book. Thomson and Thompson continue their roles as the comic relief, and in fact they take pretty much over the role from Snowy who remains more or less silent through out this book. Even though Hergé takes the time to discuss racism, in this book it is never really didactic. It is there for those that want to look into it, but mostly it is a exciting adventure story, and it is pretty well built up. Among the better of the series.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89321.Le_Lotus_bleu,Le Lotus bleu.txt
Tintin in the Land of the Soviets,"Tintin was one of the biggest chunks of my childhood. I had all 24 books, which my mother graciously and patiently purchased for me, one by one, sometimes multiple volumes at a time, because I couldn’t help myself. I have individual memories associated with each of them. It’s hard not to, when you reread a series so many times. One of the mass appeals of Tintin for me was the fact that I could go absolutely anywhere in the world with him – the sea, the air, Europe, Asia, North and South America, and even the moon. I have read the series as a whole no fewer than 50 times, with the vast majority of that number being in Persian, but a few in English as well. It’s been at least 13 or 14 years since I’ve done a proper run through, and I think I’m ready to embark on the journey again. Let’s see what memories are pulled out of the vault, if any. Throughout it, I will be using Michael Farr’sTintin: The Complete Companion. There is something so joyful in being able to read a work deeper, when that work is emotionally charged and holds an important place in your heart.As Farr mentions, the perfectionist tendencies of Hergé and his attention to detail were key aspects of the longevity of Tintin. “By devising a character who would appeal to children as much as grown-ups, though for often quite different reasons, Hergé struck gold… In fact the appeal has proved much wider: from children first learning to read to aged Tintinophiles… The child will be gripped by the excitement of Tintin, the comedy, even farce. The adult will additionally find political satire and parody, puns and prescience. The most dedicated Tintinologist, as he or she may be called, may have read the stories any number of times and still discover something new: they bear repeated rereading. The adventures, like their hero, are inexhaustible.” Amen.We begin with Tintin prowling around in Soviet Russia, on a mission to report for his newspaper, Le Petit Vingtième. This first volume is decidedly less spectacular than the ones that follow, in both story and art. There are far too many setbacks for Tintin for it to feel like a smooth adventure, and you can clearly tell that Hergé has not found his feet with the drawings. Farr puts it perfectly: “Most notably the very first Tintin adventures lack a pre-planned scenario, instead a high degree of last minute improvisation propels the action from one scene to the next.” Published in 1929, this first book draws heavily onMoscou sans voiles(Moscow Unveiled), a book written by Joseph Douillet and detailing the daily lives of people in Soviet Russia and the doings of the Bolsheviks. The highlights of this book are lifted from Douillet’s book: an election episode, in which the communist party remains in power with the use of guns by officials to intimidate the “voting public”, and a tour of the “Potemkin factories, where industrial activity is simulated by burning straw” for the benefit of “gullible British trade unionists”. The latter image has remained with me for years – honestly. The commissar is pointing to the smoking chimney stacks behind him, saying: “Contrary to the tales put out by the bourgeois nations, our factories work to full capacity!” Meanwhile, the British delegates look on, murmuring “Beautiful” or “Very nice”, while smoking pipes and wearing tweed jackets.The next few panels show what is really going on – the factory setups are cardboard (I am assuming a convincing painting of the outer views), a stack of hay is being burned for each “chimney”, and the noise coming from the factories is man-made, but it’s a person deliberately banging some pieces of metal to make the whole act convincing.Hergé was not the biggest fan of this volume, and only allowed for it to be included in collections of Tintin books in 1973. Later Tintin books come to showcase meticulous research and accuracy (the agenda and colonialist paradigms, however, as we will see with the second volume, does not necessarily always go away). Either way, it, like most other Tintin books, remains a rich source of historical facts, details, propaganda, and imagery. A nice depiction of Brussels’ Gare du Nord station ends our first adventure.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/87424.Tintin_in_the_Land_of_the_Soviets,Tintin in the Land of the Soviets.txt
Tintin and Alph-Art,"My Review:(from theTintin Booksgroup.(Part 1: the authorised version)""Tintin and Alph-Art"" remains on the edge of the ""Tintin"" ouevre for good reason: it was never finished, and published only as rough sketches with translated dialogue beside them. (Herge's estate chose not to complete the work, as part of a larger understanding from Herge that he didn't want his studio to carry on the series after his death.) In some ways, this is a pity. For while the acknowledged final album,Tintin and the Picaros, fittingly caps Tintin's travelogues - with disturbingly real consequences, and deconstruction of existing characters - ""Alph-Art"" proves a fitting end to the story of Tintin himself.""Alph-Art"" takes many of the existing tropes of Herge's repertoire to new heights. The opening dream sequence is pitch-perfect, and Herge's interest in farce is taken to new - and well-mannered - heights when Haddock, admiring his new art purchase, is accosted within moments by Tintin, Calculus, the Thompsons, Nestor and Wagg. (Oddly, Wagg seems to come to Marlinspike solely for his part in this comic bit...)The central mystery is simple enough: avoiding Castafiore, Haddock ducks into an art gallery where he finds himself taken with 'Alph-Art' in which letters of the alphabet are moulded in various materials. However, this new interest propels the Captain and Tintin toward the mysterious deaths of several art experts. It's genuinely fascinating, and reminiscent of '60s/'70s mystery television, more than it is of the adventure serials that characterise the earlier works.The second half of the mystery involves a mystic, Endaddine Akass, who has charmed both the beautiful young art gallery assistant, and La Castafiore herself. This mysterious man reminds Tintin of someone, but he can't quite tell who. The scenes at Akass' ritual are genuinely unnerving, and it's clear that Tintin has met his match in this seemingly placid villain.As the two cases begin to wind together, Haddock and Tintin find themselves travelling to an island of Naples, where Akass' friends have gathered - among them are many characters who have populated earlier works in the series. (Even more so than ""Picaros"", there is a distinct sense of a final recap here) It is only when Tintin puts the pieces together - that Akass is flooding the art market with fakes while raising his own profile with the help of the 'Alph-Art' movement - that the boy reporter is caught, and led to his likely death...The official release of ""Alph-Art"" is a beautiful volume, doing the best they can with Herge's pencil rough sketches of the story. There's a lot to learn here, seeing how the latter pages - much rougher than the earlier ones - still are clearly numbered, and it seems likely that this is roughly the pattern the first two-thirds of the work would've taken. (It fits the usual Tintin album profile, with one-third devoted over to the mystery, the second to a chase sequence, and then the third to the denouement.)While the story itself is nothing breathtaking, the more 'mature' choice of setting is most satisfying for those of us who grew up with Tintin, and are now grown-up ourselves. Beyond this, Herge's style still seems to be maturing: Haddock is still off alcohol after the events of the previous story, for instance. Most interestingly, for me, there are several strong female characters - a first for a ""Tintin"" album. Beyond La Castafiore, there are the two art gallery staff members - one of whom is crucial to the case, and a young, beautiful woman for once. Then Castafiore's friend Angelina, although she appears rarely, maeks quite an impact. (One wonders, though, if Herge would've amended the line where Tintin calls the elder secretary a ""shrew""?)As for whether Akass is Rastopopoulous: well, in the original draft sketches (shown at the end of this volume), he clearly is. And quite frankly, this odd-looking villain has to be in disguise, and no one else would use such a James Bond villain mindset in his crimes. The rediscovered pages are very interesting, as they show - however briefly - the way Herge's mind worked as he developed the plot for a story, and mention an original idea for the plot in which Haddock completely loses all trace of himself as he becomes an art yuppie - only to be saved when Calculus develops a pill to restore him to alcoholism!There's something nostalgic and undeniably 'modern' about ""Alph-Art"" as Herge envisioned it, particularly with the many other characters he had considered bringing back. I'll give some comments on the unofficial completed version (by Canadian artist Yves Rodier) in the next post, but in some ways, this ends more fittingly than any completed album could. Tintin, our globetrotting boy reporter, is taken away to have another brush with death. We know that Tintin must surely be immortal, and so is it not perfect that we last see him facing the wrath of a recurring villain for one final time? And beyond that, he is not just being led to his death - he's being taken to be encased in a mould and sold to collectors. In short, Tintin is about to become an immortal work of art.(Part 2: the unauthorised version)Canadian artist Yves Rodier is among those who decided to complete this album - against the wishes of Herge's estate. Honestly? I approve. Although I waxed lyrical about how fitting Tintin's unending end is, I'd love to see this completed. Herge had not wanted the studio to go on making ""Tintin"" albums after his death, and I respect that. But this was already mostly completed, so I'm glad to have read Rodier's version.Rodier's animation is lovely. Certainly, it doesn't bring quite the depth that Herge could give, but it's a great companion to the original artist and - most importantly - doesn't try to be post-modern or revisionist. Indeed, for the first 40 pages, Rodier basically copies Herge's draft intentions to the letter, adding only a few frames where an additional joke or clarification is necessary.As we reach the final third of the work, Rodier takes things to their logical conclusion, but via some wonderful character-based detours. Rastopopolous (as all villains do in ""Tintin"") has gathered together a group of followers who happen to have met Tintin. After he survives his near-death experience thanks to Snowy and Haddock, Tintin must rely on his extended family to team up and protect him. (Most hilariously, Abdullah joins because if ""Blistering Barnacles"" goes to jail or dies, how can the boy play pranks on him?).After a few enjoyable side-jokes - Allen is now a postman in the States, etc. - Rodier gives us what we want. Rastopopolous and Tintin have a final showdown on a rocky outcrop, watched from below by all of Tintin's closest friends. Everyone from Snowy to the Thompsons gets a moment to shine, and the final pages show us that things have ended for good: the villain is dead, and Haddock is going home, never to leave again. (Of course, this has happened before, so anything is possible...) There's even the first hint in the entire canon that Tintin may be entering a mature, heterosexual relationship - although as ever, he plays his cards close to his chest.The only issue with the edition is that the English translation is not perfect, particularly in the post-Herge pages. Sometimes the dialogue comes across as monosyllabic and underwritten, but it's a minor concern.I cherish all 24 albums in this series, even those whose plot or twists I don't hold in high esteem. And while I appreciate having Herge's original sketches and thoughts thanks to the authorised version, I'm glad Rodier took the time and great pains to produce this. To see the characters of ""Tintin"" one last time was a joy. Here's hoping that - one day - Herge's estate may incorporate this into the official canon. Rodier is never disrespectful to the original intent, and for that, we should all be grateful.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/146127.Tintin_and_Alph_Art,Tintin and Alph-Art.txt
The Red Sea Sharks,"Tintin returns to the Middle East25 February 2012Once again I simply underestimated Herge's ability to be able to exceed the benchmark that he set with his previous comic, and while the Red Sea Sharks, in the way of comedy, is probably nowhere near as farsical as the Calculus Affair, this comic still manages to raise the bar. An interesting note is that at this stage it appears that Herge is beginning to slow down on the production of comics that had pretty much been a mainstay for the previous three decades, and from here there are only another four that he produced. However, come 1959, we encounter the first of another series of classic European comics: Asterix and Obelix. However, these are another series that I will consider a little down the track, and may be ones that I would also like to read (once again being a mainstay of my childhood) but in some ways, while not wanting to underrate Asterix, I feel that they do not come close to Herge's brilliance.The Red Sea Sharks is about the illegal arms and slave trade. This is not the first comic that deals with arms smuggling (though the Broken Ear deals with a more legitimate aspect of the trade, that being made by legal corporations – as Amnesty International demonstrates, the worlds biggest arms dealers today each occupy seats on the UN security council). One noticeable thing about corporate arms dealers though is that on the surface they only interact with governments and armies and can be restricted in who they sell too, however asMark Thomaspoints out in his bookAs Used on Nelson Mandelaarms trades can include the sale of troop carriers, which enable tyranical governments to better oppress their people.After a night on the town the Captain and Tintin return to Marlinspike to discover that Prince Abdullah has been sent to stay with them after a revolt in Kemed has left his father without a throne and hiding in the mountains. The short period in Marlinspike is simply farcical, with all of the Marlinspike jokes coming thick and fast, as well as all of the annoying practical jokes that Abdullah plays. There is also Cuthburt with another strange invention, and also being as absent minded as usual. As there is an adventure on the horizon, Tintin convinces the Captain that maybe travel to the middle east is in store. Much to his disappointment (the Captain really does not seem to like adventures, he is getting a little too old) he realises that an adventure is going to be much better than putting up with the antics of Abdullah and Cuthbert.The comedy slows down a bit once they leave Europe, however much of it is tied to the fact that Captain Haddock is not much of an adventurer. In one instance they are forced to travel across country in the middle of the night to escape patrols and poor of Captain Haddock just simply cannot stay awake. However it is what Herge has sitting behind the scenes that makes this such a fascinating story. Obviously there is the arms trade, but as they discuss the arms trade it is also revealed that slaves are being traded as well, and the method is nothing short of genius.The gangsters are offering poor muslims from Sub-Saharan Africa the opportunity to take a pilgrimage to Mecca, but when they arrive at Mecca they are sold off as slaves never to be seen by their friends and family again. However they are blinded by their Islamic faith in that while it is eventually revealed to them their fate, they are torn between their duty to make the pilgrimage and the knowledge that they will never actually arrive. The way Herge paints these innocent Muslims is almost heart-wrenching. Some might suggest racism, but I do not think so because I do not see this as a criticism against Islam but rather the callousness of those who seek to use people's faith to further their own gain. Unfortunately this happens far too much, particularly in some elements of the Christian Church (though I note that Herge tends not to bring Christianity into his comics). Sometimes I wonder, with the beautiful detail that he puts into this comic, whether he was Muslim himself, but that is unclear. What we do know is that he went to extra-ordinary lengths to understand and bring a culture to us the reader.In this comic a number of re-occurring villains return. We have Dawson fromThe Blue Lotus, Muller fromLand of the Black Gold, Mr Mate from a number of comics, and of course, the Marquis di Gorgonzolla (whom I will not name). This is not the end of some of these characters, but it seems that they are all returning to confront Tintin and his meddling ways. All in all this is a brilliant comic, and with many similar books and stories, it is something I am going to miss once I have finished the final four.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/165526.The_Red_Sea_Sharks,The Red Sea Sharks.txt
The Secret of the Unicorn,"Tintin was one of the comic book heroes of my childhood. I'm going to read my way through the series again as I listen to a radio program about him, and his creator, Hergé. After a few standalone books comes this adventure that spans two books, (books 11 and 12), The Secret of the Unicorn, and Red Rackham's Treasure. The Secret of the Unicorn begins with Tintin finding a model ship in a market. He buys it, and wants to give it to the captain, but things don't go to plan, the ship gets stolen.I think these two Tintin books are the best of the series, or at least up there with the very best. The two books are different, but everything works in both of them. I think they may be the perfect Tintin adventure, even though The Secret of the Unicorn is the first book in the series where Tintin spends the entire book in Belgium. It is a different kind of adventure from the usual glob trotting Boy Scout we usually get.In some sense The Secret of the Unicorn is closer to a mystery than adventure. There is a theft, or perhaps more accurately, there are committed two seemingly unrelated crimes. First there is the theft of the model ship, which Tintin starts to investigate, and soon realises that behind that theft there is something deeper. At the same time Thomson and Thompson are investigating a series of pick pocketing. The two cases don't seem to have anything in common, but of course the two will eventually prove to be connected.As a mystery I think it works quite well. It draws the reader from one clue to the next, and does so fairly logically. And one gradually realises what is going on. By the time Hergé wrote this one, he had become a good writer. This isn't the barely connected cliffhangers that one got in the first few books, but a plot that well thought out.This is obviously a children's book, and they are not just about the adventure. The other angle of the Tintin formula is the humour. He mixes these two elements together in the books to various degree. Here he does a good job with mixes these elements together into a great cocktail. Thomson and Thompson are in good comic form, but the humour doesn't just rest on them, but also on Tintin, Snowy, Captain Haddock, and other characters. At the same time none of these characters are there just for the humour, even Thomson and Thompson get their moments where they show something else. It all just works wonderfully together in this volume.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/179174.The_Secret_of_the_Unicorn,The Secret of the Unicorn.txt
"The Sandman, Vol. 1: Preludes & Nocturnes","Since joininggoodreads, I’ve been baffled by theNeil Gaimanlove fest.American Gods,Neverwhere,Stardust,The Graveyard Book, they appear to be universally loved, and I’ve been skeptical of this emotion that borders on worship. These books are good and all, and I recognize their general accessibility, but I don’t personally find any of them mind blowing literature. Gaiman’s prose is no match forChina Mieville’s orIain M. Banks’ orUrsula LeGuin’s (and countless others who write speculative fiction), and the way he recasts mythology into contemporary settings is more clever than inspired. The love accorded Gaiman, therefore, feels disproportionate to the quality of his work – at least to me.Lately, however, I’ve been reminded that I once lovedNeil Gaiman, and that reminder was my return toThe Sandman Preludes and Nocturnes. Like his other fine work,The Wolves in the Walls, The Sandman series plays to Gaiman’s greatest strength: his ability to conjure beautiful images from artists. But it also elevates many of the things that Gaiman is usually only able to do adequately. His writing, when confined by thought and dialogue bubbles, is inspired (mostly because its goal is to be natural and believable rather than aspiring to literary greatness); his contemporizing of mythology is much more palatable (happening, as it does, in a comic book universe predisposed to gods and heroes); and his naturally cinematic pacing works better in a graphic format. Yes, indeed...graphic novels are Neil Gaiman’s best form.Sleep of the Just– This may be the greatest first issue of a comic ever written. The capture of Morpheus/Dream/Sandman (or whichever name of his you prefer), the sleeping sickness, his inevitable (and beautifully patient) escape and vengeance guarantees that any fan of fantasyorcomic books or fantasyandcomic books must continue with the series. Even better, though,Sleep of the Justcould have been its own stand-alone issue, and that would have been good enough. There are few single issues of a comic that are so fulfilling. I buy it all, and everything Ihadto know was given to me. Luckily, Gaiman left me with plenty beyond what I wanted to know. My personal favourite: the introduction of Sandman’s helm. Killer.Imperfect Hosts– A kick ass follow up episode that includes a taste of Sandman’s powers, the characters that populate his Dreamworld, and the beginning of his search for the three artefacts stolen when Burgess captured him instead of Death. This episode is most notable, however, for the way Gaiman weaves his Sandman into the existing universe of DC. I am not a DC fan. I readBatmanandSupermanbecause they are cultural requirements, and what I know of the DC Universe is filtered through the pages of those books, but Sandman was a rare piece that warped and wefted its way into the DC universe without letting itself get bogged down in DC’s usual shabbiness.Imperfect Hostsis where this all begins to happen.Dream A Little Dream of Me– A weakened and vulnerable Morpheus is busy looking for his sandbag, the first of the three stolen artefacts that can restore him to his former splendour and power. So he tracks down John Constantine, theHellblazer, who bought the sandbag years before and put it into storage, but the sandbag is gone, stolen by Constantine’s ex-lover, Rachel, a heroin addict who needed money for a fix. She never got it; instead, the sandbag took control of her mind, throwing her into a forever nightmare that included the transformation of her father into a room sized, living, breathing, tortured, mass of flesh.Dream a Little Dream of Meis a horror show that hints at the depths of nightmare Dream will combat in future issues, and it embeds Morpheus more deeply into the DC Universe. It’s a satisfying chapter in Morpheus’ rebirth, and this is where the patient build towards the story’s literary quality begins.A Hope In Hell– This is the one issue that really doesn’t thrill me too much. Morpheus goes to Hell and meets up with Lucifer, Beelzebub and Azazel – Hell’s triumvirate of Dark Lords – demanding the return of his helm. He ends up dueling Choronzon for his helm in a ""reality"" battle. Each takes a turn in the shape or form or concept of something or other. Each incarnation is slightly tougher than the opponent’s until the victor’s incarnation can’t be beat. Morpheus defeats Choronzon as ""hope,"" which totally sucks. Hope?! Please. I can see hope as a stage in the battle, perhaps, but as the ultimate incarnation of victory? No way. Hope can be good, but it’s also an emotion that can derail thought and action -- and that makes hope potentially bad and self-defeating. Still, Lucifer was cool and his parting words about Dream give us plenty to look forward to in the series to come: “One day, my brothers...One day I shall destroy him.”Passengers– A creepy start to the search for Morpheus’ last artefact – the Ruby of Dreams. A decrepit Doctor Destiny is sufficiently mad when he escapes Arkham Asylum, Morpheus runs into J’onn and Scott Free from the JLI, and the Doctor Destiny corrupted Ruby throws Morpheus into a catatonic stupor on the floor of a storage garage in the middle of nowhere, all setting the stage for the most terrifying chapter of Volume One:24 Hours– Bloody, nasty, marvelous. Dreams in the hand of a corrupted man become corruption, and the whole Earth suffers. This is the best issue of The Sandman in Preludes and Nocturnes, so I'll let it speak for itself. But be warned: this one is not for the faint hearted.Sound and Fury– This is a satisfying resolution to Dream’s return to power. Sandman shows John Dee mercy, he bestows the Earth with a night of pleasant dreams, and he returns to his Dreamscape to rebuild his kingdom. It’s not quite as powerful as24 Hours, but it does what it needs to do.The Sound of Her Wings– Death is a beautiful thing. If there were no other reason to love Neil Gaiman, this realization would be enough because Deathreally isa beautiful thing -- both in the comic and at the end of our livesI’m glad I revisited Gaiman's greatest moment. Maybe now I can enjoy his new stuff more and appreciate him as much as so many of my friends do.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23754.The_Sandman_Vol_1,"The Sandman, Vol. 1 Preludes & Nocturnes.txt"
"Fables, Vol. 2: Animal Farm","After the first volume, I didn't think this series could get any worse.Inmy reviewofFables, Vol. 1: Legends in ExileI complained that Snow White was a terrible heroine. She's the main character and the defacto ruler of Fable Town, but she's also too stupid to live. I thought it was because Bigby Wolf was being set up as the hero, so Snow White was being diminished to flatter him. But in this volume, he's barely involved, and Snow White is stupider than ever.Taking her sister, Rose Red, up to the farm for some sisterly bonding she utterly fails to notice a revolution happening around her. She doesn't think it odd that the ruler she appointed has disappeared. When heads appear stuck on poles, she doesn't bother to think about why. She escapes only because various tertiary charcters arrange for it. And she whines the whole way. She couldn't even control her sister, who was supposedly serving out a punishment for a criminal offense.Meanwhile, instead of filling in details, this volume continues to expose the gaping holes in the world-building. Snow White boasts at the start of the story that Jack and Rose belong to herbody and souland their punishment is whatever she says it is. In the end, the punishment for Jack, who you may remember in the last volume faking a murder, is less than the punishment for Flycatcher, who has been caught eating bugs in public. You might think that's inconsisitent and harsh, but hey,all the revolutionaries get summarily executed with nothing more than a show trialso it could be worse. The books never really makes clear why Snow White has apparently unlimited power over all the fable creatures even though her boss, the Mayor, is allegedly democratically elected.Either way, it's easy to be sympathetic to the revolutionaries on the farm, given that their political system appears to be some kind of totalitarian dictatorship. Snow White appoints the ruler of the farm and dictates where the animals can go and what they can do. That's more than enough to justify a revolt. So why do the revolutionaries keep spouting a load of Marxist rhetoric? All the motivations the book has set up for them are about liberty, not about economic equality. I guess I'm pretty dense, because it took me ages to realise that it's a joke because the volume is called Animal Farm so it's a reference to Orwell'sAnimal Farm. This is absolutely typical of this series so far - cheap jokes are included at the expense of coherent, consistent world-building.I'm just saying, it is incredibly annoying when the characters bang on about the proletariat but the story doesn't have an actual economic system. What proletariat? In what way are the animals of the farm a working class? Are they providing food for the city fables? Are they sweating down mines and in factories providing goods for the city fables? There's no evidence for any of that in the book. In fact, it isn't clear whether the fables have their own currency or whether they're just using American dollars. At the end of the book, Snow White arranges for a magical transformation charm to be laid on a few of the loyalists and says that it coststhe discretionary budget for both fable towns for the rest of the year, and probably the next.What are they paying for? If it's just the services of some witches then why doesn't Snow White just use her unlimited power to command them? And if it's ingredients for spells, where are those coming from and why do they cost so much? It doesn't make any sense!Snow White'smiraculous recovery from a head shotalso annoyed me. The explanation given is that the fables are kept immortal by the belief of all the people who read their stories. Not a bad explanation, Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett have explored that idea in their work as well. But if it's true here, then why didn'tthe three little pigs regenerate after their execution? If the fables are kept in stasis by the power of belief then why did Goldilocks grow up? Why did Pinocchio in the first booknotgrow up? After a moment's thought the answer is obviously: Goldilocks was an adult so that there could be a stupid joke about her fucking Baby Bear. Pinocchio didn't grow up so that there could be a stupid joke about how he'll never get laid. Coherent world-building once again gives way to puerile humour. And while I'm condemning the tasteless jokes, the 'banter' between Rose Red and Snow White about incest was pretty grim as well.Unfunny jokes, unlikeable characters, incoherent setting, there's very little good to say about this series. And the final nail in the coffin was the tendency to include random characters from children's books for no reason whatsoever. There are three pages in which characters fromThe Jungle Bookdo nothing more than greet each other: 'Hello Baloo,' 'Hello Kaa'. Just adding more familiar characters doesn't actually make a story better. If they're not doing anything useful then they should be relegated to the background of one panel.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/167010.Fables_Vol_2,"Fables, Vol. 2 Animal Farm.txt"
"Fables, Vol. 1: Legends in Exile","Fractured faery tales and contemporary reimaginings of the classic fables have proliferated over the last several decades. Perhaps marked by the playfulness of postmodern revisitation, traditional narratives have seemed a ripe harvest for gleaning new meaning from old stock. So with Bill Willingham and Mark Buckingham’sFables, we can’t really find ourselves wowed by the ingenuity of exploring third-millennium expressions of old yarns—after all, it’s not as if it hasn’t been done often and recently. Still, sinceFablesis a wonderful series, its charms must lie elsewhere from the bland ingenuity of simply traveling well-trod roads.Fablesis, plainly stated, a wonderful series. It does indeed follow the figures of numerous traditional faery tales, fables, nursery rhymes, and best-beloved stories. It does indeed give them modern lives. And it does indeed attempt to interpret their predilections through a number of contemporary filters. Its successes in these reinterpretations are varied, with some faring better with some readers than with others—there have been some understandable frustrations with the fates, expressions, and motivations of both female and male characters, depending on what a reader brings to the text.Fablesworks well not just as Story As Story, but as a commentary on the contemporary reader. Obviously, the work says many things about its creators, but just as interesting are the reactions it provokes in its readership—whether joy or frustration or pleasure or groans or interest or rage. When embedded fans of the series will devote their time and energy to incisive critique and critical readings, that is the mark of a worthwhile read.Some readers take issue with some of Willingham’s female characters and their sometimes provincial outlook on life and on male/female natures and interactions. Others find the portrayal of Arabian fables to be stereotyped and representative of the book’s missed opportunities. Others boggle at the treatment of contemporary political matters, whether the abortion question or Israeli foreign policy. It is a powerful work that can elicit such responses from its mature readership and still garner praise from many of its detractors.Fables’ foundation is built on the idea that all the faery tales and nursery rhymes that have been expressed over the centuries in our world are somehow reflections on a multitude of very real other worlds. Worlds in which Snow White and Rose Red live and breathe. Worlds in which the Big Bad Wolf roams around large and hungry. Worlds in which Boy Blue, Red Riding Hood, Beauty and her Beast, Pinocchio, and more each have full lives only hinted at in our own versions of their stories. And circumstances being what they were, these auspicious figures were forced to evacuate their fabled realms and flee here, to the mundane world.Because a grave and merciless Adversary had begun conquering their lands one after another, the fables found themselves escaped to 1600s Europe from where they then made passage to the New World. There, they established in New Amsterdam an enclave they call Fabletown. Protected by numerous spells and wards, Fabletown sits undiscovered in the midst of the growing New York City—and that is where Willingham first deposits the reader, four hundred years later. The fables have grown comfortable in their adopted homeland, leading relatively normal lives and holding jobs. Of course things are more complicated than that, but that is our introduction to what turns out to be a collection of indelible characters.Characterization is one ofFables’ three main strong points. Each fable has his or her or its surface story, the one that may be an amusing take on the legend. Pinocchio is an embittered 400-year-old in the body of a ten-year-old boy. Kind of like Edward Cullen but with a lot less sex. Beast is human most of the time, but begins falling back into his monstrous appearance as his wife’s love for him wanes. Goldilocks, married to Baby Bear, is an activist for interspecies marriage. Prince Charming, having wed Snow White, Cinderella, and Sleeping Beauty is known as the town cad. Amusing, sure, but not much beyond that. And if that was where Willingham left his characters,Fableswould grow stale at a rapid clip.Fortunately, the stories and backstories of these fables pretty quickly begin to show some depth and thought. These are full-bodied individuals whose motives and actions begin to make sense through the perpetual revelation of who they really are. No character remains mere stereotype. And with a single exception (due to personal taste), each of these characters have become dear to me.The second strength of the series is its seemingly endless well of narrative ideas. Willingham continues to bring new and fresh developments to this company of fables and seems to actively eschew any sort of status quo. The series just hit its 100th chapter and Willingham shows no evident signs of flagging. After what seemed to be his first-act climax, I couldn’t be sure where he would take the story. It seemed as if, having wrapped up what probably could have been the series-long conflict, he didn’t have much elsewhere to go and yet even now, we’re seeing new story branches and hints of developments to come. I continue to anticipate a long and fruitful series.The other great strength ofFablesis its art. And while the seventy or so James Jean-painted covers are a mighty beauty to behold, it is Mark Buckingham’s interior design work and character drawing that really pulls the series together. While many of the guest artists do well with what they’re given, I am always thirsty for the series to return to Buckingham’s hands. His art is not flashy in the overly detailed sense that has sometimes been a boon but mostly plagued mainstream books for the last two decades. He is steady and inventive and illustrates these fables with power and grace.Personally, this is one of my favorite books to pick up every time a new collected volume comes out. I anticipate each new arch in the story and am rarely let down. In sixteen volumes (and one prose novel), the book has only been Not Good twice (individual reader frustrations over socio-political matters aside). Unfortunately, one of those books is the reason I have a hard time recommending the series.Because it’s the very first book.It’s pretty aggravating, but the first volume of this otherwise wonderful series—the one in which all the principal characters are introduced—is really just a mediocre book. It holds none of the charm of the later series. Essentially, whenever I do recommend the series (as I am doing now), I have to caveat by saying: “No matter what you think of the first volume, keep going and read the second one. And then the third. It just gets better and better.” Really, the next rough patch doesn’t crop up until volume thirteen,* so that’s a pretty good spread.In any case, if you’re a mature reader, I highly recommendFablesas an entertaining, thoughtful exploration of characters with whom you’re likely familiar in circumstances that are new and fresh.Notes:* I know. Others will point to the Arabian fables volume. Or the Wedding. Or any number of other points that illustrate issues that one may take up they interpret the book. And that’s fair. But, those are judgments on volumes based on personal values, not on the merits of comic-craft and storytelling. Volume thirteen is objectively Not Good,** whether one takes issue with any socio-political matters contained therein or not.** Insofar as anything in the realm of deciding whether or not you like a comic book can actually be considered objectively.[review courtesy ofGood Ok Bad]",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21326.Fables_Vol_1,"Fables, Vol. 1 Legends in Exile.txt"
Tintin in Tibet,"My review, as published atTintin Books:Mention Tintin to any fan over 20, and chances are they'll recallRed Rackham's Treasure, and then ""Tintin in Tibet"". The first - filled with adventure, science, excitement and a tale of pirates - is obvious; the second, not so much.As everyone knows, one of the forces that led to this album's creation was Herge's own personal problems, and haunting dreams of an expanse of never-ending white. Determined to take the series in a new direction, Herge ended up with this work - surely his most emotional and mature. From the very start, Tintin's face is more expressive than we've ever seen him before - whether in joy, fear or anger. And Haddock is allowed to be more mature and stoic at times, befitting the sober side of his character, which works very well.As is constantly touted, this work features no villain nor many recurring characters. It is instead, an emotional - almost spiritual - journey for Tintin. Every single person he meets, from kind sherpa to humble monk, attempts to convince him that his quest is worthless, that his good friend Chang must surely be dead from the plane crash in the Himalayas. Yet he presses on, forcing himself through the endless mountain expanses of Tibet. As things get more isolated, Herge's drawing gets more lush, and he does seem to have revelled in the minimalist opportunities afforded him on this occasion. The early frames - capturing true-to-life shots of Nepal, for instance - are equally well done, but the cap must surely be Haddock's surreal dream sequence of playing chess with a nappy-wearing Calculus!One of the tropes that defines Herge's later work is his willingness to be realistic about the consequences of the adventures. The teddy bear found at the plane crash site is not Chang's, but it doesn't matter: even if Chang survived, no one else did. As the Abbot says, the mountains keep those they take. As a result, Chang's safety seems more uncertain here than Tintin's safety in the previous 19 works combined.Snowy also gets a fair amount to do, which is atypical of the later albums. His fantasy sequences, in which Snowy is taunted by angel and devil versions of himself, are again a stylistic experiment but manage to be a success due to Herge's more mannered use of Tintin's loyal dog. Snowy's actions - be they risking his life, or attempting to save his friends - are as intimately connected to the story as everything else here. This hasn't always been the case, as in many stories he functions as light comic relief, so it is nice to see the dog being used as a plot point but without losing his sprightly characterisation.Other successes include the well-balanced portrayals of the Tibetan monks - humorous and yet earnest in turn; the hilarious shots of Haddock gradually falling behind the explorer's party; - and the frames with Tintin and Chang together at the end. It's popular these days to associate the two as a 'couple' even though we're aware that this was far from Herge's intention. But whether platonic or otherwise, their friendship resonates off the page, again belying Herge's own feelings of lost friendship toward the original 'Chang'.Less successful elements:* Haddock losing faith and then turning back at the last second, happens maybe twice too often. It's very satisfying to see Tintin being the 'irrational' person, for once, but it seems as if - in such a differently-structured adventure - Herge was out of ideas for how to introduce dramatic tension.* Again, Herge's biggest downfall may be one of his biggest strengths: his desire to impart knowledge. Whilst waiting for their transport, Haddock and Tintin go sight-seeing. But when it's time to catch the plane, Tintin seems reluctant to leave the architecture behind. Which is a bit frustrating, since earlier he was determined to find his missing-possibly-dead friend as soon as possible!One final thought: Herge seems to be reluctant to ascribe an age to Tintin. He starts out on holiday with the Captain, still as the earnest reporter. By album's end, he is constantly being referred to as a young boy and the scenes in the cave - see page 57 - show him at the most boyish he has ever looked!All in all, ""Tintin in Tibet"" is surely a four-and-a-half star work. In keeping with his humanist philosophy, Herge rightly draws the Yeti as a figure of pathos : a lonely being unable to truly help his ward. The artist experiments further with his surrealist dream sequences, and manages finally to produce emotion from a character who has been an audience cipher for nineteen albums now. On top of this, distanced from the wide cast of characters who have populated the last half-dozen albums, Herge creates something decidedly different. I'll concede it is not my favourite - possibly it is number 5 or 6 in my estimation. After all, the first quarter is the inevitable build-up, and in terms of plot, Herge is reduced to recycling through two or three different beats. (To his credit, they seem realistic every time). But as an emotional exercise, and as a work of art, this is surely a contender for Tintin's most human adventure. (And any story that can end with Haddock being given the nickname ""Rumbling Thunderblessings"" must be given some credit!)",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/87425.Tintin_in_Tibet,Tintin in Tibet.txt
Red Rackham's Treasure,"Tintin was one of the comic book heroes of my childhood. I'm going to read my way through the series again as I listen to a radio program about him, and his creator, Hergé. Red Rackham's Treasure begins right where The Secret of the Unicorn ends. Tintin, and Captain Haddock now have a treasure map, and intend to go look for what they can find.In my opinion, the two books that make up this adventure, are the best in the whole series, or at least up until this point. Part of the reason is that there are no problems reading the story from page one in the first book until the last page of this book. It works as a single story, and it shows how far Hergé had got with his craft by that time.But I think they also work because they are very different, and compliment one another. While The Secret of the Unicorn was a mystery set int Belgium, Red Rackham's Treasure is an adventure tale, where our two heroes go looking for a pirate treasure in southern seas. The plot moves briskly, but still logically, and there isn't as much silliness as in some of the volumes. There are perhaps more exciting storylines in some of the other volumes, but the whole thing still keeps moving at a good pace, and is interesting enough to keep one turning the pages.The other part of the Tintin Formula is the humour, and there our cast is in excellent shape. Just as it was in The Secret of the Unicorn, the humour doesn't rest on one character, or a pair of them. Thomson and Thompson come along for the ride, and they are in quite a good comic form, but humour also rests on the all the main cast, Tintin, Captain Haddock, and Snowy all have their comic moments.There is one more character who shoulders quite a bit of the humour burden, and that is Professor Calculous, the last of the usual cast of the Tintin books to appear. Even though there have been some dotty professors now and then up until this book, this is the first where Professor Calculous appears. Captain Haddock and Professor Calculous trying to talk to one another is absolutely wonderful. They make such a great comic duo on occasions.There is one thing though. One thread isn't tied off at the end, and one could argue this is a flaw to the otherwise perfect two-book Tintin adventure, but there is a reason for this flaw. Hergé intended to use this at some point in the series. The idea was even to make this a recurring thread that might pop up now and then in the rest of the series, but then he never found the right angle for it in any of the books. So a flaw, but one that had its reasons.I think I'm remembering this correctly when I say this was my favourite Tintin adventure when I first read the books, and I still think it is the best of the series, or at least up until this book. Lets see how the other half of the series turns out.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/146109.Red_Rackham_s_Treasure,Red Rackham's Treasure.txt
Flight 714 to Sydney,"My review, as published atTintin Books:For a man who has been criticised (fairly or not) for sexism, padding of stories and racism to (among others) Africans, Jews, Native Americans, Japanese, Russians and Indians, it's amusing to think that his most controversial work amongst fans is probably ""Flight 714"", the penultimate completed adventure in the series. But, on re-reading, you can count me amongst those who think it was probably one big mistake.""Flight 714"" starts off strongly enough, with the first 12 pages devoted to something Herge had perfected inThe Castafiore Emerald- comedies of manners featuring the main characters and others bound to annoy them - but combining it with that genuine sense of unease and discord which underlies all of his best works. Laszlo Carreidas is a truly fascinating character, and he brings out various dimensions of Captain Haddock; Snowy gets some business; and Calculus is at his rip-roaring malapropistic best. But from the moment Carreidas' plane is hijacked, we're into prime James Bond territory. The evil villain and his henchmen have co-opted an entire volcanic island for their ridiculously complex plan (any villain with a past like Rastopopolous can surely find a better means to cash than this...), and characters are tied up, tortured and pursued through various jungle locations.None of the business in the first two-thirds of the album is bad; indeed it all has precedents in the series. But perhaps that's the problem? It's clear that we've come a long way: note the monitor and the proboscis monkey, who each receive two frames in a show of ambience. In early ""Tintin"" books, these guys would've been the subject of a one-or-two page adventure. Herge has learnt now how to balance the atmosphere with the plot. Yet, when we spend an entire third of the book on a chase sequence, one begins to realise that this in no way matches up to the amazing stretch of classic works that immediately preceded it. With the exception of Carreidas himself, the album lacks the emotional resonance ofTintin in Tibet; has none of the elegant plotting ofThe Red Sea Sharks; and - in spite of the jungle atmosphere - lacks the bravura artwork that so embodiesThe Calculus AffairandExplorers on the Moon.Strangely, the only recent ""Tintin"" work that the album calls to mind is ""The Castafiore Emerald"" itself! Herge relished using the claustrophobic, trivial atmosphere of Marlinspike in that album, and it comes across here too. Entire pages focus on the petty trials of Rastopopolous, to the point where he isn't interesting or scary, but just... bumbling. And sequences in which henchmen stutter without teeth, or the villain literally emerges from a bomb blast with his clothes in tatters, are just beneath this era. Comdey is welcomed, and delightful in the early part of the album, but sections where Herge was just painting-by-numbers are brutally evident.This isn't to deny the enjoyment of Carreidas as a character, or the hilarity of the sticking-plaster callback, but much is limited here. I've never noticed the severe drop in quality of art that Michael Farr mentions, but the frames certainly don't sparkle here.And then there's the ending... Where to begin? From page 45, things get weird. Tintin and Haddock have been hearing voices that turn out to be telepathic communications from the queer little man, Mit Kanrokitoff. In and of himself, Kanrokitoff calls to mind other members of Herge's pantheon of humorous bores such as Jolyon Wagg: so far acceptable. And the idea that the ancient Sondonesians had met aliens, and their statues and totems are actually monuments to this? Not terribly original, but still captivating. (The image of a statue to a god turning out to be a man with communications equipment is startling).So far, none of that really contradicts any of the wackier elements of some previous stories. But... the revelation that Kanrokitoff genuinely is an alien, and that he uses his powers - and his flying saucer(!) - to save our characters... is taking things a little too far, don't you think? For a series that has always held some connection to reality, the sudden switch to such fantastic adventures seems unnatural. It doesn't help that the final ten pages expose the formula so much, with literally every major character getting an end-of-page cliffhanger in a seemingly neverending chase. Closing with a four-page news story is also too wordy, and only serves to rehash what happened on the previous eight pages. (The closing revelation that Snowy actually remembers everything is a good one, but can't make up for what has passed.)I'm far from certain about my feelings on ""Flight 714"". As an idea, it's quite intriguing. But with the exception of the opening act, the story never comes together as anything more than one giant chase. The villian is unappealing; the stakes feel too consistently high; and the alien nonsense is from another series altogether. (Again, there are many series where this could be done WONDERFULLY. It's just not in ""Tintin""'s wheelhouse.) A shame, and a true letdown.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/192043.Flight_714_to_Sydney,Flight 714 to Sydney.txt
The Seven Crystal Balls,"This might sound ridiculous to quite a few people reading this review, but I came around to reading this Tintin story as a consequence of my interest in UFO phenomena. Until the 1930s, ball lighting were mysterious ""lights in the sky"" which meteorologists disputed the existence of. General scientific consensus back then viewed ball lightning with the same skepticism that most scientists today aim at hypothetical plasma vortices theorised by UFOlogists such as Jenny Randles as responsible for those crop circles that are particularly difficult to explain as man-made. I then remembered that ball lightning not only plays an important role in this Tintin story, but also makes an appearance on the very cover art.Then I noticed that the two-parter of ""The Seven Crystal Balls"" and ""Prisoners of the Sun"" were among the few Tintin stories I had not read until now, for some reason. Reading them soon after ""The Broken Ear"" was an interesting experience. Both revolve around archaeological artifacts being taken from South America to Western Europe with grave consequences for the Westerners as the indigenous peoples of the America do not take lightly to having their sacred objects placed in museums on the other side of the planet. Yet the later two-parter feels like an immense improvement over ""The Broken Ear"". This is in no small part a consequence of Hergé's decision to space out the story over two volumes. As a result, he doesn't have to move from one action scene or plot twist from the other with reckless abandon but can instead develop each subplot in more depth and give the individual characters more interesting things to do.Speaking of the supporting cast, I just realised that another reason ""Crystal Balls"" is much more interesting than ""The Broken Ear"" is that in the meantime Tintin has acquired all the familiar supporting characters like Captain Haddock, Professor Tournesol, Dupond & Dupont, Madame Castafiore etc. Let's face it, on his own Tintin is a fairly boring character, but as soon as the aforementioned cast of eccentrics become regular fixtures of the series Hergé now gets a lot of humour out of Tintin often being the ""only sane man"" in the cast.Another edge over ""Broken Ear"" is that being a two-parter, Hergé can now in each of the two halves of ""Crystal Balls""/""Prisoners"" focus more on getting a particular genre right. I have as an adult become quite the fan of 1920s/1930s detective novels such as Georges Siménon's Inspector Maigret and Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe novels, and ""Seven Crystal Balls"" for the most part plays like a quite satisfying example of that form. The maybe-magic, maybe-mundane element of supernatural horror that Hergé uses here, in the form of the curse surrounding a mummified Inca king brought to Europe, is also used effectively in the context of an otherwise realistic detective story by Hergé. This is where the ball lightning comes into play, as it figures into the Inca prophecy at the heart of the story and culminates in a scene modelled on a real life incident here in Denmark in 1939 that cast aside all doubt surrounding the existence of ball lightning where a ball lightning enters the private laboratory of a prominent scientist during a thunderstorm and wreaks much havoc. That scene is disturbing to this day especially for a story aimed at children, and must have been even more so when ball lightning had been the stuff of legend until recently.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/146104.The_Seven_Crystal_Balls,The Seven Crystal Balls.txt
Prisoners of the Sun,"Le Temple du Soleilis the sequel toThe Seven Crystal Balls(which I have unfortunately never managed to fully read) and while it is definitely a tale of both engaging high spirited adventure and often even rather majorly hilarious and funny in scope, especially with regard to Captain Haddock's antics and general attitudes (like the repeated times he gets spit in the face by llamas, for considering that llamas tend to only engage in this type of behaviour when and if they are seriously annoyed or feeling threatened in some way, that little salient factoid clearly and humorously demonstrates that the captain does, indeed, often behave inappropriately and like at best a gambolling and annoying curmudgeon, like a rampaging bull in the proverbial china shop) and that in general,Le Temple du Soleilis also quite a bit less majorly ethnically stereotyping than some of Hergé's earlier Tintin graphic novels (such as for example hisTintin au Congowhich is simply terrible and patently unacceptable in EVERY WAY with regard to its in one's face overt racism), there nevertheless is ONE particular episode inLe Temple du Soleilthat made me massively and lastingly annoyed and angry when I first read the latter as a teenager and yes still majorly frustrates me as an adult rereadingLe Temple du Soleil. For while Hergé portrays the Incas as perhaps dangerously misguided in and with their attempts to safeguard their treasures and culture from outsiders (with violence, subterfuge and for Tintin and Captain Haddock with threatened execution for having found their temple) but generally and appreciatively still rather sympathetically depicted and basically for the most part simply concerned with keeping themselves hidden and their imperilled culture and amassed treasures intact and removed from the world, the author, Hergé also both describes and illustrates the Inca as basically simplistically and strangely superstitious.And this becomes especially apparent and clearly shown when Tintin uses that impending solar eclipse about which he had read in a newspaper to obtain freedom for himself and Captain Haddock. Yes, the Incas did historically worship the sun, and thus also and logically would likely still worship the sun inLe Temple du Soleil(and thus, I guess it might make sense to Hergé to have attempted to depict the Incas as superstitious with regard to the sun and of course also afraid of the darkness that a solar eclipse engenders). However, considering that the Incas are deemed and known to be an ancient and advanced civilisation and that solar eclipses do tend to happen regularly, in my opinion, the Incas ofLe Temple du Soleilas very ancient, long-time sun worshippers would have and should have absolutely been aware of solar eclipses as a recurring phenomenon, thus making the method by which Tintin and Captain Haddock escape at best not only rather (if not actually quite) unbelievable but also and far more seriously, frustratingly paternalistic and borderline racially, culturally insulting if not decidedly bigoted in tone (not to mention the inconvenient truth that Tintin using a solar eclipse to basically shock and awe the Incas into letting him and Captain Haddock go does basically make no historical and factual sense whatsoever, considering how advanced the Incas as a civilisation are supposed to have been with regard to mathematics and astronomy, namely that they would almost certainly have been very much able to accurately predict solar eclipses).And indeed I still vividly remember the first time I readLe Temple du Soleilas a teenager (and in German translation, I should add). I had just finished reading a non fiction account on the Incas and their in many ways so advanced civilisation (for high school social studies) and I was happily reading along and actually quite enjoying myself, but to then encounter how Tintin uses the predicted solar eclipse and the supposed superstitions of his sun worshipping Inca captors to escape execution, that did in fact make me do a major and massive double take (a very much and eye-opening and ""oh my gosh"" moment for me). And even now, when rereading, I am still really only willing to grant at most a two and a half star ranking to and for Hergé'sLe Temple du Soleil(not a horrible story by any means, and actually very much enjoyable in many ways, but certainly with still way way too much paternalism and attitudes of Euro-centric superiority present for me to consider raising the rating to three stars). And as such recommended only with the caveat that especially the ""solar eclipse"" episode warrants discussion and debate and should therefore also not just be deemed as simply a necessary plot device ofLe Temple du Soleil, but an inherently problematic authorial attitude that requires at least being pointed out in a critical and very much questioning manner.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/96428.Prisoners_of_the_Sun,Prisoners of the Sun.txt
The Crab with the Golden Claws,"Many years ago, every day at the same time, televisions up and down the country would boom out“Hergé’s Adventures of TIN-TIN”. English children everywhere would drop whatever they were doing, and for the next five minutes would be glued to the family television set. Because five minutes was all there would be each day, of this action-packed continuing animated film.The first story to be adapted wasThe Crab with the Golden Clawsin 1956, although a favourite of mine, much repeated all through the 1960s, was“Objective, Moon!”(which sounds great to a small child if you say it in a big boomy voice). They were adapted from large format slim paperbacks, with stories in comic strip form, four strips per page, and an occasional full page illustration. To be honest, although they are instantly recognisable, I’m not sure I ever read the books. So over time, the memories receded.Then I learned there was to be a major film called“The Adventures of Tintin”. It was to be directed by Steven Spielberg, produced by Peter Jackson, and partly written by Stephen Moffat. The plan was for a motion capture computer-animated film, with a starry cast of actors to provide the voice-overs. With names like these, it was a must-watch film, and I vaguely wondered what had caught the attention of these cinema giants, to want to revive the series. I learned that Steven Spielberg had become an avid fan of the Tintin comic books in 1981, after a critic reviewing his film“Raiders of the Lost Ark”had compared it with Tintin’s adventures. There had been live action film versions of Hergé’s comics before, but Hergé himself didn’t like them, and thought that Spielberg was the only person who could ever do Tintin justice. Hergé met with Spielberg in 1983 and although he died that week, his widow subsequently gave Spielberg the rights in 1984.The film was put on hold, and finally made for release in 2011. It proved to be an exciting and fast-paced adventure. The plot was a loose adaptation of three “Tintin” booksThe Crab with the Golden Claws(1941),“The Secret of the Unicorn”(1943) and“Red Rackham’s Treasure”(1944). It was called“The Adventures of Tintin”in the USA, and named after the middle book of the series,“Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn”elsewhere:Watching this proved entertaining enough for me to search out the original books, which are still in print, and I started at the beginning withThe Crab with the Golden Claws.What a treat it proved to be! I chortled my way through it, enjoying the language as much as the cartoons, and realising that, clever as the special effects in the films could be, a lot of the humour could not transfer. Many of the expressions on the faces of the characters, the liveliness of the drawing style, the sneaky asides in the detail (which the reader only notices after a moment) – all these are necessarily lost when a successful cartoon is changed to a different format. Here is the first page:Yet this is only a taster for the story itself. To start with, Tintin meets up with his friends Thomson and Thomson. They are alike as two peas in a pod; a couple of bumbling Belgian civil servants, complete with brollies and bowler hats. They tell him of a case involving a drowned man, some counterfeit coins, and a scrap of paper from what appears to be a tin of crab meat with the word“Karaboudjan”scrawled on it.Tintin instantly remembers the piece of paper Snowy had dragged out of the dustbins, and runs back to see if he can retrieve it. The action-filled pages describe Tintin’s investigation on a ship called the“Karaboudjan”where he is taken prisoner by a gang of criminals who have hidden opium in the cargo of crab tins. With the help of his trusty friend Snowy the dog, who chews through the ropes tying him up, Tintin escapes from the cabin he has been locked in, by knocking out the man bringing him food, leaving the man himself bound and gagged there instead.Then we see the first introduction of everyone’s favourite seafarer,“Captain Haddock”, who is a recurring character in the series. Instantly we deduce that this sea captain is, at the moment, very worse for drink. Very maudlin and comically yearning for his dear old mother, he is completely useless to our young hero Tintin. Captain Haddock has been manipulated by his first mate, Allan, and is unaware of his crew’s criminal activities. Tintin hides in the locker under the bed and gets the better of both Allan and Jumbo, the sailor left in the cabin, by tricking them into thinking he has climbed out of the porthole back into the storeroom. It is Jumbo who is left tied to a chair and gagged. And while Allan blows open the storeroom door with explosives, only to find it empty, and Jumbo tied up in the Captain’s room, our plucky young hero and Captain Haddock have managed to escape in a handy lifeboat.The scenes in the lifeboat are hilarious, as more than once the daring duo’s lives are in peril due to the drunken exploits of Captain Haddock. However, they manage to send a radio message to the police about the cargo, whereupon they are attacked by rapid gunfire from a seaplane. Never fear, Tintin and the Captain hijack the plane, tie up the pilots, and try to reach dry land. Captain Haddock’s drunken antics in a storm mean that they crash-land in the Sahara, and the plane bursts into flames, whereupon the imprisoned crew escape.They have no food and no water, but Snowy is dauntless and leads them to a place full of bones. Surely this is all they will need?They trek across the desert, and the combination of Captain Haddock’s inebriation, desert mirages and dehydration nearly combine to be the end of both of them.But eventually Tintin and Captain Haddock are rescued and taken to the French Outpost of Afghar, where they meet the hearty“Lieutenant Delcourt”. (He plies them with drink, but Tintin insists that they will not join in, much to Captain Haddock’s disgruntlement – and our delighted amusement). The three hear on the radio that the“Karaboudjan”has sunk in a violent storm, and Lieutenant Delcourt provides Arab guides and camels to help them on their journey to a Moroccan port.On the way they are attacked by armed raiders near“Kefheir”, but Captain Haddock is magnificently brave, fighting them off as much with his extraordinarily eccentric and elaborate use of language, and aggressive postures, as anything:“Swine! Jellyfish! Tramps! Troglodytes! Toffee-noses!… Savages! Aztecs! Toads! Carpet-Sellers! Iconoclasts! … Rats! Ectoplasms! Cowards! Baboons! Parasites! Pockmarks!”and so on. Captain Haddock has shown himself as a force to be reckoned with – and to have a very short fuse.However, once at the port of“Bagghar”, they keep getting separated as they try to find the harbour master. Then the worthy and valiant Captain Haddock is kidnapped, after he and Tintin recognise the disguised ship, the“Karaboudjan”. Various other diversions are provided by a mad dog (Snowy acting the part) and a stooge of a businessmen, Tintin disguised as a blind beggar, and the Thomson twins reappearing heavily disguised in Arab robes. They tell Tintin of a wealthy merchant,“Omar ben Salaad”, who is selling the crab tins. Together they decide to discreetly investigate, and despite much confusion and bumbling, manage to trap some of the gang in a cellar and call the police. Both Tintin and Captain Haddock (and Snowy) unfortunately become intoxicated by the fumes from wine barrels which had been shot with holes by the villains, but eventually Captain Haddock chases a member of the gang from the cellar to an entrance behind a bookcase in Omar ben Salaad’s house:“Harlequin! Hydrocarbon! Polynesian! Gyroscope! Anthropithecus! Blackbird! Invertebrate! Liquorice” “Tiddley–om–pom–pom”(this last merrily sung by Tintin).Gradually sobering up, Tintin discovers a necklace of a crab with golden claws on the owner of the wine cellar, who is of course Omar ben Salaad, now lying senseless, heavily stunned by the falling bookcase. They realise that he is the leader of the drug cartel. Allan, Captain Haddock’s mate and leader of the gang steals a boat and tries to escape, but the two set off in hot pursuit, aided by the Thomson twins (still in their robes) and the Moroccan police. After more hilarious capers, Tintin captures him, and he is arrested.A Japanese man introduces himself to Tintin. He is“Bunjo Kuraki”, a police detective who had been trying to warn Tintin of the drugs gang. He had been kidnapped but managed to sent Tintin a note, of which only the scrap with the word“Karaboudjan”was found. Bunjo Kuraki had been investigating a sailor,“Herbert Dawes”, who had been a member of Captain Haddock’s crew. He had boasted to the detective that he could get him some opium, but had since drowned.Turning on the radio a few days later, Tintin learns that, thanks to him, the entire drug cartel“the Crab with the Golden Claws”is behind bars. Captain Haddock has been invited to give a talk about the dangers of drink, but there is a curious lull in the radio programme. The story ends on an amusing note. Apparently the gap in the broadcast was due to the shock Captain Haddock experienced on drinking a glass of a most unfamiliar beverage – water!“The Adventures of Tintin”was originally a series of comics by the Belgian cartoonist Hergé. They featured a young Belgian reporter“Tintin”and his dog“Snowy”. Surprisingly, the stories do not seem overly dated. Yet originallyThe Crab With the Golden Claws, the ninth one, was serialised in weekly parts between October 1940 and 1941. It was published in“Le Soir Jeunesse”, a children’s supplement to“Le Soir”, Belgium’s leading francophone newspaper, and was therefore published in the middle of the German Occupation of Belgium during World War II.AlthoughThe Crab With the Golden Clawswas published in book form shortly afterwards, it was not published in the USA until the 1960s, as the first Tintin story. It had been heavily edited to remove all black faces. The black Africans depicted in Hergé’s original were changed to be a white sailor and an Arab. Apparently the American publisher had reservations about depicting blacks and whites mixing together. This has resulted in a rather odd cartoon where Captain Haddock protests“Arrest that Negro! He’s a gangster …”and the reader can clearly see that the character running away is a heavy-set individual with swarthy skin, a stubbly chin, a drooping moustache and a skull cap!Although these are cartoons, in my opinion the drawings are mainly gently poking fun at personality types, rather than depicting offensive ethnic stereotypes, which could have been the case from drawings of this period. The accent is heavily on the humour. For instance, we are invited to identify with the affronted imam in front of a mosque, having kicked out the Thomson twins (now sitting crestfallen on the road) for not having removed their shoes. Whether it is a portly French gentleman, a faceless member of the French police, a handsome and affably dim, square-jawed Army officer, or a small and slender Japanese man, finely featured with narrow eyes and dimples, all are depicted with great humour and charm. We laugh amiably at them all – and at ourselves for doing so. The thugs are typically thugs, and of various racial types.Although this book can be enjoyed by young children, who will follow the story through the pictures, it is quite a complicated plot to follow in detail, and has a wealth of incidentally funny moments which only an adult will see. Many of the place names are puns. For instance, the town of“Kefheir”is a pun on the French expression“Que faire?”, meaning“What is to be done?”, and the port of“Bagghar”(baggare) translates as“scrape or fight”. Best of all, the name“Omar ben Salaad”means“Lobster Salad”in French.This book will likely give you a few guffaws, and fortunately there are over twenty in the series to look forward to, the next book of course being the one the film was called after“The Secret of the Unicorn”. It is a fast-moving, exciting story, full to the brim with slapstick humour.But it has to be said that my favourite character of all is the brave, super-intelligent, canine consort and faithful friend, Snowy. He’s my true hero.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/165555.The_Crab_with_the_Golden_Claws,The Crab with the Golden Claws.txt
The Shooting Star,"Before I read the final book in Charles Burns’ X’Ed Out Trilogy, I wanted to re-read Herge’s Tintin book, The Shooting Star, besides Burns’ first two books, to see if it would add anything to the overall experience. Having just finished The Shooting Star and from what I remember of Burns’ comics, there’s unfortunately no major connection besides the visual. It also turns out this Tintin book is pretty awful too - (not so) shockingly, my pre-teen self was wrong about this one (even though I didn’t remember a thing about it besides the cover)!A piece of a giant meteorite, the size of a small island, crash-lands in the Arctic Ocean with no environmental impact besides making the water around its immediate vicinity boiling hot. Nobody on Earth besides two organisations - a good one and a bad one - are interested in this event and, with Tintin, Snowy and Captain Haddock leading the good guys’ ship, they race each other to the crash site to claim any potential cosmic treasures laying around.For 50 pages of this 62-page book, it’s a very unremarkable adventure tale. As is his wont, Tintin stumbles across some scientists who instantly include him in their work and expedition, along with his talking dog and alcoholic sea captain (who should really be in jail, rather than appointed head of an expedition!).The bad guys attempt some laughable Whacky Races-type schtick to throw Tintin and co. off, like lighting a giant stick of dynamite and leaving it in the open for anyone to spot. There’s the usual slapstick from Snowy and Haddock (yup, whiskey and loquacious insults again), and everything once more falls to our bizarrely-looking plucky journalist hero to save the day.The only really interesting part of the book happens in the last dozen pages on the meteorite/island where Tintin and Snowy encounter what looks to be an egg which grows rapidly into an exploding mushroom. Some more surreal scenes follow before the book ends unsatisfactorily and much too conveniently with none of the questions surrounding the events on the meteorite answered.Looking at this alongside Burns’ X’Ed Out books (at least the first two), I suppose the surreality is something he would riff on in his books, along with some of the visuals, but there’s not much here to connect the two. Maybe Burns’ comics will look into where the meteorite/alien eggs came from?The Shooting Star is a generic Tintin adventure tale offering little originality besides some interesting space oddity at the end. But it’s a kid’s book that younger readers will probably find enjoyable enough so I can’t come down too harshly on the many poorly written, overly simplistic scenes that bored me as an adult.Anyway, I’m sure there are some great Tintin books out there that’ll captivate readers of all-ages but, not having read any recently, I can only say that The Shooting Star definitely isn’t one of them.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/146107.The_Shooting_Star,The Shooting Star.txt
Land of Black Gold,"Tintin was one of the comic book heroes of my childhood. I'm going to read my way through the series again as I listen to a radio program about him, and his creator, Hergé. Book fifteen in the Tintin series actually has a very long story behind it. Hergé began to write, and publish it years before, but the outbreak of the second world war put a stop to that. Then after the war had ended Hergé began working on it again.It begins with Thomson, and Thompson driving when their car goes boom. Their car isn't the only one to do this, as there seems to be an outbreak of cars going boom for no apparent reason. War is on the horizon, and Captain Haddock is enlisted to the navy, but Tintin starts to investigate this strange car disease, an investigation that leads him to the Middle East.Reading this book now is interesting in many ways because of certain similarities between what is happening in the book and on the news. Just think about the European energy crisis for example. But that is about it. It's interesting, but not a great book. Perhaps it suffers from coming after two good two book adventures, and perhaps it's just the long time it took to make it. Either way, it never really takes off for me.The humour is there, Thomson and Thompson are the butt of most of the jokes, some of which are very well done, like the illness they contract at the end. There is also the long joke around Captain Haddocks mission in the later part of the book, which is unusual in the series, and has quite a funny punchline. But on the whole it's just too little. The adventure is a bit aimless, and the writing doesn't feels as tight as in some other books.So not among the best, and not among the worst, just a passable Tintin adventure.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/146128.Land_of_Black_Gold,Land of Black Gold.txt
The Castafiore Emerald,"REVIEW OF THE ALSATIAN TRANSLATIONWhile I have read this here instalment of the Tintin series multiple times in both German and French (in the French original, its title isLes Bijoux de la Castafioreand in German it is calledDie Juwelen der Sängerin), I am indeed very much thrilled to finally have been able to find a (rare) copy of this book in Alsatian, which is why the book title might seem a bit different and strange to Tintin fans (De Castafiore ihre Schmuck). Furthermore, please do note that in German (and in the low Allemannic dialect of Alsatian, of Elsässisch), Schmuck simply means jewelry; it does NOT have the negative connotations it has in Yiddish. And oh wow, readingLes Bijoux de la Castafiorein Alsatian is proving to be so much linguistic fun for me. I had always been under the impression that Alsatian, while indeed a German dialect (or rather a Low Allemannic dialect), should be considered a French/German Creole type of language, but upon readingDe Castafiore ihre Schmuck, I for one do no longer really consider it as a true Creole, but basically a staunchly German based dialect that uses a certain amount of French vocabulary for salutations, terms of respect and such (in other words, the grammar, the sentence structure of Alsatian is German, is Allemannic, as is in fact most of the vocabulary used, with some specific French word choices providing what I would label a decorative trim).I was also a bit pleasantly flabbergasted at how much of the Alsatian is really, truly easy for me to figure out and understand, until I decided to do some online research and began to understand and realise that Alsatian as a Low Allemannic dialect is both geographically and linguistically close and linked to the dialects spoken in and around Basle, Switzerland and to what in German we call and label as Lake of Constance Allemannic ""Bodenseeallemannisch"" (which is the dialect my mother's family speaks, and thus it makes perfect sense that I am somewhat familiar with it, having heard it, even if I have not actively used it, on multiple visits to the area both recently and not so recently). And of course, I am also now more keen than ever to locate any other Tintin books that have been translated into Alsatian (I think there might be three more, but I am not sure).And as to the specific narrative themes and contents ofDe Castafiore ihre Schmuck, there is considerably more straight out humour and slapstick comedy visible and present than the standard, than the usual cloak and dagger adventures of the majority of Hergé's Tintin series contain, especially with regard to the eponymous clowns and jesters of the series, curmudgeonly Captain Haddock and the accident prone Duponts (all three of them experience à la The Three Stooges a myriad of both physical and psychological, mental calamities, including for the unfortunate Captain Haddock the neither tender nor in any way desired attentions and mercies of opera singer Bianca Castafiore, who basically does descend on his humble manner, his refuge and home like a grating and chaotic but also entertaining tsunami).Now the above all being said though, and while much of the action presented and featured throughout the illustrated text ofDe Castafiore ihre Schmuckis most definitely entirely physical and at times even rather violent slap stick like humour, the author (Hergé) has also (and appreciatively) included subtle satire and pointed socio-critical jabs at cultural stereotyping (with regard to the Roma, who have not only been harassed and forced by the authorities to set up camp near the town dump, but who are later after they have been granted refuge at Marlinspike Manor, unjustly accused of having stolen Bianca Castafiore's jewels simply because they are Gypsies), as well as criticisms of the tabloid media and paparazzi (who basically descend on Captain Hadock's manor like a pack of raging lunatic locusts when it becomes common knowledge that famous opera diva Castafiore is indeed visiting).But I do have to wonder a bit if younger children readingDe Castafiore ihre Schmuck(in whatever edition, whether in French, English, German, Alsatian etc.) would necessarily catch all of the included, featured cultural and societal allusions and innuendoes. Case in point, the first time I read this story (at around the age of eight, and in German translation), I certainly did NOT make the connection that Tintin manages as to what had really happened to the ""stolen"" jewels (that due to Rossini's opera La Gazza Ladra, The Thieving Magpie, being mentioned in a newspaper article, Tintin realises and then proves that a magpie and not the wrongfully accused Roma had stolen Castafiore's baubles, that the thief was indeed a thieving magpie of tradition and folklore). And with these nuances in mind, and although I do very highly recommendDe Castafiore ihre Schmuckas one of the most humorous and entertaining offerings of Hergé's Tintin series, some of the themes, some of the details and especially many of he satirical asides and such might well be beyond younger children.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/146106.The_Castafiore_Emerald,The Castafiore Emerald.txt
Explorers on the Moon,"On a Marché sur la Lune = Explorers on the Moon (Tintin #17), HergéExplorers on the Moon is the seventeenth volume of The Adventures of Tintin, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé. The story was serialised weekly in Belgium's Tintin magazine from October 1952 to December 1953 before being published in a collected volume by Casterman in 1954.Completing a story arc begun in the preceding volume, Destination Moon (1953), the narrative tells of the young reporter Tintin, his dog Snowy, and friends Captain Haddock, Professor Calculus, and Thomson and Thompson who are aboard humanity's first manned rocket mission to the Moon.Professor Calculus, Tintin, Snowy, Captain Haddock, and Calculus's assistant Frank Wolff are aboard an atomic rocket-powered spacecraft leaving the Earth bound for the Moon. Soon after takeoff they discover that the detectives Thomson and Thompson have accidentally stowed away on board, putting a strain on the oxygen supply.The detectives accidentally turn off the nuclear motor, disrupting the artificial gravity and sending everyone floating until Tintin corrects the problem.They then suffer a relapse of the Formula 14 drug (seen in Land of Black Gold), resulting in their hair growing rapidly in multiple colours, until Calculus subsequently administers a cure.Haddock, who has smuggled whisky aboard the rocket, gets drunk and takes an impromptu spacewalk, during which he briefly becomes a satellite of the asteroid Adonis, but Tintin is able to rescue him.The rocket lands in the Hipparchus Crater, with Tintin being the first human to step on the Moon. ...تاریخ نخستین خوانش: سال 1973میلادیعنوان: روی ماه قدم گذاشتیم؛ نویسنده: هرژه؛ مترجم: خسرو سمیعی؛ تهران، یونیورسال، 1352، در 62ص، موضوع: داستانهای فکاهی از نویسندگان بلژیکی - سده ی 20مکتاب «روی ماه قدم گذاشتیم»، یا «کاشفان روی ماه»، هفدهمین کتاب، از سری کتابهای مصور «ماجراهای تن‌ تن و میلو» است؛ این کتاب، دنباله‌ ای بر داستان «هدف کره ماه» میباشد؛ کتاب «روی ماه قدم گذاشتیم»، نخستین بار در سال 1954میلادی، توسط «هرژه»، نگاشته شد، طراحی شد، و به چاپ رسید؛پروفسور «تورنِسُل»، موشکی را، آماده کرده، تا «تن‌ تن»، «میلو»، «کاپیتان هادوک»، و دستیار خود «فرانک وولف» را، با آن، به سوی ماه بفرستد؛ اما دو کارآگاه، «دوپونت»، و «دوپونط»، که سرگرم وارسی امنیتی موشک بوده‌ اند، ساعت پرتاب موشک را، اشتباه گرفته، و فکر می‌کردند، که زمان پرتاب، یک و سی و چهار دقیقه بعد از ظهر روز بعد، انجام می‌شود، در حالیکه، پرتاب یک و سی و چهار دقیقه بامداد، انجام شد، و این دو کارآگاه، به طور ناخواسته، با مسافران موشک، همراه شدند؛ این باعث می‌شد، که سرنشینان، با خطر کمبود اکسیژن روبرو شوند، زیرا در این سفر فضایی، تنها برای چهار انسان و یک سگ، اکسیژن در نظر گرفته شده‌ است، ...؛موشک، سرانجام، در دهانه ی «هیپارکوس» در ماه، فرود می‌آید، و با توافق گروه، «تن‌تن»، به عنوان «نخستین انسان»، گام بر روی ماه می‌گذارد؛ پس از او، همگی با لباس‌های فضایی خود، به گام زدن، در اطراف موشک، سرگرم می‌شوند؛ پس از آن، خدمه، با یک تانک ماه‌نورد، به شناسایی منطقه، می‌پردازند، و «تن‌تن»، در دالان‌های زیر یک غار، که در راه دهانه ی «بطلمیوس» واقع شده، یخ و رگه ‌هایی از «اورانیوم»، و «رادیوم» کشف می‌کند...؛در ادامه ی داستان، مشخص می‌شود، که «وولف»، دستیار «پروفسور تورنسل»، با یک جاسوس، به نام «سرهنگ یورگن»، همکاری کرده، و او را مخفیانه، به داخل موشک آورده، تا در راه بازگشت، موشک را دزدیده، و به یک دولت بیگانه، بدهند؛ «یورگن»، آنگاه که دیگر سرنشینان، در حال گردش در ماه‌ هستند، از پنهانگاه خود بیرون آمده، و «تن‌تن» را، بیهوش می‌کند، و به «وولف»، دستور می‌دهد، تا با برجا گذاشتن دیگر مسافران در ماه، موتور را روشن، و موشک را، به زمین برگرداند؛ در این میان، «تن‌تن» به هوش آمده، و دوباره کنترل اوضاع را، از دست «یورگن» درمی‌آورد، و دنباله ی داستانتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 17/11/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/165556.Explorers_on_the_Moon,Explorers on the Moon.txt
Cigars of the Pharaoh,"The first of Tintin's full length adventures4 February 2012This is the story where Tintin comes on his own. While it was still written in a serialised form when it first appeared back in 1934, this story has a proper story arc where Tintin stumbles on a sophisticated drug smuggling ring that stretches across the entire Eurasian continent. It is here that Tintin's companions begin to be developed (namely the Thompson twins) and we also begin to see Tintin going on real adventures and chasing after a singular bad guy. Where Tintin in America seemed to be a hodge podge of different stories thrown together, here we begin to see a well constructed adventure.Tintin is on a Mediterranean cruise (much to Snowy's annoyance - and here we begin to see the character of Snowy, the loyal and faithful companion, developed as well) when he runs into the first of Herge's many absent minded professors, Dr Sophocles Sarcophagus. He is travelling to Egypt to uncover a lost tomb. Tintin also meets one of the recurring villains of the piece, the film mogul Rastapopolous. Herge developed this character very well in this book because we do not, at this stage, realise that he is the bad guy, and in fact when the master of the drug ring falls off a cliff at the end, we are left wondering who it was and whether we will ever find out.While this story can be read on its own, it does carry over to the Blue Lotus, however I never got to read the Blue Lotus until a long time afterwards. As for this story, it is by far my favourite of the Tintin adventures. Some have suggested that Herge had not got the culture element right here, but we will note that after the Blue Lotus, Herge begins to create his own countries where the adventures are placed, and maybe it is a move away from raising clearly raising his concerns to being much more subtle in his criticism.Yet we do have criticism within this story (as we do with the next one as well). It is not until Tintin reaches India that we are confronted with the destruction that a lot of these drug smuggler's are causing. While as a kid we read this book and considered that drugs smuggling was bad because Tintin is out to get them, it is when he meets the Raj of Gaipajama that the major concern is raised. The Raj is out to stop the smugglers because of the suffering they cause his people (and Herge is obviously trying to raise awareness of the practice, which still occurs today), namely that the smugglers force the peasants to grow opium poppies and purchase the poppies off of them at a significant discount. However, because the peasants are growing poppies they are unable to grow their own food, and as such are forced to purchase food off of the smuggler's at a significant premium.The comedy is ramped up a lot here as well. Tintin in America was simply silly in a lot of cases, but now we have the Thompson twins, two Interpol Agents (I believe, though the English versions suggest that they are Scotland Yard) who bumble their way through the investigation, and but end up being the assistance that Tintin needs to crack the case. The most amusing part was where they think they see Tintin sitting behind a dune and whack him on the head with a cane only to discover it is a sheik. In the next panel, Tintin arrives at a city that is being mobilised for war because one of their sheiks was attacked. Then there are the three huge Indians let into Tintin's cell, to teach him a lesson, and then we hear the sounds of fighting, and an ambulance rushing off to pick up the wounded, only to discover that it was the three Indian dudes – golden.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/146122.Cigars_of_the_Pharaoh,Cigars of the Pharaoh.txt

Punderworld Volume 1,"If you've seen those cute comics of Hades and Persephone that sometimes do the rounds online – this is the first collection of those. Yes, the title is terrible, and not even that applicable, because while there is humour here, it's derived far more from character, reaction faces and the odd pratfall than puns. What I hadn't expected, though, was the serious bits. Given the ongoing vogue for retelling classical legends to point up the raw deal women tend to get in the originals, it's fascinating that Linda Sejic has gone the other way, taking one of the stories where the default reading was that the woman was getting a raw deal, and retelling it as a sweet romance. Thus, Persephone here becomes the overworked, shut-away daughter of a controlling mother, never allowed out to other gods' festivals; Hades, meanwhile, is a shy guy admiring her from afar for centuries, never daring to make a move until well-meaning but brash Zeus appoints himself wingman and lends a hand. And yes, all his initial suggestions do run along familiar lines (""So first, you turn into a bee"").It's an angle I could easily see pissing off both the doctrinaire, and those who were already personally invested in the usual Wuthering Heights-esque interpretation, but its popularity isn't ever so surprising when it has Sejic's reliably winning art to convince the doubters. From the most relatable human microexpressions to the grand mythic panoplies and shows of force, she makes it all look both beautiful and real – which also enables her to blur the boundaries between those categories yet keep any hint of bathos entirely deliberate, as when the Styx gives a watery thumbs-up and it's funny, yes, but still impressive with it. Really, my only complaint is that like too many Image books it's littered with homophones, duplicate words and typos, and could really have done with an editor to buff these entirely unnecessary imperfections out of a generally lovely read.(Edelweiss ARC)",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58155191-punderworld-volume-1,Punderworld Volume 1.txt
The Ballad of Halo Jones,"This is simply amazing! Literally! It takes an absolutely ordinary character with no real talents or powers and writes her story in such a way that it becomes larger than life. It’s what comic books/graphic novels are really all about, at least from this reader’s point of view. For, at heart, I feel that one of the main reasons why anyone cracks one of these open is to transfer their ordinary life onto the pages of these fantastical illustrations that somehow briefly becomes their own, if but for a moment. Here, the margin from the reality of the average life is narrowed that much more in the character of a regular gal named Halo Jones and in the process becomes more even more accessible in this particular regard. Albeit, far removed in the future with aliens, space travel and technology that is well beyond our own.Overall, Alan Moore is a huge talent whose accomplishments are well known to most of us already. Even those are somehow unfamiliar with his name at this point have at least unknowingly watched a few of the many film adaptations of his work. He’s scary good and much deserving of his reputation. Particularly so in the case of this series, which was abandoned midway and never completed and yet still manages to draw one into it so skillfully that you forgive its few minor faults of silliness as well as the with foreknowledge that you there is no real resolution or ending to it.Although this leading us down a path to nowhere is an unforgivable crime, how this came about is completely understandable, as well as just another reason why Moore is so beloved. It’s his integrity and status as an underground champion that is at the heart of the matter here. You see, the company that originally issued these books had sole rights to all stories and characters that Moore created and in protest he stopped work on this project until a new contract more in his favor could be negotiated. All of us are still waiting some thirty years later.So, who can really blame him for wanting control and ownership over his own work? For perspective, just think of the early rock ‘n’ roll and blues artists and how they all lost millions over their brilliant creations in a similar way. Rather than call Moore greedy and unreasonable let’s just agree to find fault with the real culprit and shit all over the publishing company instead, shall we?Subsequently, only three out of a projected five books of this series were ever published before all the trouble with legalities put an end to it all. The saga of the unemployed and unskilled Halo was meant to follow her life from youth to old age. This is something that is by itself is an interesting premise for this genre alone. Sadly, all we have of her story is her life up her mid thirties…but what a ride it is! Also, Ian Gibson’s wonderful black and white illustrations are considered among his best work here as well.The first book of this series merely seems concerned with setting the stage and didn’t necessarily grip me by its story, which I found somewhat meandering and bordering on pointless for all the action that DOES NOT take place here. There’s also the fact that there is an entirely different slang used here that you have to grow accustomed to, as well as the same for the overall foreign environment and setting of this story with all of their futuristic alien names. Rather than explaining it all through some all-knowing narrator, or similar device, Moore just shows us through actions. The back-story flashbacks eventually happen but only in the later books.If you’re like me, acclimating to these things could try ones patience to the point of losing it. Initially, I even thought that this was going to be the one thing I was going to hate of Moore’s but I kept reading it regardless and I’m glad I did. Overall, this author is not necessarily interested in pleasing or accommodating the fickle tastes of the average comic book reader. He seems to write merely to suit himself and if we are willing to follow him I think that this nearly always pays off.Things become much more livelier by the second book and there are some intriguing premises and classic story devices used here that kept my interest. Of course, almost anything would have been an improvement over the first one. Here, near Shakespearean or classic Greek drama of love, betrayal, and something called a rat king are introduced. Also, by this time the jarring and unfamiliar slang starts becoming more understandable and for me even warmly embraced.In book three all the stops are pulled out and this story starts to really take off. Halo enters a complete downward spiral of depression and alcoholism over her lack of direction in life that eventually leads her to the desperation of enlisting in the galactic army. This takes her to some interesting but yet familiar alien territory that one can readily recognize as either extra-terrestrial versions of Vietnam or Korea, take your pick. After some harrowing experiences as a foot soldier Halo has a complete mental breakdown and once she eventually recovers she begrudgingly re-enlists again with no other options available to her. For at this point in her life, this is the only occupation she is fit or qualified for, let alone among the few even available to her.From here on out, the science used here in regards to the concept of time is absolutely spectacular and mind-blowing and the handling of this is just one of the many reasons why Moore is so revered. Moreover, his main characters start to become fleshed out more fully and even the minor ones start to become more interesting as well. Moore’s understanding of a pace of a story is simply masterful here.Of course then it all ends. If I could be so bold as to suppose where some of this may have been heading, I would guess that whatever was in store for us in the next books would have been built around a confusion of reality and fantasy stemming from Halo’s previous mental breakdown. The seeds of this seem to be planted in this last book but beyond this there really is no telling where this story could have gone in the hands of such an incredible artist and sadly we may never know. Overall, I think this is still so good that you’ll find yourself wanting to know exactly how this story DOESN’T end for yourself and I highly recommend that you do with absolutely no reservations.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59710.The_Ballad_of_Halo_Jones,The Ballad of Halo Jones.txt
GloomCookie,"As a huge fan of Disney villains, I first discovered Serena Valentino several years ago when I discovered her novelFairest of All: A Tale of the Wicked Queen, a prequel to the Disney movieSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs, andFairestquickly became one of my favorite novels of all time upon reading it. She has since published several more books that take place in the same universe, effectively creating her own universe in which most (if not all) classic Disney movies seem to coexist. Not too long after becoming a fan of Serena and her writing, I also discovered that she had two series of graphic novels, one titledGloom Cookieand the other titledNightmares & Fairy Tales, but it has taken me a long time to get to start reading them because, as Serena has stated herself, they are now out of print and difficult to find, and I have begun reading theGloom Cookieseries due to having put holds on the books through the interlibrary loan system via the college where I teach. My hope is that I will be able to continue to do this for the entirety of both series because I absolutely love the first volume ofGloom Cookie, and much is left unresolved at the end of this first volume (which collects the first six issues of the series). Serena Valentino is the writer, and Ted Naifeh is the artist, and both the writing and the somewhat Burtonesque art come together to create a wonderful blend of gothic beauty and comedy, and while I know that there is probably almost no chance of this ever happening, I think thatGloom Cookiewould make a great television series. While it may be true that some of the characters, such as the bad gothic poet Vermilion, are simplified and seem to function more as caricatures than fully developed characters, that works well toward the purpose ofGloom Cookie's world, which seems to playfully and affectionately poke fun at and parody gothic culture and gothic art: ""At first he seemed really cool and stuff,"" Lex (the story's lead heroine) explains to her friends as she recounts a date gone wrong with the aforementioned Vermilion. ""He even planned a picnic at the graveyard"" (Valentino 55). Perhaps the most intriguing character is the story's primary villain, Queen Isabella; even though she is spiteful and vengeful, the story frequently hints at the possibility that there is literally more to her than meets the eye, and her slim figure, black attire, and horned head (she can actually be seen on the graphic novel's cover art) all come together in order to remind me a great deal of Maleficent. I, in fact, recently sent Selena a message and told her that, and she said, ""She was an inspiration. I've always loved Maleficent."" (There is even a scene inGloom Cookiethat is definitely intended to be reminiscent of the iconic christening scene from the opening ofSleeping Beauty. Much of the narrative, in fact, seems reminiscent of classic fairy tales.) I also love the anachronisms seen throughout the story; many of the story's elements (such as Pukémon, Icky Martin, The Spice Sluts, and The Backyard Boys seen as posters on characters' bedroom walls) seem to place it in the late 1990s or early 2000s (which is actually when Serena originally penned the story), but other elements (such as Victorian attire and hansoms) seem to place it centuries sooner than that. I absolutely loveGloom Cookie, and there is only one reason why I award it four stars rather than the full five stars: there are several rather annoying errors throughout, such astheirortherebeing placed where it should bethey're,yourbeing placed where it should beyou're, etc., and with part of the story being set in New Orleans, the infamous serial killer Madame Delphine LaLaurie is mentioned, but her name is (perhaps intentionally?) misspelled as MadameLe Lori. As someone who majored in English in college and now teaches it, I cannot help but notice such errors and be (slightly) annoyed by them, but they do little to nothing to take much away from the story. As aforementioned, I adoreGloom Cookieand am really looking forward to reading the second volume.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1641887.GloomCookie,GloomCookie.txt
Tank Girl,"Після анонсу коміксу «Танкістка» Алана Мартіна та Джеймі Г’юлета пройшло вже досить багато часу, що багато поціновувачів мальописів уже не мали надії побачити класику британської коміксової культури українською мовою. Тому, коли проект почав показувати признаки життя, це стало надзвичайно хорошою новиною. А тепер уже навіть тримаю це велико-форматне видання від видавництва Other Comix (імпринт UA Comix якщо що) в руках.Але, що це за видання і чим воно відрізняється від оригінальних коміксів? Ці короткі історії, які мали п’ять і більше сторінок, почали виходити в далекому 1988 році, ще в британському журналі «Deadline», і були чорно-білими. Далі, після того, як ці комікси набули популярності, то були перевидані окремими томами, кожен із яких містив у собі кілька цих коротких історій про екстравагантну Танкістку. І вже через багато років потому, видавництво Titan Comics вирішило ще раз перевидати ці старі комікси, але вже в кольорі, фарбуванням яких займалася колористка Трейсі Бейлі. Так би мовити, «осучаснити» малюнок для нових читачів. І саме таке кольорове видання вийшло друком і в нас українською мовою. Це не є якась нова практика й таку долю спіткало, для прикладу, серії коміксів «Усаґі Йоджімбо» Стена Сакая чи «Ходячі мерці» Роберта Кіркмана.Описати сюжет цих коміксів чи цього тому складно, оскільки в ньому відсутня послідовна сюжетна лінія. Однак головною героїнею завжди є Танкістка, або Ребекка Бак, яка мешкає в постапокаліптичній Австралії, що стала пустелею після природної чи ядерної катастрофи. Світ наповнений кенгуру-мутантами, а вода перебуває в приватній власності. Незважаючи на суворі умови життя, Танкістка не втрачає почуття гумору й не підкоряється владі. У перших кількох випусках першого тому на неї чекають різні пригоди: романтична зустріч із кенгуру, переляк президента через відсутність калоприймача, переслідування небезпечних мисливців за головами, викрадання улюбленого пива, знайомство з дівчиною-реактивницею чи дівчиною-підводницею і заохочення свого кенгуру-бойфренда до боксу. Незважаючи на складнощі, Танкістка виконує різні ролі в цих коміксах: військової, найманки, кур’єрки чи агентки-провокаторки. Вона погоджується на будь-яку роботу, яка добре оплачується, щоб збільшити свій добробут.Основна сутність Танкістки характеризується зухвалістю, неввічливістю та грайливим почуттям гумору. Вона гучна, палить цигарки й дуже імпульсивна. Вона насолоджується випадковими актами насильства й сексу. Вона нічого не продумує, а це означає, що ви ніколи не знаєте, що станеться далі. Єдине, що тут можна назвати стабільним — це те, що вона нікого не слухає. У 1990-х роках це був новаторський комікс із нецензурною, грубою, незалежною та бажаною дівчиною, яка любила друзів і коханого кенгуру. Незважаючи на свої недоліки, Танкістка, безсумнівно, була унікальною у власний спосіб від самого початку. Що і подобалося читачам, адже вони хотіли бути на її місці. Стиль оповіді Алана Мартіна досліджує, як сатиричний гумор, так і скатологічний гумор, тоді як малюнок Джеймі Г’юлетта із часом еволюц��онує від густих, хаотичних мазків до більш прямих й кутастих ліній, які точно впізнають шанувальники його пізніших проектів.Художник Джеймі Г’юлетт надихався британським панк-гуртом The Undertones, і якщо ви не знайомі з ними, можете поцікавитися їхньою творчістю. А вже пізніше став частиною проекту The Gorillaz, британського віртуального музичного гурту, візуальний стиль до кліпів якого багато хто пам’ятає. Малюнок Г’юлетта — дикий, сміливий і дуже деталізований — черпає натхнення, як із панк-культури, так і з Looney Tunes (анімаційний серіал від Warner Bros.). Його власне мистецьке бачення привело його до великої популярності, як і в мальописній царині, так і в музичній.Ось це кольорове видання зображує культурну значущість у британській історії, якої Танкістка досягла із часом. Розпочавшись, як самвидавничий концепт двох студентів коледжу, ця героїня менш, ніж за десять років стала предметом численних антологій. І поміж підлітків Британії здобула великої популярності. Але виникає багато питань чи надалі вона є актуальною для сучасного читача. Тут можна сперечатися довго, але думаю більше ні, аніж так. Та залишається мальованою історією, яку цікаво досліджувати, як і будь-яку класику в мальописах чи інших видах мистецтва, і має мати своє місце на полиці. Це не є збірка, яку візьмеш і прочитаєш за один раз, поринувши в сюжет із головою. Краще виділити кілька днів, де кожного дня прочитаєш дві чи три історії, щоб не перевантажувати себе тим усім безладом, що там відбувається. Одним словом, купуйте та пробуйте. І ще добре, що видавництво вирішило надрукувати цей комікс у великому формату, це дуже допомагає під час читання через велику кількість тексту та дрібних деталей.",Comédie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/974942.Tank_Girl,Tank Girl.txt
